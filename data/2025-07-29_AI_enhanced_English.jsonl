However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal\nknowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses\nchallenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity\nrepresentation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or\ngate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in\nmulti-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of\nComplementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a\nComplementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an\nEntropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits\nboth intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and\nmulti-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we\nintroduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically\nprioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training\neffectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsurpassing existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoCME improves MMKGC by leveraging intra- and inter-modal complementarity and dynamic negative sampling, outperforming existing methods.", "motivation": "Address the imbalance and overlooked complementarity in multimodal knowledge graphs for better entity representation.", "method": "Proposes MoCME with CMKF for modality fusion and EGNS for dynamic negative sampling.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.", "conclusion": "MoCME effectively enhances entity representation and model robustness in MMKGC."}}

In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of\nthe tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution\nfor aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

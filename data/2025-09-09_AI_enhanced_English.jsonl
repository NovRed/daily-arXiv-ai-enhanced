By leveraging an\nedge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across\ndiverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:\n(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which\nsupports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and\nunstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into\nstandardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs\nintegrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate\nlightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three\nanonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,\nde-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize\nresponse latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier\ncaching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,\nand cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate\nthat HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,\ngeneration consistency, and system efficiency.

To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

One branch of\nthe law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination\nlaw. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the \"less\ndiscriminatory alternative\" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g.,\nmodel) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves\ncomparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort.\nNotably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant\n(the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI\ncases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet\nhigh-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most\nlitigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to\ntheir model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to\nreproduce a similar model from scratch.\n  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an\nLDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model\naccess. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic\nparity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we\nprovide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier\n(PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the \"low-resource\nregime,\" then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being\ncontested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus\nserves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the\nclaimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the\nclaimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small)\nmodels.

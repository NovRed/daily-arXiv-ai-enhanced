Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has\nemerged as a solution in domains like credit scoring. However, most XAI\nresearch focuses on post-hoc interpretation of black-box models, which does not\nproduce models lightweight or transparent enough to meet regulatory\nrequirements, such as those for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models.\n  This paper proposes a hybrid approach: post-hoc interpretations of black-box\nmodels guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models that\nmaintain both predictive power and transparency.\n  Using the Lending Club dataset, we demonstrate that this approach achieves\nperformance comparable to a benchmark black-box model while using only 10\nfeatures - an 88.5% reduction. In our example, SHapley Additive exPlanations\n(SHAP) is used for feature selection, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)\nserves as the benchmark and the base black-box model, and Explainable Boosting\nMachine (EBM) and Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) are the\ninvestigated glass-box models.\n  We also show that model refinement using feature interaction analysis,\ncorrelation checks, and expert input can further enhance model interpretability\nand robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hybrid approach using XAI for feature selection to create transparent glass-box models that maintain predictive performance while meeting regulatory requirements for credit scoring.", "motivation": "Machine learning models outperform traditional methods but lack transparency needed for regulated environments like banking.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-Random Forest model achieves 85.4% accuracy for automated dental condition classification in panoramic X-rays, outperforming custom CNN and pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop automated deep learning methods for classifying dental conditions (fillings, cavities, implants, impacted teeth) from panoramic X-ray images to support dental diagnostics.

Method: Used dataset of 1,512 radiographs with 11,137 expert annotations. Evaluated three approaches: custom CNN, hybrid models (CNN feature extraction + traditional classifiers), and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures (VGG16, Xception, ResNet50) with 5-fold cross validation.

Result: Hybrid CNN-Random Forest model achieved highest performance (85.4% accuracy), surpassing custom CNN baseline (74.3%). VGG16 performed best among pre-trained models (82.3% accuracy). Hybrid models improved discrimination of morphologically similar conditions.

Conclusion: Combining CNN-based feature extraction with ensemble classifiers provides efficient, reliable performance for automated dental diagnostic support, though larger datasets and further clinical validation are needed.

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align addresses attention leakage in zero-shot appearance transfer by using Query-Query alignment instead of Query-Key alignment, improving semantic mapping between images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image generation models suffers from Attention Leakage, where semantic mapping between images is compromised by Query-Key alignment issues.

Method: Q-Align introduces three components: Query-Query alignment for better spatial semantic mapping, Key-Value rearrangement for improved feature correspondence, and Attention refinement using rearranged keys/values to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation, as validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed Q-Align method effectively mitigates attention leakage and improves semantic alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache is a caching framework that accelerates diffusion model inference by 2x while maintaining quality through error analysis and correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from computational overhead due to iterative inference, and naive feature caching causes quality degradation, requiring a principled approach to enable efficient reuse.

Method: Proposes ERTACache with offline residual profiling to identify reusable steps, trajectory-aware correction coefficients for dynamic interval adjustment, and closed-form residual linearization for error approximation.

Result: Achieves up to 2x inference speedup across image and video generation benchmarks while preserving or improving visual quality, with minimal VBench degradation on Wan2.1 video diffusion model.

Conclusion: ERTACache effectively addresses caching-induced errors through principled analysis and correction, enabling significant acceleration while maintaining baseline fidelity in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TVS is a temporal visual screening method that improves Video-LLMs by focusing on critical video segments and simplifying queries while maintaining answer consistency, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and lack of inter-frame reasoning supervision, unlike humans who naturally perform temporal screening.

Method: Proposes Temporal Visual Screening (TVS) that retains focus-critical video segments, reconstructs queries to direct forms while preserving answer consistency, and maintains answer invariance. Formulated as a modular front-end adapter task.

Result: TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% during training and 34.6% during inference. The ReSimplifyIt baseline outperforms prior approaches by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance.

Conclusion: Temporal information screening through TVS effectively improves video-language understanding by optimizing reasoning burden distribution and cognitive load, demonstrating the importance of focusing on salient temporal segments.

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using skeletal pose annotations as a more efficient approach for surgical tool localization, introduces ROBUST-MIPS dataset combining pose and segmentation annotations, and demonstrates pose estimation methods achieve high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for surgical tool localization are limited by the availability of diverse annotated data. Pose annotations offer a better balance between semantic richness and annotation efficiency.

Method: Created ROBUST-MIPS dataset by enriching existing ROBUST-MIS dataset with tool pose annotations. Established benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and developed custom annotation software.

Result: High-quality results were observed using pose estimation methods for surgical tool localization, demonstrating the adequacy of pose annotations for this task.

Conclusion: Skeletal pose annotations are an efficient and effective alternative to segmentation for surgical tool localization, enabling accelerated growth of annotated datasets and improved computer-assisted interventions.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control is a plug-and-play safety patch that reduces unsafe content generation in Text-to-Image models to 7% while maintaining benign image quality, outperforming existing safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I model safety mechanisms are susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments, creating a need for more robust and adaptable solutions.

Method: Uses data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions to inject safety control signals into locked T2I models as patch-like updates, with flexible merging of multiple safety patches into a unified solution.

Result: Reduces unsafe content generation probability to 7% compared to ~20% for baseline methods, maintains benign image quality and text alignment, and works across six diverse T2I models with similar architectures.

Conclusion: Safe-Control provides an effective, adaptable plug-and-play safety solution that significantly outperforms existing safety mechanisms while maintaining compatibility with various T2I models.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV is a novel method for identifying target regions from natural language instructions and front camera images, specifically addressing challenges with stuff-type targets and multiple/absent targets through existence prediction and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underperform in handling stuff-type target regions with ambiguous boundaries, as well as cases with absent or multiple targets in navigation tasks.

Method: Proposed GENNAV which predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. Also created GRiN-Drive benchmark with no-target, single-target, and multi-target samples for evaluation.

Result: GENNAV achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation metrics. Real-world experiments with four automobiles in five distinct urban areas showed robust zero-shot transfer performance.

Conclusion: GENNAV demonstrates effective handling of stuff-type target regions and multiple/absent target scenarios, showing strong performance and robustness across diverse real-world environments for navigation tasks.

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B is an auto-thinking MLLM that adaptively decides when to use step-by-step reasoning based on problem complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs use step-by-step thinking for all problems, which is inefficient for simple problems that don't require complex reasoning.

Method: Uses bi-mode annealing to enable both thinking and non-thinking capabilities, followed by Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO) to improve decision-making on when to activate thinking. Trained on curated dataset with both modes and improved GRPO framework.

Result: Outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves comparable performance to larger 16B models on reasoning benchmarks with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: R-4B demonstrates efficient adaptive thinking capability, providing optimal performance while reducing unnecessary computational overhead for simple problems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

### [10] [HiddenObject: Modality-Agnostic Fusion for Multimodal Hidden Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21135)
*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject is a Mamba-based fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data to detect hidden or obscured objects, outperforming traditional unimodal methods in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB-based detection methods fail under adverse conditions like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations, creating a need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches.

Method: A fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using Mamba-based fusion mechanism to capture complementary signals across modalities and create unified representations.

Result: State-of-the-art or competitive performance across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets.

Conclusion: Mamba-based fusion architectures significantly advance multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded conditions, exposing limitations in current unimodal and naive fusion strategies.

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

### [11] [RadGS-Reg: Registering Spine CT with Biplanar X-rays via Joint 3D Radiative Gaussians Reconstruction and 3D/3D Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21154)
*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg is a novel framework for CT/X-ray registration that combines 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction with 3D/3D registration, using Counterfactual Attention Learning and patient-specific pre-training to achieve state-of-the-art performance on vertebral registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CT/X-ray registration methods suffer from spatial information loss and domain gaps, while current 3D reconstruction approaches require dense views and struggle with noisy X-rays, creating a need for more accurate and robust registration solutions.

Method: Joint 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction with 3D/3D registration, featuring Counterfactual Attention Learning mechanism for vertebral region focus in noisy X-rays, and patient-specific pre-training strategy for simulation-to-real adaptation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on in-house datasets for both reconstruction and registration tasks, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods by providing accurate vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration through innovative joint reconstruction and registration approach with attention mechanisms and adaptive training.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

*Kevin Mayer,Alex Vesel,Xinyi Zhao,Martin Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D is a large synthetic dataset of 6.2M 3D residential buildings with three modalities: LoD4 wireframe graphs, floor plan images, and LiDAR-like roof point clouds, enabling automated 3D building generation with semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating accurate 3D building models due to lack of large-scale annotated datasets, inspired by synthetic data success in computer vision.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset with over 6.2 million residential buildings represented through three modalities: semantically enriched 3D wireframe graphs (LoD4), floor plan images, and LiDAR-like roof point clouds with semantic annotations derived from floor plans.

Result: A publicly available large-scale multi-modal dataset that enables development of generative AI algorithms for automated 3D building model creation with semantic-geometric consistency.

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D provides a valuable resource for advancing 3D building generation research and can facilitate novel AI approaches for automated architectural modeling with semantic constraints.

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

### [13] [Radially Distorted Homographies, Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21190)
*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for estimating homographies with radial distortion across three different distortion configurations, providing faster minimal solvers while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homography estimation is crucial in computer vision, but real images often have lens distortions that require simultaneous estimation of both homography and radial distortion for accurate results.

Method: Proposes a novel unified mathematical framework to handle three distinct radial distortion configurations: distortion in one image, identical distortion in both images, and independent distortion in both images. Develops new minimal solvers based on this approach.

Result: The proposed solvers are faster than existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar accuracy. Tested successfully on established benchmarks including fisheye camera images.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive solution for radially distorted homography estimation that unifies previously separate cases, offering improved computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCAV is a novel framework that unifies Concept Activation Vectors across neural network layers into a single consistent representation using contrastive learning and attention-based fusion, improving concept consistency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAVs computed independently at different layers exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons unreliable and limiting their effectiveness for interpreting deep neural networks.

Method: Leverages contrastive learning to align concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion mechanism to construct globally integrated CAVs, with TGCAV for evaluation.

Result: Significantly reduces variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept relevance, mitigates concept inconsistency across layers, enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: GCAV provides a more comprehensive and interpretable understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts by integrating cross-layer information into a coherent framework.

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP is a novel framework that enables object re-identification models to generalize to unseen categories using in-context examples as prompts, without retraining, by combining LLMs and vision foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ReID methods are domain-specific and require costly labeled data for new categories, while self-supervised learning struggles to capture identity-sensitive features needed for ReID.

Method: VICP uses LLMs to infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, then guides a vision foundation model (like DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via dynamic visual prompts.

Result: VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen categories across ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks, demonstrating effective generalization to novel object categories.

Conclusion: The framework successfully aligns LLM-derived semantic concepts with VFM's pre-trained prior, enabling generalization to novel categories without dataset-specific retraining, representing a significant advancement in zero-shot ReID.

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegResNet models were evaluated for pancreatic tumor segmentation on two MRI datasets, showing moderate performance (DSC 0.56 for Task 1, 0.33 for Task 2) with challenges due to small datasets and MRI sequence variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pancreatic tumor delineation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability.

Method: Used SegResNet models within Auto3DSeg architecture with 5-fold cross-validation and STAPLE ensembling on region-of-interest focused MRI data. Task 1: 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI cases. Task 2: 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases.

Result: Task 1: DSC 0.56, 5mm DSC 0.73, HD95 41.1mm, MASD 26.0mm, RMSE 5164mm. Task 2: DSC 0.33, 5mm DSC 0.50, HD95 20.1mm, MASD 7.2mm, RMSE 17,203mm. Performance decreased for Task 2.

Conclusion: Results demonstrate challenges with small MRI datasets and sequence variability, but show potential for automated delineation. Emphasizes need for larger, standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

### [17] [Reverse Imaging for Wide-spectrum Generalization of Cardiac MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21254)
*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging is a physics-driven method that infers underlying spin properties from cardiac MRI images to enable domain adaptation and solve generalization problems across different imaging sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained segmentation models struggle with generalization across different cardiac MRI sequences due to image contrast variations from different protocols, despite being governed by the same fundamental spin properties.

Method: The method reversely infers spin properties (proton density, T1, T2) by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems regularized by a spin prior learned from mSASHA dataset using a generative diffusion model, enabling flexible image synthesis of arbitrary sequences.

Result: Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols, achieving wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Conclusion: The physics-driven approach provides interpretable latent variables through spin property estimation, fundamentally solving the generalization problem in cardiac MRI segmentation across diverse imaging sequences.

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

### [18] [PHD: Personalized 3D Human Body Fitting with Point Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21257)
*Hsuan-I Ho,Chen Guo,Po-Chen Wu,Ivan Shugurov,Chengcheng Tang,Abhay Mittal,Sizhe An,Manuel Kaufmann,Linguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD introduces a personalized 3D human mesh recovery approach that first calibrates user-specific body shape, then uses a shape-conditioned pose prior to improve 3D pose estimation accuracy from videos, outperforming traditional user-agnostic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HMR methods are user-agnostic and optimized for generalization, but they compromise 3D accuracy by not jointly accounting for person-specific body shapes and 3D pose plausibility when refining poses using 2D constraints.

Method: The pipeline decouples the process by first calibrating the user's body shape, then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned on that shape using a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer with Point Distillation Sampling loss.

Result: The approach improves both pelvis-aligned pose accuracy and absolute pose accuracy, effectively mitigating errors from over-reliance on 2D constraints. It's data-efficient (requires only synthetic data) and serves as a plug-and-play module for existing 3D pose estimators.

Conclusion: PHD demonstrates that personalized shape-aware pose estimation significantly outperforms traditional user-agnostic methods, providing more accurate 3D human mesh recovery while being versatile and data-efficient.

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

*Yuquan Bi,Hongsong Wang,Xinli Shi,Zhipeng Gui,Jie Gui,Yuan Yan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient diffusion-based 3D human pose estimation framework with hierarchical temporal pruning that reduces computational costs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate high-fidelity 3D human poses but their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements incur substantial computational costs that need to be addressed.

Method: Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy with three components: Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) for frame-level pruning, Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA for attention computation reduction, and Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) for semantic-level pruning via clustering.

Result: Reduces training MACs by 38.5%, inference MACs by 56.8%, improves inference speed by average 81.1% compared to prior diffusion methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HTP framework effectively reduces computational overhead of diffusion-based 3D human pose estimation while preserving critical motion dynamics and maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Print2Volume generates realistic synthetic 3D OCT fingerprints from 2D images to overcome data scarcity, achieving significant performance improvements in biometric recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost and time-consuming OCT data acquisition leads to scarce large-scale datasets, hindering development of deep learning models for 3D fingerprint recognition.

Method: Three-stage framework: 2D style transfer, 3D structure expansion network, and OCT realism refiner using 3D GAN to generate synthetic OCT fingerprints with authentic textures and noise.

Result: Generated 420,000 synthetic samples and reduced Equal Error Rate from 15.62% to 2.50% on ZJUT-EIFD benchmark through pre-training on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real data.

Conclusion: Print2Volume effectively addresses OCT data scarcity by generating high-quality synthetic 3D fingerprints, enabling significant improvements in biometric recognition performance.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLENDA is the first publicly available image dataset with region-based annotations for endometriosis detection in gynecologic laparoscopy videos, addressing the lack of medical data for computer vision research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of surgical recordings is time-consuming, and computer vision approaches for automated analysis require sample data that is scarce in the medical field, particularly for endometriosis detection.

Method: Created a specialized image dataset (GLENDA) containing region-based annotations of endometriosis in gynecologic laparoscopy videos through collaboration with leading medical experts.

Result: The dataset provides annotated surgical video frames with endometriosis regions, enabling development of computer vision and machine learning models for automated surgical video analysis.

Conclusion: GLENDA addresses the critical data scarcity problem in medical computer vision research and facilitates development of automated tools for surgical video analysis, treatment planning, and medical education.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

*Sabrina Kletz,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Heinrich Husslein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates surgical instrument segmentation and recognition in laparoscopic gynecology videos using region-based fully convolutional networks, achieving high accuracy for binary segmentation but facing challenges in multi-class instrument recognition due to instrument similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical videos provide detailed information but automatic content indexing for searchable archives remains challenging due to the specialized nature of medical video content.

Method: Used region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware instrument segmentation (binary classification) and instrument recognition (multi-class classification).

Result: Achieved high accuracy for instrument localization and segmentation even with limited training data, but multi-class instrument recognition proved challenging due to high similarity between surgical instruments.

Conclusion: While binary segmentation of surgical instruments from background is highly achievable, precise instrument type identification remains difficult due to the inherent visual similarity of different surgical instruments.

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Result: SatDINO outperforms state-of-the-art masked autoencoder (MAE) methods and achieves competitive performance across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and testing setups.

Conclusion: SatDINO demonstrates the effectiveness of contrastive self-supervised learning for remote sensing, with proposed enhancements (GSD encoding and adaptive view sampling) that can be independently applied to improve satellite imagery representation learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for
pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.
These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for generating 2D index maps and profiling mechanisms for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to enable automated content analysis and selection for AI algorithm development, addressing the lack of standardized metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSI collections lack standardized metadata, requiring manual inspection for AI algorithm cohort selection which is impractical for large collections with millions of images.

Method: Develops a general framework with 2D index maps and domain-specific profiling. Uses three-layer tissue map organization (source, tissue type, pathological alterations) with class assignments for WSI segments.

Result: Demonstrated in clinical pathology with common syntax/semantics for interoperability between catalogs. Enables automated content analysis for ML and graph-based WSI representations.

Conclusion: The proposed standard provides fine-grained WSI content information, enabling efficient automated selection and analysis for AI development across various medical domains.

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

TL;DR: ICPL enables unsupervised incremental learning using confidence-based pseudo-labels instead of human annotations, achieving competitive results with supervised methods and outperforming class-iNCD methods by 5+% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios require models to learn novel classes incrementally, but existing Class-Incremental Learning methods assume fully labeled datasets which is unrealistic. There's a need for unsupervised approaches that can learn from unlabeled data.

Method: Proposes ICPL (unsupervised Incremental Learning using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels) that replaces human annotations with confidence-based pseudo-labels, integrates them into various CIL methods, and uses confidence-based selection.

Result: ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Also demonstrates practicality on fine-grained datasets and suitability for resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: ICPL provides an effective unsupervised solution for incremental learning that eliminates the need for human annotations while maintaining competitive performance, making it suitable for real-world applications with limited labeling resources.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

*Francisco Caetano,Christiaan Viviers,Peter H. H. de With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedShift is a unified generative model for cross-domain translation between synthetic and real X-ray images using Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, enabling high-fidelity translation without paired data or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic medical data has domain gaps that limit its generalizability to real clinical settings, particularly in X-ray imaging where discrepancies exist in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue representation.

Method: Proposes MedShift, a class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges that learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports unpaired translation between multiple domains without requiring domain-specific training.

Result: Despite smaller model size than diffusion approaches, MedShift shows strong performance, remains flexible at inference, and can prioritize either perceptual fidelity or structural consistency. Introduced X-DigiSkull dataset for benchmarking.

Conclusion: MedShift provides a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging, bridging synthetic-to-real domain gaps with high-fidelity translation capabilities.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

*Dimitri Gominski,Martin Brandt,Xiaoye Tong,Siyu Liu,Maurice Mugabowindekwe,Sizhuo Li,Florian Reiner,Andrew Davies,Rasmus Fensholt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning approach for global-scale individual tree detection using 3-m resolution satellite imagery and simulated tree crowns with Gaussian kernels, trained on billions of lidar points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale monitoring of individual trees is limited by inadequate modeling, as existing global products only provide binary tree cover or canopy height without identifying individual trees.

Method: Uses deep learning with simulated tree crowns (Gaussian kernels of scalable size) to detect individual trees in PlanetScope imagery. Training leverages billions of points from airborne lidar data for both forest and non-forest areas.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R² = 0.81 against aerial lidar), shows balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrates improvement through fine-tuning with manual labels.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring that is adaptable to future satellite missions with improved imagery.

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

*Jiayu Yang,Weijian Su,Songqian Zhang,Yuqi Han,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M presents a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework for dynamic scenes that uses hierarchical Gaussian organization, hybrid deformation/spawning strategy, and adaptive masking to reduce training time while maintaining high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables real-time rendering but has limitations for dynamic scenes due to large data volume and prolonged training time per frame. The paper aims to address these scalability issues for streaming tasks.

Method: Hierarchical organization of Gaussian spheres by scale within anchor-based structure, hybrid deformation and spawning strategy for motion modeling, and bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism to remove static regions and prioritize informative viewpoints.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior visual quality while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed M framework successfully addresses the scalability challenges of 3DGS for dynamic scenes, achieving efficient training and high-fidelity rendering through its hierarchical structure and optimization strategies.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Junha Song,Yongsik Jo,So Yeon Min,Quanting Xie,Taehwan Kim,Yonatan Bisk,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 125M-parameter image captioning model achieves performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, but suffers from visual blindness. A novel Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework with DeepLens module addresses this by improving visual grounding through better attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying multimodal large language models on local devices is challenging due to high computational demands. There's a need for lightweight yet effective image captioning solutions for applications like video instruction systems and exploration robots.

Method: Developed a specialist model based on a 125M-parameter language model (56x smaller than LLaMA-7B). Created Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework with DeepLens module that extracts detailed visual representations by focusing on informative regions identified during initial glance.

Result: The lightweight model achieves performance comparable to large multimodal generalists. The framework effectively addresses visual blindness issues and enhances caption quality through improved visual grounding.

Conclusion: Small specialist models can serve as strong visual specialists for on-device applications. The proposed framework successfully mitigates visual blindness limitations through better attention mechanisms and visual representations.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: Foundation models show strong potential for AI-based dementia diagnosis but their integration into federated learning systems remains underexplored, particularly in decentralized clinical settings where data privacy is critical.

Method: Systematic evaluation of key design choices including classification head architecture, fine-tuning strategy (freezing vs full fine-tuning), and aggregation methods using large multi-cohort brain MRI dataset in federated learning framework.

Result: Classification head architecture substantially influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard federated averaging.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for deploying foundation models in decentralized clinical settings and highlights important trade-offs that should guide future federated learning method development for medical applications.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to

### [31] [Multi-Method Ensemble for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21463)
*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score that combines feature truncation and multiple scoring functions for improved out-of-distribution detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods either focus on single techniques or evaluate on specific OOD datasets, overlooking the potential of combining multiple solutions for better robustness.

Method: Theoretically and empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be effectively combined. Proposes MME score that unifies multiple OOD detectors into a single scoring function.

Result: MME significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Achieves average FPR95 of 27.57% on ImageNet-1K using BiT model, improving by 6% over best baseline.

Conclusion: Combining multiple OOD detection techniques through ensemble methods creates a more robust and effective solution that works well across various OOD scenarios and benchmarks.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

### [32] [Adversarial Patch Attack for Ship Detection via Localized Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21472)
*Chun Liu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes localized augmentation method for adversarial patch attacks on ship detection, focusing only on target regions to improve attack success rate and transferability while avoiding background interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DNN-based ship detection is vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, and existing data transformation methods often cause false detections due to over-augmentation of background/non-target areas.

Method: Localized augmentation that applies transformations only to target regions rather than entire images, reducing background interference and allowing loss function to focus on adversarial patch impact.

Result: Experiments on HRSC2016 dataset show increased success rate of adversarial patch attacks and improved transferability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The localized augmentation approach effectively enhances adversarial attack performance by minimizing unnecessary background interference and focusing on target regions.

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

### [33] [ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21496)
*Hao Lu,Jiahao Wang,Yaolun Zhang,Ruohui Wang,Xuanyu Zheng,Yepeng Tang,Dahua Lin,Lewei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELV-Halluc is the first benchmark for long-video hallucination in Video-MLLMs, focusing on Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH) where models generate incorrect outputs despite correct frame-level semantics due to aggregation errors in complex long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video hallucination benchmarks focus on short videos and oversimplify hallucination causes. SAH emerges when models fail to properly aggregate frame-level semantics into event-level groups, especially problematic in long videos with complex semantics.

Method: Introduces ELV-Halluc benchmark for systematic SAH investigation. Uses positional encoding strategies and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) with 8K adversarial data pairs to enhance semantic distinction within and across events.

Result: Confirmed SAH existence showing it increases with semantic complexity. Models more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Achieved 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio and improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAH is a critical hallucination type in long videos that requires specialized attention. Positional encoding and DPO strategies effectively mitigate SAH, demonstrating the importance of addressing semantic aggregation challenges in Video-MLLMs.

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

*Ronan Docherty,Antonis Vamvakeros,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A convolutional neural network is trained to upsample low-resolution foundation model features using input image reference, enabling efficient and high-quality segmentation of microscopy images with fewer labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based foundation models struggle with fine features in micrographs and large image sizes common in materials and biological image analysis, requiring a solution for better feature representation.

Method: Train a CNN to upsample low-resolution foundation model features with reference to the input image, then apply this upsampler network without further training to featurize and segment microscopy images.

Result: The upsampled features enable separation of hard-to-segment phases like hairline cracks, and interactive segmentation produces high-quality results faster with fewer labels compared to traditional convolutional networks.

Conclusion: The proposed upsampler network effectively enhances foundation model features for microscopy image analysis, providing efficient and accurate segmentation with reduced labeling effort.

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

*Hao Ruan,Jinliang Lin,Yingxin Lai,Zhiming Luo,Shaozi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCCM framework improves drone vision-language understanding through hierarchical cross-granularity contrastive learning and matching, achieving state-of-the-art performance on drone datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack fine-grained semantics for drone scenarios with wide field of view and complex compositional semantics, while hierarchical methods require precise entity partitioning that limits effectiveness in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes HCCM framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC) that captures hierarchical semantics without precise scene partitioning, and (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM) that evaluates local semantic consistency within global representations. Also introduces Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) mechanism for robustness against incomplete/ambiguous drone text descriptions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text retrieval) on GeoText-1652. Demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen ERA dataset with 39.93% mean recall, outperforming fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: HCCM effectively addresses challenges in drone vision-language understanding by capturing hierarchical semantics without rigid constraints, showing superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

*Ziwei Liao,Mohamed Sayed,Steven L. Waslander,Sara Vicente,Daniyar Turmukhambetov,Michael Firman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-image 3D scene reconstruction using Gaussian splats with latent diffusion to complete occluded areas, trained self-supervised from 2D images only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian splatting requires dense observations and fails at occluded areas. Regression-based methods produce blurry results and can't capture multiple plausible solutions for unobserved surfaces.

Method: Propose a generative approach using latent diffusion model conditioned on single images. Use Variational AutoReconstructor to learn latent space from 2D images self-supervised, then train diffusion model over this latent space.

Result: Generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples that complete occluded surfaces, enabling high-quality 360-degree renderings from single input images.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the ambiguity problem in 3D scene completion from single images by using generative modeling rather than regression, producing plausible and diverse reconstructions of occluded areas.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EZ-Sort reduces pairwise comparison annotation costs by 90.5% vs exhaustive methods and 19.8% vs prior work using CLIP-based pre-ordering and automated comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise comparisons are more reliable than absolute ratings but require O(n²) annotations, making them impractical for large datasets. Recent work reduced this to O(n log n), but further efficiency improvements are needed.

Method: 1) Hierarchical CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering without training, 2) Initializing bucket-aware Elo scores, 3) Uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort that replaces easy comparisons with automated ones.

Result: 90.5% reduction in human annotations compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and 19.8% reduction compared to prior work (n=100), while maintaining or improving inter-rater reliability across face-age, historical image, and retinal image datasets.

Conclusion: Combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling provides an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking tasks with significantly reduced human annotation burden.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

TL;DR: ECHO is a unified framework that recovers human pose, object motion, and contact from minimal egocentric head and wrist tracking using a Diffusion Transformer with three-variate diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling human-object interactions from egocentric perspective is important for wearable devices but largely unexplored, especially with minimal sensor data.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformer architecture with three-variate diffusion process to jointly model human motion, object trajectory, and contact sequence. Operates in head-centric canonical space and employs conveyor-based inference for variable-length sequences.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in egocentric HOI reconstruction, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with flexible input configurations.

Conclusion: ECHO successfully recovers three interaction modalities from minimal egocentric tracking, offering unprecedented flexibility and robustness for wearable device applications.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: Study evaluates how well general vision-language models handle urban scene reasoning, showing fine-tuning with synthetic CoT-supervised data significantly improves performance on challenging urban spatial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban scenes require fine-grained spatial reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth, but it's unclear how well general VLMs transfer these abilities to urban domains.

Method: Comparative study of BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5 with zero-shot evaluation and fine-tuning using synthetic VQA dataset constructed from street-view image predictions (segmentation, depth, detection) paired with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought answers.

Result: VLMs perform reasonably well zero-shot, but fine-tuning with synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially for challenging question types like negation and counterfactuals.

Conclusion: Urban spatial reasoning presents a new challenge for VLMs, and synthetic dataset construction is a practical approach for adapting general models to specialized domains.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for medical imaging either focus on single temporal contexts or are limited to classification/regression tasks, lacking fine-grained spatial prediction capabilities for temporal dynamics in disease progression and anatomical development.

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) - a generative trajectory method that learns underlying temporal distributions, can fall back to nearest image prediction, and supports 3D volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling.

Result: TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging across three public longitudinal datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for 4D medical image prediction.

Conclusion: TFM provides a robust baseline and unified framework for temporal medical image analysis, addressing the fundamental gap in fine-grained spatial predictions for temporal dynamics in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning framework combining CT scans and pathology slides outperforms traditional methods for predicting recurrence risk in kidney cancer, with pathology showing stronger prognostic value than radiology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma relies on the Leibovich score, which has limited patient-level resolution and excludes valuable imaging information, creating a need for more personalized prediction methods.

Method: Developed a modular deep learning framework using pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling to integrate preoperative CT scans and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images, testing unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion approaches.

Result: WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, with intermediate fusion achieving the best performance (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Radiology added value primarily through fusion with pathology data.

Conclusion: Foundation model-based multimodal integration is feasible for personalized ccRCC risk prediction, with pathology providing stronger prognostic information. Future work should focus on better fusion strategies, larger datasets, and improved CT encoders.

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: A Deep Unfolding Network for computer-generated holography that combines adaptive bandwidth-preserving modeling with complex-valued denoising to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction with improved flexibility and global feature capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based CGH methods face three main challenges: black-box end-to-end networks lacking interpretability, CNN-based approaches with limited receptive fields, and ASM-based methods constrained to finite near-fields.

Method: Proposes a Deep Unfolding Network that decomposes gradient descent into two modules: Adaptive Bandwidth-Preserving Model (ABPM) for wider working distances and Phase-domain Complex-valued Denoiser (PCD) with deformable self-attention for global feature capture.

Result: Achieves PSNR over 35 dB, outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real data, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with improved flexibility and working range.

Conclusion: The proposed DUN framework effectively addresses limitations of existing CGH methods by combining physical modeling with deep learning, providing interpretable, flexible, and high-performance holographic reconstruction.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: Interactive PET/CT lesion segmentation using promptable nnU-Net with Euclidean Distance Transform encodings for user clicks, achieving best performance in autoPET/CT IV challenge Task 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical practice benefits from human-in-the-loop approaches to refine automated lesion segmentation in PET/CT, addressing challenges like tracer heterogeneity and multi-center variability.

Method: Extended nnU-Net pipeline with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided foreground/background clicks as additional input channels using Euclidean Distance Transform, with online simulation of user interactions and custom point sampling.

Result: Ensemble of EDT-based models achieved strongest cross-validation performance, reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Promptable models enable efficient user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT, with EDT encodings consistently outperforming Gaussian kernels.

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

*Fatih Erdoğan,Merve Rabia Barın,Fatma Güney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel probabilistic projection mechanism for HD map construction that uses geometric mapping with confidence scores to improve accuracy and filter out hallucinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HD mapping approaches struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems and often hallucinate non-existent road elements when using standard attention-based projection techniques.

Method: Proposes a geometric mapping based on camera parameters adapted to the scene, with a probabilistic projection mechanism using confidence scores to refine alignment and filter irrelevant elements, plus improved temporal processing through selective accumulation of reliable information.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets show improved performance over state-of-the-art approaches, with better generalization and particularly pronounced improvements on nuScenes and long perception ranges.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic projection with confidence scoring effectively addresses hallucination issues in HD map construction and enables more accurate and reliable mapping from camera images to BEV space.

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

*Shashank Vempati,Nishit Anand,Gaurav Talebailkar,Arpan Garai,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes line-level OCR to bypass word segmentation errors and better utilize language models, achieving 5.4% accuracy improvement and 4x efficiency gain over word-based OCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Word-level OCR shifted the bottleneck from character segmentation to word segmentation errors. Line-level OCR can bypass word detection errors and provide larger context for better language model utilization.

Method: Transition from word-level to line-level OCR by processing entire lines instead of individual words, using sequence-to-sequence translation models with larger sentence context.

Result: 5.4% end-to-end accuracy improvement and 4 times efficiency improvement compared to word-based OCR pipelines. Created a new dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations.

Conclusion: Line-level OCR is a natural progression that improves both accuracy and efficiency, with potential to benefit from advances in large language models.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLORA is a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline using Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model with LoRA fine-tuning, achieving superior object detection performance with only 500 synthetic images and consumer-grade GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large diffusion models that require enterprise-grade GPUs and thousands of synthetic images for dataset augmentation.

Method: Uses Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model fine-tuned exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), dramatically reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

Result: Training object detectors with just 500 FLORA-generated synthetic images outperforms models trained on 5000 synthetic images from ODGEN baseline, achieving up to 21.3% improvement in mAP@.50:.95.

Conclusion: Quality and efficiency-focused approach with FLORA is more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation practical and accessible for real-world scenarios with only 10% of data and fraction of computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial perturbations create detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations, enabling 90% detection accuracy without model modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks but existing detection methods require expensive retraining, architecture changes, or degrade clean input performance.

Method: Monitor activation entropy in CNN layers without modifying the model, using parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16 to detect entropy shifts.

Result: Adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, achieving 90% detection accuracy with false positive/negative rates below 20%. Clean and adversarial entropy distributions are completely separable.

Conclusion: CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in activation patterns, enabling reliable adversarial detection through activation entropy monitoring without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with reading values from Digital Measurement Devices in real-world conditions with clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur common in AR applications.

Method: Developed CAD2DMD-SET tool using 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition to generate diverse synthetic DMD datasets. Created DMDBench validation set with 1,000 real-world images. Fine-tuned LVLMs using LoRA with synthetic data.

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET significantly improves LVLM robustness and performance in challenging DMD reading tasks. The tool will be released as open-source for community use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

TL;DR: A new self-supervised sound localization method called SSL-SaN that improves robustness against negative audio cases (silence, noise, offscreen sounds) and introduces new evaluation metrics and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual sound source localization methods perform poorly with low audio-visual semantic correspondence (silence, noise, offscreen sounds) and evaluations are limited to positive cases with single visible sound sources.

Method: Proposed a new training strategy incorporating silence and noise, creating SSL-SaN model. Introduced a new metric for alignment-separability trade-off, and extended IS3 dataset to IS3+ with negative audio.

Result: SSL-SaN achieves state-of-the-art performance in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval compared to other self-supervised models, with improved robustness against negative sounds.

Conclusion: The proposed training strategy, evaluation metric, and extended dataset address key limitations in current sound localization methods, providing better performance in both positive and negative audio scenarios.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

TL;DR: UItron is an open-source foundational model for GUI agents that addresses challenges in GUI automation through advanced data engineering, interactive infrastructure, and a curriculum reinforcement learning framework, achieving superior performance particularly in Chinese mobile app scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building GUI agents remains challenging due to scarcity of operation trajectories, lack of interactive infrastructure, and limitations in foundation models' initial capabilities. There's also a notable gap in Chinese language capabilities even in state-of-the-art solutions.

Method: Systematic data engineering strategies, establishment of interactive environment connecting Mobile and PC devices, supervised finetuning over perception and planning tasks, and curriculum reinforcement learning framework for complex reasoning and exploration in online environments.

Result: UItron achieves superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning. It demonstrates significant progress in Chinese app scenarios, with over one million steps of operation trajectories collected across top 100 most popular apps.

Conclusion: UItron propels GUI agents closer to real-world application by addressing key challenges through systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure, particularly advancing capabilities in Chinese mobile app interaction scenarios.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-DCA improves domain generalization for CLIP by enhancing domain awareness rather than forcing domain invariance, showing significant gains on challenging out-of-distribution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current domain generalization evaluation for foundation models like CLIP is inadequate because web-scale pretraining data may cover existing benchmarks, failing to test truly unseen scenarios. CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more out-of-distribution datasets.

Method: CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations) identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data, while encouraging domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from domain features.

Result: CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more out-of-distribution, within a challenging evaluation framework using 33 diverse datasets with quantified OOD scores.

Conclusion: Enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models, contrary to standard domain invariance approaches that can harm generalization by discarding beneficial domain-aware representations.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

*Qiyue Sun,Qiming Huang,Yang Yang,Hongjun Wang,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new video dataset of atypical unusual videos (sci-fi, animation, etc.) and demonstrates that incorporating such data during training consistently improves performance across three open-world learning tasks: OOD detection, novel category discovery, and zero-shot action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at generalizing to novel concepts in open-world settings, but most video learning research focuses on common typical data from closed sets. The authors want to explore how exposure to atypical unusual videos during training can benefit open-world learning capabilities.

Method: The researchers collected a new video dataset containing various types of atypical data. They fed these atypical videos into model training for representation learning and evaluated performance on three key open-world tasks: OOD detection, novel category discovery, and zero-shot action recognition.

Result: Even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently improved performance across all three tasks. Increasing categorical diversity of atypical samples boosted OOD detection. For NCD, smaller but more semantically diverse atypical datasets outperformed larger typical datasets. In ZSAR, semantic diversity helped models generalize better to unseen action classes.

Conclusion: Atypical videos provide significant benefits for visual representation learning in open-world settings. The findings encourage further research in this direction, supported by the newly proposed dataset of unusual video content.

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: Videos contain rich spatio-temporal information but remain under-explored in unsupervised continual learning. Prior work relies on supervised learning with labels and task boundaries, which is costly and impractical. uVCL addresses this gap while handling the computational challenges of video processing.

Method: Uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features from unsupervised video transformers as non-parametric probabilistic representation. Introduces novelty detection for incoming task data to dynamically expand memory clusters and enable knowledge transfer from previous tasks.

Result: The proposed methodology substantially enhances performance when learning many tasks successively. Evaluated on three standard video action recognition datasets (UCF101, HMDB51, Something-to-Something V2) without using labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses unsupervised video continual learning challenges, providing a non-parametric solution that effectively captures new knowledge across successive tasks while handling the computational demands of video data.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

*Omer Faruk Durugol,Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A nnU-Net-based approach with multi-stage pre-training and metric-aware ensembling achieves state-of-the-art PDAC segmentation from MRI, addressing data scarcity and poor contrast challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated PDAC segmentation from MRI is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast and limited annotated data, which the PANTHER challenge aims to address.

Method: Built on nnU-Net framework with deep multi-stage cascaded pre-training, starting from general anatomical foundation model, fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and target MRI modalities, using five-fold cross-validation and custom heterogeneous ensembles.

Result: Achieved top cross-validation Tumor Dice scores of 0.661 for Task 1 (T1-weighted) and 0.523 for Task 2 (T2-weighted), with state-of-the-art boundary precision (MASD 5.46 mm, HD95 17.33 mm for Task 1).

Conclusion: The work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized high-performance models in limited data scenarios, demonstrating effective metric-aware ensembling strategy for complex medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5 demonstrates superior performance over previous models in radiation oncology benchmarks, achieving 92.8% accuracy on multiple-choice exams and generating clinically useful treatment recommendations with rare hallucinations, though expert oversight remains essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-5's performance in clinical decision support for radiation oncology, specifically assessing its capabilities in both standardized testing and real-world clinical scenario applications.

Method: Used two benchmarks: ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (300 multiple-choice items) and 60 authentic radiation oncology vignettes. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations using Fleiss' kappa for reliability.

Result: GPT-5 achieved 92.8% accuracy on TXIT benchmark, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Vignette evaluation showed high correctness (3.24/4) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4) ratings with rare hallucinations. Low inter-rater reliability indicated clinical judgment variability.

Conclusion: GPT-5 shows significant improvement over previous models in radiation oncology applications but still requires expert oversight due to substantive errors in complex scenarios and the need for further improvement in correctness.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

### [56] [TMUAD: Enhancing Logical Capabilities in Unified Anomaly Detection Models with a Text Memory Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21795)
*Jiawei Liu,Jiahe Hou,Wei Wang,Jinsong Du,Yang Cong,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMUAD introduces a three-memory framework with text, object, and patch-level memory banks to unify structural and logical anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is challenging due to limited normal data, and existing methods rely on image feature extractors and memory banks that may not adequately capture logical relationships between objects.

Method: Proposes a Three-Memory framework with: 1) class-level text memory bank for logical anomalies using logic-aware text extractor, 2) object-level image memory bank preserving complete object contours, and 3) patch-level memory bank for structural anomalies. These banks retrieve similar normal images and compute fused anomaly scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets in industrial and medical domains.

Conclusion: The unified approach through collaborative memory banks effectively handles both structural and logical anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoCap is a flexible video model that handles promptable video object segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning using various input modalities (text, box, mask) to produce spatio-temporal masks with object-centric captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding objects in videos with fine-grained localization masks and detailed semantic properties is fundamental for video understanding, but obtaining annotated data is tedious and expensive.

Method: Propose VoCap model that processes videos with multimodal prompts. Annotate existing SAV dataset with pseudo object captions using VLMs on preprocessed videos with ground-truth masks. Train on SAV-Caption plus other image/video datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art results on referring expression video object segmentation, competitive performance on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and establishes benchmark for video object captioning.

Conclusion: VoCap provides a unified solution for multiple video understanding tasks and the SAV-Caption dataset enables scalable training for video object captioning.

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

*Yiming Lin,Yuchen Niu,Shang Wang,Kaizhu Huang,Qiufeng Wang,Xiao-Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reveals that verb classification in scene recognition is inherently multi-label due to semantic ambiguity, proposes a single positive multi-label learning approach, and introduces GE-VerbMLP with graph networks and adversarial training, achieving 3%+ MAP improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat verb classification as single-label, but this fails to address inherent ambiguity where multiple verb categories can reasonably describe the same image, leading to inaccurate scene understanding.

Method: Proposes reformulating verb classification as single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) and develops Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP) that combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves more than 3% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: Verb classification in scene recognition should be treated as a multi-label problem, and the proposed SPMLL framework with GE-VerbMLP effectively addresses the semantic ambiguity and label correlation challenges in scene recognition tasks.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveQA is a comprehensive benchmark for testing LLMs and MLLMs on driving knowledge, covering traffic rules, signage, and complex scenarios. It reveals model weaknesses in numerical reasoning and complex situations, while showing that fine-tuning improves performance and enhances downstream driving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving benchmarks focus on spatial and visual QA but lack comprehensive testing of traffic rule understanding and edge cases that human drivers must master to pass driving tests.

Method: Created DriveQA benchmark with extensive text and vision-based scenarios covering traffic regulations. Tested state-of-the-art LLMs and MLLMs, conducted fine-tuning experiments, and evaluated model sensitivity to environmental factors through DriveQA-V variations.

Result: LLMs/MLLMs perform well on basic traffic rules but struggle with numerical reasoning, complex right-of-way scenarios, sign variations, and spatial layouts. Fine-tuning improved accuracy, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection decisions. Pretraining enhanced downstream performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DriveQA provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating driving knowledge in AI models. Fine-tuning on this dataset significantly improves model performance across multiple driving-related categories and enhances generalization to real-world driving tasks.

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models in instructional dialogue, specifically focusing on structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring.

Method: Introduced symbolic scaffolding mechanism with short-term memory schema, conducted controlled ablation across five system variants, and evaluated using expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory with LLM-based evaluation framework.

Result: Full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity.

Conclusion: Architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs, supporting a processing-level account of how structural components influence cognitive behaviors.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based chatbots face limitations in scientific research due to hallucinations, limited domain knowledge, and lack of explainability, particularly in biomedical domains like Alzheimer's disease.

Method: Compiled 50 papers and 70 expert questions on Alzheimer's, constructed GraphRAG knowledge base, used GPT-4o for query answering, and compared GraphRAG with standard GPT-4o responses.

Result: Assessment of quality and traceability of GraphRAG systems compared to standard LLM approach, with development of accessible interface for researchers.

Conclusion: GraphRAG shows promise for improving reliability in domain-specific scientific applications, with provided tools enabling further evaluation in Alzheimer's research.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO is an LLM-augmented framework that integrates multiple medical ontology systems through dual-axis knowledge propagation (intra-ontology vertical and inter-ontology horizontal) to enhance medical concept representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on single ontology systems or multiple ontologies in isolation, missing cross-ontology connections that could enrich medical concept representations.

Method: Uses LLMs for graph-retrieval-augmented initialization of concept embeddings, then performs dual-axis knowledge propagation: vertical within ontology hierarchies and horizontal across different ontology systems at each level.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on two public datasets, with enhanced robustness in limited data scenarios and rare disease prediction.

Conclusion: LINKO successfully integrates multiple medical ontologies through dual-axis propagation, demonstrating improved concept representation learning and serving as an effective plug-in encoder for EHR predictive models.

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

TL;DR: TiG framework bridges LLMs' declarative knowledge with procedural skills through language-guided reinforcement learning, achieving competitive performance with less data while providing transparent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at complex reasoning but struggle with simple interactive tasks that require procedural knowledge, highlighting a gap between knowing about something and knowing how to do something.

Method: Think in Games (TiG) reformulates RL-based decision-making as language modeling, where LLMs generate language-guided policies refined through online reinforcement learning with environmental feedback.

Result: TiG achieves competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands compared to conventional RL methods while providing step-by-step natural language explanations.

Conclusion: TiG successfully bridges declarative and procedural knowledge, enabling LLMs to convert static knowledge into dynamic decision-making while maintaining reasoning and explanatory capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

### [65] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM is a comprehensive benchmark for audio-language models that standardizes evaluation across 10 key aspects including perception, reasoning, fairness, and safety, using both existing and new synthetic datasets to enable fair model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ALM evaluations lack standardization, measure limited capabilities, and omit important aspects like fairness and safety, making cross-model comparisons difficult.

Method: Created AHELM benchmark aggregating various datasets including new synthetic datasets PARADE (for stereotype avoidance) and CoRe-Bench (for conversational reasoning), with standardized prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Tested 14 ALMs and 3 baseline systems; Gemini 2.5 Pro ranked top in 5/10 aspects but showed group unfairness on ASR tasks, while baseline systems performed surprisingly well with one ranking 5th overall.

Conclusion: AHELM provides a holistic, standardized evaluation framework for ALMs that reveals important performance characteristics and fairness issues, serving as a living benchmark for ongoing model development and assessment.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,

Abstract: The focus of AI development has shifted from academic research to practical
applications. However, AI development faces numerous challenges at various
levels. This article will attempt to analyze the opportunities and challenges
of AI from several different perspectives using a structured approach. This
article proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including
Physical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer,
Orchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top. It also explains
how AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the
three-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we
describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we
discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies
on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development
paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs
and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss
the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI
agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry.
Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the
economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem. This article analyzes the
internet industry to provide predictions on the future trajectory of AI
development.

### [68] [A General Framework of Epistemic Forgetting and its Instantiation by Ranking Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21441)
*Christoph Beierle,Alexander Hahn,Diana Howey,Gabriele Kern-Isberner,Kai Sauerwald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes forgetting operations in epistemic states, proposing five general types and seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions, evaluated against postulates from logic programming and AGM theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study forgetting operations from an epistemic perspective in richer semantic structures beyond classical logics, bridging the gap between syntactical variable elimination and AGM belief contraction.

Method: The authors take an epistemic approach, lifting forgetting operations to the epistemic level using Spohn's ranking functions. They propose five general types of epistemic forgetting and instantiate them with seven concrete operations, then evaluate these against axioms from both logic programming and AGM theory.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of all seven concrete forgetting operations against the proposed postulates, highlighting differences and commonalities among the operators and offering a novel overview of epistemic forgetting.

Conclusion: The research successfully extends forgetting operations to epistemic states, providing a systematic framework for understanding and evaluating different types of epistemic forgetting with clear links to propositional logic foundations.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [69] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Learning lifted STRIPS models from partial state-action traces where states miss predicates and actions lack full arguments, using a new STRIPS+ formalism and SYNTH algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the realistic scenario where observed states are incomplete (missing predicates like blank position) and actions don't reveal all required arguments, unlike previous approaches that assumed full STRIPS states/actions.

Method: Introduce STRIPS+ formalism allowing implicit action arguments and limited existential quantification. Develop SYNTH algorithm that constructs stratified precondition expressions to ground implicit arguments from state-action traces.

Result: SYNTH algorithm is proven correct and complete, and shows scalability on traces from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Conclusion: The approach successfully handles more realistic model learning scenarios with partial observability, providing a formal framework and effective algorithm for learning STRIPS+ models from incomplete traces.

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

### [70] [MMSearch-Plus: A Simple Yet Challenging Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21475)
*Xijia Tao,Yihua Teng,Xinxing Su,Xinyu Fu,Jihao Wu,Chaofan Tao,Ziru Liu,Haoli Bai,Rui Liu,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus is a challenging multimodal web browsing benchmark with 311 tasks requiring fine-grained visual reasoning, iterative search, and cross-validation under noise, where current MLLMs struggle significantly even with search capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow workflows using image search and text-masking, failing to test genuine multimodal challenges like fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use.

Method: Created MMSearch-Plus benchmark using Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation procedure to seed questions requiring extrapolation from spatial cues (micro-text, layouts, signage) and temporal traces to out-of-image facts. Provided model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools.

Result: Best agent (o3) achieved 15.1% without search and 36.0% with search rollout. Strong open-source model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B) got 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 search rounds. Error analysis revealed failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and planning.

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus exposes significant limitations in current MLLMs' multimodal web browsing capabilities, particularly in fine-grained visual reasoning, iterative search under noise, and long-horizon planning, highlighting the need for more advanced multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

### [71] [Modeling Wise Decision Making: A Z-Number Fuzzy Framework Inspired by Phronesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21517)
*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed a computational framework using fuzzy logic with Z-numbers to measure wisdom as a multidimensional construct with confidence scores, showing validity through moral dilemma responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wisdom measures rely on self-reports and fail to capture the inherent uncertainty and humility in wise reasoning. A computational approach could improve psychological measurement and enable more humane AI systems.

Method: Used a fuzzy inference system with Z-numbers (wisdom score + confidence score) to analyze think-aloud responses to moral dilemmas. Mapped responses to 5 wisdom components using 21 rules with Gaussian kernel density estimation for membership functions.

Result: The system produced dual-attribute wisdom representations that showed modest but significant correlations with established scales while having negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting convergent and divergent validity.

Conclusion: Formalizes wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct using Z-numbers, advancing psychological measurement and providing AI systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that bridges computational rigor and human judgment.

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

### [72] [Counterfactual Scenarios for Automated Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21521)
*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Counterfactual scenarios for planning problems: minimal modifications to planning problem P such that it admits plans satisfying desired properties ψ, with computational complexity similar to plan computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual explanations in planning only show minimal plan modifications for different goals, but fail to capture higher-level problem properties. Need a framework to explain why certain desired properties cannot be achieved in the original problem.

Method: Propose counterfactual scenarios paradigm with two qualitative instantiations based on explicit quantification over plans satisfying ψ. Characterize computational complexity for different types of changes allowed on planning problem P.

Result: Generating counterfactual scenarios is often only as expensive as computing a plan for P, demonstrating practical viability. Provides framework for constructing practical algorithms.

Conclusion: Counterfactual scenarios offer a practical and computationally feasible approach to explain why desired properties cannot be achieved in planning problems, enabling better diagnosis and reasoning about problem characteristics.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI is a GenAI framework that simplifies healthcare process mining by integrating LLMs for automated interpretation and report generation, validated with sepsis data showing Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro as top performers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process mining in healthcare faces barriers including technical complexity, lack of standardization, and limited training resources, making it inaccessible to many potential users.

Method: Developed a comprehensive wrapper around PM4PY (Python) and bupaR (R) libraries, integrated multiple LLMs for automated process map interpretation and report generation, validated using sepsis progression data across four proof-of-concept scenarios.

Result: Framework successfully processed sepsis data with robust technical performance. LLM evaluation showed Claude Sonnet-4 (3.79/4.0) and Gemini 2.5-Pro (3.65/4.0) achieved highest consistency scores when assessed by automated LLM evaluators.

Conclusion: The integration of structured analytics with AI-driven interpretation represents a novel methodological advance for translating complex process mining results into actionable healthcare insights, making them accessible to diverse users.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for learning generalized landmarks from solved instances that capture domain patterns and repetition, enabling effective planning heuristics for new problems in the same domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional landmark extraction algorithms struggle with planning problems that require generalization across instances and capturing repetitive patterns in domains.

Method: Learn state functions independent of specific objects to create generalized landmarks, construct a directed landmark graph with loop possibilities for repetitive subplans, and use this graph as a heuristic for solving new problem instances.

Result: Generalized landmark graphs learned from small instances are effective for larger instances, with significant performance improvements when repetition loops are identified compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Generalized landmarks provide interpretable domain information that can be discovered from a small set of plans and significantly enhance automated planning performance by capturing repetitive patterns and domain structure.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many multi-agent planning problems like multi-robot navigation can be effectively modeled with deterministic actions and observations, but current Dec-POMDP solvers struggle with large-scale problems.

Method: Proposes Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP) method, building on Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies framework, specifically optimized for Det-Dec-POMDPs.

Result: IDPP enables efficient solving of large-scale Det-Dec-POMDP problems that current Dec-POMDP solvers cannot handle effectively.

Conclusion: The Det-Dec-POMDP framework and IDPP solver provide a practical approach for scalable multi-agent planning in deterministic domains like multi-robot navigation.

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Motivation: Bridge the gap between complex operations research outputs and business stakeholder understanding by making optimization results accessible through natural language and visualizations

Method: Combines mixed-integer optimization model for tactical inventory redistribution with LLMs for natural language summaries, contextual visualizations, and tailored KPIs. Uses AI agents, RESTful APIs, and dynamic UI for real-time interaction

Result: Case study demonstrates improved planning outcomes including stockout prevention, cost reduction, and service level maintenance

Conclusion: Framework successfully integrates optimization and LLMs for explainable decision support, with future extensions planned for private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural networks to enhance capabilities

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*) to an anytime algorithm called A-MHA* that finds initial suboptimal solutions quickly and continually improves them over time, inspired by Anytime Repairing A* concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA* can leverage multiple inadmissible heuristics for faster suboptimal solutions but is a one-shot algorithm that doesn't improve solutions over time and requires careful parameter tuning.

Method: Adapts Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) concepts into the MHA* framework to create an anytime version that preserves suboptimality and completeness guarantees while enabling continuous solution improvement.

Result: A-MHA* successfully extends MHA* to an anytime algorithm that finds feasible solutions quickly and improves them incrementally, with performance validated in 3-D path planning and sliding tiles puzzle domains.

Conclusion: The proposed A-MHA* algorithm enhances MHA* with anytime capabilities while maintaining its theoretical guarantees, providing a more practical approach for real-world applications requiring progressive solution improvement.

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY is a framework that preserves diverse AI model outputs instead of forcing consensus, treating biases as strengths and hallucinations as hypotheses for clinician verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AI bias elimination may be misguided since human reasoning inherently incorporates valuable biases from education, culture, and experience.

Method: Developed a proof-of-concept using 30+ large language models that preserves both consensus and minority views, documenting model-specific biases and treating hallucinations as provisional hypotheses.

Result: Created a minimum viable product that makes diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight, demonstrating how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning.

Conclusion: MEDLEY reframes AI imperfection as a resource, offering a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for trustworthy medical AI systems.

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

*Jiho Choi,Seojeong Park,Seongjong Song,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PosterForest is a training-free framework for automated scientific poster generation that uses hierarchical document structure representation and multi-agent collaboration to create high-quality posters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches neglect hierarchical document structure and semantic integration of textual/visual elements in scientific posters, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Uses Poster Tree hierarchical representation to encode document structure and visual-textual relationships. Employs multi-agent collaboration with specialized agents for content summarization and layout planning that coordinate iteratively with mutual feedback.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple academic domains. Achieves quality closest to expert-designed posters with superior information preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses hierarchical structure and semantic integration challenges in scientific poster generation through hierarchical representation and multi-agent collaboration, producing high-quality results comparable to expert designs.

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple

### [80] [Freeze and Conquer: Reusable Ansatz for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21730)
*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Variational quantum algorithm for TSP with compact permutation encoding and optimize-freeze-reuse strategy that reduces qubit requirements and eliminates costly structural search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantum algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem that is efficient on NISQ hardware by reducing qubit requirements and minimizing computational overhead through circuit reuse.

Method: Combines compact permutation encoding with optimize-freeze-reuse strategy: first optimizes circuit topology (Ansatz) on training instances using Simulated Annealing, then freezes and reuses the structure while only re-optimizing parameters for new instances.

Result: Achieved 100% optimal trip sampling for 4 cities, 90% for 5 cities, 80% for 6 cities, but dropped to ~20% for 7 cities, showing robust generalization for moderate sizes but scalability limitations.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effective generalization and dramatically reduces time-to-solution without degrading quality for moderate problem sizes, though scalability becomes challenging beyond 6-7 cities.

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

### [81] [Orientability of Causal Relations in Time Series using Summary Causal Graphs and Faithful Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21742)
*Timothée Loranchet,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical guarantees for orienting micro-level causal edges in time series using summary causal graphs from expert knowledge, even with cycles or bidirected edges at macro level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experts can provide high-level summary causal graphs that capture main causal relations in time series, but micro-level causal structure often remains unknown. The research aims to leverage this expert knowledge to improve causal discovery.

Method: The authors present conditions that guarantee orientability of micro-level edges between temporal variables given background knowledge encoded in summary causal graphs, assuming access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution.

Result: The results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at micro-level even in presence of cycles or bidirected edges at macro-level, enabling practical guidance for causal discovery in complex temporal systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert knowledge through summary causal graphs significantly improves causal inference from observational time series data, offering valuable theoretical foundations for practical applications.

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

### [82] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDP is a zero-shot test-time planning framework that uses tree-guided diffusion with bi-level sampling to overcome limitations of gradient guidance in non-convex, non-differentiable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient guidance performs poorly in real-world scenarios with non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Supervised planning approaches require task-specific training, limiting test-time flexibility.

Method: Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP) uses bi-level sampling: (1) diverse parent trajectories via training-free particle guidance for exploration, and (2) sub-trajectory refinement through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives.

Result: TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration tasks.

Conclusion: TDP provides an effective zero-shot planning framework that balances exploration and exploitation using only pretrained models and test-time rewards, addressing limitations of existing gradient-based methods.

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

*Yeawon Lee,Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent system simulating clinical team consultation improves diagnostic accuracy in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis from SOAP notes compared to single-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical narrative interpretation is critical but challenging to automate. Single LLM approaches lack robustness for high-stakes clinical tasks, requiring more reliable systems.

Method: Collaborative multi-agent system with Manager agent orchestrating specialist agents in hierarchical, iterative debate to reach consensus on clinical problems from SOAP note S and O sections.

Result: Dynamic multi-agent configuration showed consistently improved performance on 420 MIMIC-III notes for identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis compared to single-agent baseline.

Conclusion: Modeling clinical team reasoning offers promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools, though occasional groupthink susceptibility needs addressing.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

### [84] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBA introduces counterbias data augmentation that decomposes text into semantic triples and modifies them to disrupt spurious correlations, improving model robustness and reducing biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on spurious correlations in training data, leading to poor generalization and performance degradation on unseen data.

Method: CoBA operates at semantic triple level: decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, selectively modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations, and reconstructing text to generate counterbias data.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoBA improves downstream task performance, effectively reduces biases, and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience.

Conclusion: CoBA offers a versatile and robust solution to address challenges posed by spurious correlations in deep learning models.

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Conclusion: Provides new opportunities for studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports development of more equitable, age-aware content moderation systems.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit anchoring bias in price negotiations similar to humans, with reasoning models showing less susceptibility but personality traits having no significant correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cognitive biases like anchoring effect in LLMs during price negotiations and understand how factors like reasoning and personality influence this bias.

Method: Instructed seller LLM agents to apply anchoring effect in price negotiations and evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Analyzed relationship with reasoning capabilities and personality traits.

Result: LLMs are influenced by anchoring effect like humans. Reasoning models with longer chain of thought are less prone to the bias. No significant correlation found between personality traits and susceptibility to anchoring.

Conclusion: Findings contribute to understanding cognitive biases in LLMs and support development of safe, responsible LLM applications in society.

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with basic visual perception tasks despite excelling at complex reasoning, as shown by performance drops on the new Percept-V dataset containing 7200 simple generated images across 30 categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' performance on simple perception tasks using uncontaminated generated images with basic shapes, as limited testing had been done in this area despite their strong performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Created Percept-V dataset with 7200 program-generated images across 30 categories testing various visual perception skills, then evaluated state-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude) and LRMs (OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1).

Result: Significant performance drop with increasing problem complexity across all models and categories. Models showed similar accuracy trends, with some cognitive skills proving more difficult than others.

Conclusion: MLLMs have notable weaknesses in basic visual perception despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, revealing important limitations in their fundamental perceptual abilities.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive data-centric analysis of Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs), examining their co-evolution with scientific data, presenting taxonomies of scientific data and knowledge, reviewing over 270 datasets and 190 benchmarks, and outlining a shift toward closed-loop autonomous AI systems for scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex nature of scientific data poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring specialized approaches that differ from general NLP. The authors aim to reframe Sci-LLM development through a data-centric lens to address the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific nature of scientific corpora.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic review of Sci-LLMs across disciplines, analyze over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, examine 190+ benchmark datasets, and develop unified taxonomies of scientific data and hierarchical knowledge models. They emphasize data-centric analysis and evaluation protocols.

Result: The analysis reveals that Sci-LLMs require handling heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora with domain-invariant representations and cross-modal reasoning capabilities. The survey identifies a shift from static evaluations toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments.

Conclusion: The work outlines a paradigm shift toward closed-loop autonomous systems where Sci-LLM-based agents actively experiment and contribute to evolving knowledge bases, providing a roadmap for building trustworthy AI partners that accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: LLM evaluation scores are heavily biased by model identity labels, with Claude labels boosting scores and Gemini labels depressing them, regardless of actual content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how model identity labels influence LLM evaluation judgments in both self- and cross-model evaluation scenarios.

Method: Tested ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude evaluating blog posts under four label conditions (no labels, true labels, two false-label scenarios) using preference voting and quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness.

Result: Significant bias found: Claude labels consistently increased scores (+50pp preference votes, +12pp quality), Gemini labels decreased scores. False labels frequently reversed rankings. Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels while Claude's self-preference intensified.

Conclusion: Perceived model identity heavily distorts LLM evaluation judgments, necessitating blind or multimodel evaluation protocols for fair benchmarking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' ability to intelligently and adaptively gather information from users or external sources in multi-turn conversations.

Method: Uses sequential Bayesian experimental design framework, maximizing expected information gain (EIG) through iterative query selection, with innovations in EIG estimation and query proposal strategies.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains across 20-questions game and user preference inference tasks compared to direct prompting and other adaptive strategies.

Conclusion: BED-LLM provides a principled approach for LLMs to act as effective conversational agents by intelligently gathering information through Bayesian experimental design.

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Result: 350% increase in exact match accuracy (0.0400 to 0.1800), improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800, outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-flash.

Conclusion: Smaller, domain-optimized models provide computationally efficient solutions for safety analysis, enabling low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, with proposed exact match accuracy as new benchmarking methodology.

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pixel-based language model replaces text embeddings with visual word representations to defend against orthographic attacks and support multilingual text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks using multilingual characters, causing performance degradation due to subword tokenizer limitations.

Method: Propose pixel-based generative language model that renders words as individual images instead of using text-based embeddings.

Result: Evaluated on multilingual LAMBADA, WMT24, and SST-2 benchmarks, showing resilience to orthographic noise and effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Conclusion: Pixel-based representations provide stronger robustness against noisy inputs and enable compatibility with diverse multilingual writing systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

### [95] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised speech models do not show clear Critical Period effects in phonological acquisition, with delayed L2 exposure actually improving L2 performance and delayed L1 exposure causing L1 forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Critical Period effects observed in human language acquisition (difficulty acquiring L2 with delayed exposure onset and better L1 retention with delayed exposure offset) are present in self-supervised speech models, given the importance of spoken language in human acquisition.

Method: Trained self-supervised speech models with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training offsets on child-directed speech, then evaluated their phone discrimination performance.

Result: S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of Critical Period effects. Models with delayed L2 exposure onset performed better on L2, and delayed L1 exposure offset led to L1 forgetting (contrary to human CP effects).

Conclusion: Self-supervised speech models do not replicate human-like Critical Period effects in phonological acquisition, showing different patterns of language acquisition and retention compared to humans.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

*Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu,Feiyi Wang,Dan Lu,Junqi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) to accelerate self-consistency methods for hallucination detection by identifying redundant prefix tokens and using selective inference, achieving 3x speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-consistency methods for hallucination detection in LLMs suffer from high computational costs due to repeated generation, while current detection methods perform poorly at sentence-level or rely on domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Identifies redundancy in self-consistency methods through shared prefix tokens analysis, then proposes DMP with selective inference and annealed decoding to accelerate multi-response generation while maintaining semantic content.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves up to 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance, and it works consistently across different models, datasets, decoding strategies, and self-consistency baselines.

Conclusion: DMP provides an efficient solution for accelerating self-consistency methods in hallucination detection, with potential for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

### [100] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the Turing test through the lens of normality, arguing it tests average human intelligence rather than exceptional intelligence, and that current AI models like ChatGPT target artificial smartness rather than true artificial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and reinterpret the Turing test using the concept of normality, challenging conventional understandings of what constitutes artificial intelligence and how we should evaluate machine intelligence.

Method: Conceptual analysis and reinterpretation of the Turing test through statistical and normative understandings of normality, examining the test's requirements for average human-like behavior rather than exceptional performance.

Result: The analysis shows that the Turing test targets normal/average human intelligence requiring imperfect behavior, and that current large language models like ChatGPT are unlikely to pass because they target exceptional intelligence rather than normal human intelligence.

Conclusion: The Turing test is fundamentally about normal intelligence assessed by normalized aggregate judgments, and current AI models represent artificial smartness rather than true artificial intelligence; the deeper question is whether human cognition can be reduced to average/normal mind concepts.

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reproducibility challenges and performance discrepancies in automatic text summarization evaluation metrics, particularly with the rise of LLM-based methods.

Method: Conducted experiments across six representative metrics (including ROUGE and LLM-based methods like G-Eval, SEval-Ex) using a unified open-source framework applied to the SummEval dataset.

Result: Found significant discrepancies between reported and observed performances, revealing a structural trade-off: metrics with highest human alignment are computationally intensive and less stable. LLM-based methods show randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility.

Conclusion: Advocates for more robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic summarization assessment.

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: LLMs used as automatic review generators fail to detect flaws in research logic, showing no significant difference in reviews of papers with vs without logical errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities and limitations of automatic review generators (ARGs) in scholarly peer review, particularly their ability to detect faulty research logic which is crucial for maintaining scientific integrity.

Method: Developed a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests the skill of detecting research logic flaws under controlled conditions, testing various ARG approaches.

Result: Contrary to expectations, flaws in research logic had no significant effect on the output reviews generated by ARGs - they failed to detect logical inconsistencies in research papers.

Conclusion: Current ARG approaches lack the capability to identify faulty research logic, necessitating three actionable recommendations for future work and the release of counterfactual dataset and evaluation framework to the public.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Motivation: Medical applications require highly accurate and professionally aligned responses from MLLMs, but existing benchmarks focus on general capabilities rather than clinical requirements like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance.

Method: Created a multimodal dataset with 1,026 expert-annotated cases through a rigorous three-step process, evaluating 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs across six clinically critical dimensions.

Result: Revealed substantial challenges in aligning MLLM outputs with expert judgment, with baseline models showing significant performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench addresses the critical gap in medical reward model evaluation and demonstrates the need for specialized benchmarks to ensure clinical alignment in medical AI applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32

medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to identify fine-grained semantic subdimensions from word embeddings using a disentangled model, and validates neural plausibility through brain activation mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic dimension approaches use predefined coarse representations that miss finer conceptual distinctions, limiting understanding of how meaning is organized in language and the brain.

Method: Introduces Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) to decompose word embeddings into sub-embeddings encoding specific semantic information, then uses voxel-wise encoding models to map subdimensions to brain activation.

Result: Identifies interpretable semantic subdimensions with neural correlates, showing semantic dimensions are structured by distinct principles with polarity as a key decomposition factor.

Conclusion: The framework provides more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions that are cognitively and neuroscientifically plausible, advancing understanding of conceptual meaning organization.

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit ideological leanings with varying depth - some models have robust internal political representations while others are easily steerable. Steerability and sparse autoencoder analysis reveal quantifiable ideological depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability and coherence of ideological positions in LLMs beyond surface-level prompt manipulation, and investigate whether they possess robust internal political representations.

Method: Dual approach: 1) Measuring steerability using instruction prompting and activation steering to assess how easily models switch between liberal/conservative viewpoints; 2) Probing internal mechanisms using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify ideological features.

Result: Models vary significantly in ideological depth - some resist steering while others switch easily. One model contained 7.3x more political features than another similar-sized model. Targeted ablation of core political features in deep models produces consistent reasoning shifts, while shallow models show increased refusal rates.

Conclusion: Ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs, with steerability serving as a valuable indicator of their latent political architecture. Models can possess distinct and abstract ideological features that influence reasoning consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

*Xiaolong Wei,Bo Lu,Xingyu Zhang,Zhejun Zhao,Dongdong Shen,Long Xia,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents two AI-driven reward strategies to enhance creative writing in Small Language Models (SLMs) for Chinese greetings, showing that principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge outperforms traditional methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong creative writing capabilities but are computationally expensive. SLMs offer a lightweight alternative, but current methods like SFT lack novelty and RLHF is costly. The paper aims to develop efficient AI-driven approaches to enhance SLM creativity.

Method: Two RLAIF strategies: 1) RM trained on high-quality preference data from multi-agent rejection sampling, 2) Principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge with adversarial training and reflection mechanism for direct reward signals.

Result: Both approaches significantly improved creative output over baselines. The principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrated superior generation quality, better training efficiency, and reduced dependency on human-annotated data.

Conclusion: The principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge approach provides a more scalable and effective path for creative SLMs, with automated evaluation methods aligning well with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

*Sara B. Coutinho,Rafael M. O. Cruz,Francimaria R. S. Nascimento,George D. C. Cavalcanti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel automatic classifier selection method for fake news detection ensembles that prioritizes diversity through hierarchical clustering and performance evaluation, achieving top accuracy on 2 out of 6 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological biases make people vulnerable to fake news on social media. Ensemble methods help but depend on classifier diversity, which is challenging to achieve as models often learn redundant patterns.

Method: Proposes HierarchySelect: computes pairwise diversity between classifiers, applies hierarchical clustering to group them at different granularity levels, selects diverse pools per level, and incorporates performance metrics to ensure generalization.

Result: Experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets show the method achieves highest accuracy on two datasets compared to Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed diversity-focused classifier selection approach effectively improves ensemble performance for fake news detection across multiple domains and class configurations.

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality human-annotated sentence similarity datasets for Marathi language and improve performance on sentence similarity tasks in low-resource settings.

Method: Created a uniformly distributed dataset across six score buckets (0-5 range), fine-tuned MahaSBERT model on this dataset, and benchmarked against MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT models.

Result: MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity tasks in Marathi, demonstrating the importance of human-curated annotations and structured supervision.

Conclusion: The combination of human-annotated dataset with balanced supervision and targeted fine-tuning significantly improves sentence similarity performance in Marathi, providing valuable resources for low-resource language NLP.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity
tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations,
targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Middo is a self-evolving framework that dynamically optimizes LLM training data using model-aware selection and refinement, improving accuracy by 7.15% while maintaining dataset scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection and synthesis approaches are limited by static dataset curation that fails to adapt to evolving model capabilities, creating a need for dynamic data optimization.

Method: A closed-loop system with: (1) self-referential diagnostic module using tri-axial model signals (loss patterns, embedding cluster dynamics, self-alignment scores), (2) adaptive optimization engine that transforms suboptimal samples while preserving semantics, (3) continuous evolution through dynamic learning principles.

Result: Consistently enhances seed data quality and boosts LLM performance with 7.15% average accuracy improvement while maintaining original dataset scale across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models, enabling continuous improvement as model capabilities evolve.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Motivation: To understand if users with different personality traits systematically prefer certain LLMs over others in collaborative multi-turn workflows.

Method: Study with 32 participants across four Keirsey personality types, evaluating interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four collaborative tasks (data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval, writing assistance) with sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback.

Result: Significant personality-driven preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4 for goal-oriented tasks, Idealists favored Claude 3.5 for creative and analytical tasks. Other types showed task-dependent preferences. Aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models.

Conclusion: Personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations miss, showing systematic preferences based on personality traits despite similar overall helpfulness ratings.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Misviz benchmark with 2,604 real-world misleading visualizations and Misviz-synth synthetic dataset of 81,814 visualizations to detect and classify 12 types of visualization misleaders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading visualizations spread misinformation on social media, but AI model development is limited by lack of large, diverse datasets for training and evaluation.

Method: Created benchmark datasets (real-world Misviz and synthetic Misviz-synth), then evaluated state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers on detection and classification tasks.

Result: The task of detecting misleading visualizations remains highly challenging despite using advanced models and large datasets.

Conclusion: Released comprehensive datasets and code to support future research in combating visualization-based misinformation, highlighting the ongoing difficulty of this detection problem.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CPI-FT framework addresses task interference in multi-task fine-tuning by identifying core parameter regions, grouping similar tasks, and using parameter fusion techniques to prevent performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning suffers from the 'seesaw phenomenon' where improving performance on some tasks comes at the expense of others due to indiscriminate parameter updates.

Method: Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning: 1) Independently fine-tune on each task to identify core parameter regions, 2) Group tasks with similar core regions, 3) Transplant core parameters and integrate non-core parameters via SLERP, 4) Use lightweight pipelined SFT while freezing core regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant alleviation of task interference and forgetting, consistently outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines on multiple public benchmarks.

Conclusion: CPI-FT framework effectively mitigates destructive interference in multi-task fine-tuning through strategic parameter isolation and fusion, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENTAT combines prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning to significantly improve performance on reasoning-intensive regression tasks where traditional methods struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reasoning-intensive regression (RiR) tasks where LLMs and standard finetuning methods underperform due to limited training data and the need for deep text analysis to deduce subtle numerical properties.

Method: Propose MENTAT - a method combining batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning, tested on three realistic RiR benchmark problems.

Result: MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient descent.

Conclusion: While MENTAT shows substantial improvements, there remains significant room for future advances in reasoning-intensive regression tasks.

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiCSAR is a training-free method that uses joint log-likelihood of reasoning and final answer to score candidate solutions in best-of-n sampling, achieving significant performance gains with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-n sampling improves LLM/LRM accuracy but requires effective scoring functions for reasoning tasks without ground-truth answers. Current methods struggle to identify correct reasoning chains.

Method: PiCSAR scores candidate generations using joint log-likelihood of reasoning and final answer, which decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence components.

Result: Substantial gains across benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforms baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in 16/20 comparisons.

Conclusion: Correct reasoning chains exhibit higher reasoning and answer confidence, validating PiCSAR's effectiveness as a simple, training-free scoring method for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs heavily rely on web-scale datasets like Common Crawl, but indiscriminate web crawling creates data quality, safety, and ethical challenges. Prior research was limited to small samples due to computational constraints.

Method: Developed an ElasticSearch-based pipeline for indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets, applied to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages).

Conclusion: The framework provides practical tools for safer and more accountable AI systems by enabling efficient analysis of large-scale training datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common

*Thanasis Schoinas,Benjamin Guinard,Diba Esbati,Richard Chalk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes hybrid clustering pipeline for transaction counterparty data using string similarity, topic modeling, and hierarchical clustering to overcome limitations of NLP models and fuzzy matching in banking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language techniques fail with short, unstructured transaction counterparty data in banking systems like SWIFT, creating gaps in fraud detection and payment tracing that current fuzzy matching tools don't adequately address.

Method: Hybrid pipeline combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, and rule-based approaches that handles unknown cluster numbers and uses precision/recall metrics for evaluation.

Result: Significantly improved performance over baseline rule-based keyword approaches on real-life labeled datasets, with better risk control for entity variation detection in sanctions investigations.

Conclusion: The approach reduces manual review needs while maintaining interpretability of rule-based systems, providing better entity clustering for financial investigation and fraud detection workflows.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

TL;DR: This survey paper explores reinforcement learning's transformative role in healthcare, moving from predictive models to active decision-making systems that optimize long-term patient outcomes through trial, feedback, and reward optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fundamental shift in healthcare AI from passive prediction to active intervention systems, recognizing RL's potential to optimize long-term clinical outcomes while addressing the unique challenges and risks in healthcare applications.

Method: The paper structures RL techniques including model-based/model-free methods, offline/batch-constrained approaches, and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration. It analyzes applications across critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance through information fusion lens.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive analysis of RL applications in healthcare, identifying trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks while critically examining ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges specific to clinical environments.

Conclusion: RL represents a transformative shift toward agentive clinical intelligence in healthcare, serving as both a technical roadmap and critical reflection for developing safe, human-aligned policy learning systems that go beyond prediction machinery to active clinical decision support.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

*Abdul Rehman,Ilona Heldal,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified EEG emotion classification framework using LSTM-GRU achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1-score 0.932) on multigranularity emotion recognition tasks including binary valence, multi-class, and multi-label classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG emotion recognition studies focus narrowly on binary valence or subject-specific classification, limiting generalizability and real-world deployment in affective computing systems.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with structured preprocessing (temporal window segmentation, hybrid statistical/frequency feature extraction, z-score normalization) and evaluates various models including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, LSTM, LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM on the GAMEEMO dataset with 14-channel EEG recordings from 28 subjects.

Result: LSTM-GRU model consistently outperforms others, achieving F1-score of 0.932 in binary valence classification, 94.5% accuracy in multi-class emotion classification, and 90.6% accuracy in multi-label emotion classification.

Conclusion: The proposed multigranularity framework demonstrates superior performance in EEG-based emotion recognition, with LSTM-GRU emerging as the most effective architecture for handling complex emotion classification tasks across multiple granularities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

*Wenfeng Feng,Penghong Zhao,Guochao Jiang,Chuzhan Hao,Yuewei Zhang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PVPO is a critic-free RL method that uses advantage reference anchors and data pre-sampling to improve efficiency and avoid local optima, achieving SOTA performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing critic-free RL methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and intra-group comparisons, which can lead to local optima and high computational costs.

Method: Uses a reference model for advance rollouts to calculate reward scores as reference anchors, and employs data pre-sampling to assess sample difficulty and select high-gain data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine datasets across two domains, demonstrating robust generalization and scalable performance across different model sizes.

Conclusion: PVPO effectively addresses cumulative bias issues, reduces reliance on multiple rollouts, and improves training efficiency while maintaining strong performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

*Tatyana Matveeva,Aleksandr Katrutsa,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGram is a full-matrix adaptive optimizer that uses symmetric factorization and low-rank approximations to enable efficient parameter correlation modeling while maintaining scalability for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagonal adaptive methods like Adagrad cannot capture parameter correlations, while full-matrix methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale optimization problems.

Method: Uses fast symmetric factorization for preconditioned updates and maintains low-rank preconditioner structure using matrix integrator methods to reduce memory and computational costs.

Result: AdaGram converges faster or matches diagonal adaptive optimizers using rank five and smaller approximations on standard machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: AdaGram provides a scalable solution for full-matrix adaptive optimization, enabling efficient modeling of parameter correlations in large models.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three

time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work

*Evan J. Chou,Lisa S. Locke,Harvey M. Soldan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning system for NASA's Deep Space Network anomaly detection using predictive analysis, reinforcement learning for severity classification, and LLM explanations with human feedback integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NASA's Deep Space Network facilities degrade over time, causing costly disruptions to spacecraft communications. Need automated methods to detect anomalies and equipment degradation to maintain operations for future space missions.

Method: Researched ML techniques for data reconstruction through predictive analysis, statistical computations with thresholds for real-time anomaly detection. Added reinforcement learning subsystem for severity classification and LLM for anomaly explanations. Implemented full data pipeline system connecting extraction, parsing, and processing workflows with agentic AI system for complex reasoning.

Result: Developed complete data pipeline system for DSN transmitters and connected models trained from antenna data, completing the anomaly detection workflow. System can pinpoint anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data.

Conclusion: Successfully created an integrated AI system for DSN anomaly detection that combines machine learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM capabilities with human feedback for continuous improvement, enabling better maintenance and operations of critical space communication infrastructure.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes PILOT, a contextual bandit approach for adaptive LLM routing that uses shared embedding space and online learning to select optimal models without exhaustive inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised routing methods assume complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings, but real-world scenarios lack comprehensive mappings and face evolving queries.

Method: Develops shared embedding space for queries and LLMs aligned to reflect affinity, learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback using PILOT (LinUCB extension). Includes cost policy as multi-choice knapsack problem.

Result: Enables adaptive decision-making using bandit feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries.

Conclusion: Contextual bandit formulation with shared embeddings provides effective and resource-efficient LLM routing solution for dynamic real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

*Joshua Ward,Chi-Hua Wang,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Gen-LRA, a novel membership inference attack that detects privacy leakage in synthetic data by exploiting generative model overfitting through likelihood ratio analysis without requiring model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on heuristics and unreasonable assumptions, showing limited capability to detect privacy exposure through synthetic data release.

Method: Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA) - a No-Box MIA that evaluates test observation influence on surrogate model's estimation of local likelihood ratio over synthetic data, requiring no model knowledge or access.

Result: Gen-LRA consistently dominates other MIAs across diverse datasets, model architectures, and attack parameters in comprehensive benchmarking.

Conclusion: Gen-LRA is an effective privacy auditing tool that highlights significant privacy risks from generative model overfitting in real-world synthetic data applications.

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Echo State Networks struggle with long-term information processing, limiting their effectiveness in time series tasks.

Method: Introduces deep untrained RNNs with temporal residual connections, studying orthogonal configurations and providing mathematical stability analysis.

Result: Significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling, outperforming traditional shallow and deep Reservoir Computing approaches.

Conclusion: DeepResESNs provide a superior framework for time series processing with enhanced stability and performance over conventional ESNs.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FUTURE is a novel gradient-based unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles that addresses data privacy and right to be forgotten requirements by formulating forgetting as an optimization problem using probabilistic approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for tree ensembles are model-specific and rely on discrete tree structures, making them difficult to generalize and inefficient for large datasets, especially with increasing emphasis on data privacy and right to be forgotten.

Method: Formulates forgetting as gradient-based optimization using probabilistic model approximations to handle non-differentiability of tree ensembles, enabling end-to-end unlearning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show FUTURE achieves significant and successful unlearning performance.

Conclusion: FUTURE provides an effective and efficient solution for unlearning in tree ensembles, overcoming limitations of existing methods through gradient-based optimization with probabilistic approximations.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

### [129] [Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186)
*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a mathematical framework viewing LLM decoding as a constrained variational optimization on the probability simplex, showing that next-token distributions follow smooth trajectories converging to softmax equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the intuitive understanding of LLM decoding as "manifold traversal" and provide rigorous mathematical foundations for common decoding practices like temperature scaling and sampling methods.

Method: Models decoding as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex, using multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) updates and analyzing the continuous-time replicator flow to prove convergence properties.

Result: Proves that next-token distributions follow smooth trajectories converging to softmax equilibrium, with temperature acting as exact time rescaling and top-k/nucleus sampling restricting flow to simplex faces with identical guarantees.

Conclusion: Provides a formal mathematical framework for understanding LLM decoding dynamics, offering precise explanations for temperature scaling and sampling methods while establishing connections to variational optimization principles.

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

*Haoze Wu,Cheng Wang,Wenshuo Zhao,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterintuitive RL phenomena in LLMs only work when models already have strong task alignment; standard RL remains robust across all settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RL advances in LLMs show surprising phenomena like single-example learning and negative-only training, but it's unclear when these actually work versus when they fail.

Method: Systematic examination of counterintuitive claims through rigorous experiments across different model architectures and task domains, measuring Model-Task Alignment via pass@k accuracy.

Result: Counterintuitive results (single-example learning, inaccurate rewards, negative-only training) only occur when pretrained models already have strong task alignment. These techniques fail in challenging regimes where standard RL remains effective.

Conclusion: Model-Task Alignment is the key factor determining when counterintuitive RL phenomena work. Standard RL training is consistently robust, while novel techniques are only effective in specific favorable conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel generative continual learning framework using self-organizing maps (SOMs) and VAEs for memory-efficient replay without storing raw data or task labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory inefficiency in continual learning by eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Combines self-organizing maps (SOMs) with variational autoencoders (VAEs) - SOM operates in latent space for high-dimensional inputs (CIFAR) and standalone for low-dimensional inputs (MNIST). Stores running statistics (mean, variance, covariance) for each SOM unit to generate synthetic samples for replay.

Result: Competitive with state-of-the-art memory-based methods, outperforms memory-free methods, improves SOTA single class incremental performance by ~10% on CIFAR-10 and ~7% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning that also enables visualization and can serve as a generative model post-training.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

*Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning Mixture of Experts framework that dynamically combines three state-of-the-art CFD surrogate models (DoMINO, X-MeshGraphNet, FigConvNet) using a gating network with entropy regularization, achieving superior accuracy over individual models and ensemble averages on automotive aerodynamic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of CFD simulations hinder automotive design optimization, and while ML-based surrogates offer acceleration, no single architecture demonstrates universal superiority across diverse scenarios.

Method: Proposes a Mixture of Experts model with a gating network that learns spatially-variant weightings to combine predictions from three heterogeneous surrogate models (DoMINO, X-MeshGraphNet, FigConvNet), using entropy regularization to prevent model collapse and ensure balanced expert contributions.

Result: The MoE framework achieves significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming both ensemble averages and the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities (surface pressure and wall shear stress fields) on the DrivAerML dataset.

Conclusion: The MoE framework establishes an effective strategy for creating robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining complementary strengths of specialized neural network architectures in computational fluid dynamics.

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) is a new gradient-based method that improves upon attribution patching by using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation coefficients, providing more accurate approximation of activation patching with similar computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation patching is computationally expensive at scale, while attribution patching suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep non-linear networks. There's a need for a more faithful and efficient method to localize model components responsible for specific behaviors.

Method: Relevance Patching replaces local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which propagates the network's output backward through layers using local propagation rules that ensure relevance conservation and improved signal-to-noise ratio.

Result: RelP significantly outperforms standard attribution patching, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.956 vs 0.006 for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large on the IOI task. It maintains computational efficiency (only two forward passes and one backward pass) while providing comparable faithfulness to Integrated Gradients without the extra computational cost.

Conclusion: Relevance Patching offers a more accurate and faithful approximation of activation patching than standard gradient-based methods, making it a valuable tool for scalable mechanistic interpretability in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOwen is an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values for client contribution estimation in federated learning, achieving better accuracy with the same computational budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating client contributions in federated learning is crucial for fair rewards and faster convergence, but exact Shapley value computation is computationally infeasible for large federations.

Method: Proposes FedOwen framework using Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values efficiently, with adaptive client selection that balances exploitation of high-value clients and exploration of under-sampled ones.

Result: FedOwen achieves up to 23% higher final accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks under fixed valuation cost.

Conclusion: FedOwen provides an efficient and effective solution for client contribution estimation in federated learning, enabling better model performance while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0 introduces a framework to measure machine learning models' cold-start adaptability by tracking cumulative errors during sequential learning, revealing systematic differences in early-phase efficiency across model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML evaluation focuses on final accuracy but overlooks the cumulative cost of adaptation - the mistakes made while learning from scratch, which is crucial for real-world applications where models need to perform well from the beginning.

Method: Defines four evaluation tracks (Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch) to measure cold-start adaptability. Models sequentially label unlabeled datasets, predict labels, receive ground truth, and update parameters. Uses oracle reference bands and tests classical methods, CNNs, ResNets, and pretrained transformers on MNIST and AG News datasets.

Result: Smaller models adapt with fewer initial errors, pretraining benefits vary by domain, and all current models remain well above the oracle band, highlighting a significant adaptability gap in early learning phases.

Conclusion: G&L provides a reproducible framework that complements conventional benchmarks by quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, enabling development of models that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the first examples.

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

TL;DR: CALM is an adaptive real-time anomaly detection framework that uses continuous fine-tuning and LLM-based anomaly judgment to handle concept drift in time-series streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline-trained anomaly detection models degrade when faced with concept drift in non-stationary time-series data, requiring adaptive solutions.

Method: Built on Apache Beam with TimesFm foundation model, featuring continuous fine-tuning and LLM-as-a-Judge component for semantic anomaly evaluation.

Result: Improves ROC AUC scores on TSB-UAD benchmark compared to static models, demonstrating effective adaptation to evolving data patterns.

Conclusion: CALM provides an effective end-to-end solution for maintaining high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments through adaptive learning and LLM guidance.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

*Yibin Sun,Nick Lim,Guilherme Weigert Cassales,Heitor Murilo Gomes,Bernhard Pfahringer,Albert Bifet,Anany Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates domain shift detection in EMG signals using data stream learning techniques, revealing limitations of current drift detection methods for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in myoelectric activations are challenging due to EMG signal non-stationarity, requiring effective detection methods for stable EMG decoding models.

Method: Used DB6 dataset from Ninapro database, defined domains as time-series segments by subjects/sessions, applied KPCA with cosine kernel for preprocessing, and evaluated CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and ADWIN drift detection methods.

Result: Current drift detection techniques show limitations in achieving high performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals.

Conclusion: Streaming-based approaches show potential for maintaining stable EMG models but need further research to improve robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO is a lifelong learning framework that uses generative models instead of storing raw data, inspired by biological wake-sleep cycles to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining privacy and storage efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in continual learning including data privacy concerns, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are dissimilar, without relying on storing previous task samples or complex regularization.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Wake phase - rapidly learn new task and train compact generative model (G-mem) to capture data distribution; 2) Sleep phase - use all G-mem models to generate pseudo-data and consolidate knowledge into core feature extractor via knowledge distillation.

Result: Significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks on both computer vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News) benchmarks compared to sequential fine-tuning baseline.

Conclusion: MyGO framework effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while offering privacy and storage advantages by retaining only compact generative models instead of raw data, demonstrating domain-generality across vision and NLP tasks.

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

### [139] [Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300)
*Yejin Kim,Eunwon Kim,Buru Chang,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA is a novel machine unlearning framework that improves upon FILA by better accounting for Fisher information assumptions, enabling more accurate parameter identification for sensitive data removal while achieving 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can unintentionally generate sensitive information, and while machine unlearning offers a solution, existing methods like FILA have limitations including inaccurate parameter importance estimation and high computational costs from requiring full model access.

Method: VILA explicitly considers the fundamental assumptions underlying Fisher information that were overlooked in FILA, enabling more accurate identification of parameters associated with forget sets without needing to access the entire model.

Result: VILA achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed compared to FILA, while setting new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE.

Conclusion: VILA provides an efficient and effective solution for machine unlearning that addresses the limitations of previous methods, significantly reducing computational costs while improving accuracy in removing sensitive information from LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

### [140] [Convergence of regularized agent-state-based Q-learning in POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21314)
*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for analyzing convergence of Q-learning algorithms that use agent states (like RNNs) and policy regularization, showing convergence to regularized MDP fixed points under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the convergence behavior of practical Q-learning algorithms that use agent states (not belief/information states) and policy regularization, which are common in practice but lack theoretical analysis.

Method: Analyzes regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) - the simplest form of such algorithms. Uses theoretical analysis to prove convergence under mild technical conditions to fixed points of appropriately defined regularized MDPs.

Result: Shows RASQL converges to the fixed point of a regularized MDP that depends on the behavioral policy's stationary distribution. Also extends analysis to periodic policy variants. Numerical examples confirm empirical convergence matches theoretical limits.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for convergence of practical Q-learning algorithms with agent states and regularization, demonstrating they converge to well-defined regularized MDP solutions, with empirical validation supporting the theoretical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [141] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE improves sparse autoencoders by scoring features across token batches and sampling from a candidate pool, balancing global consistency vs fine-grained reconstruction through tunable parameter l.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TopK SAE is inefficient as it treats all tokens equally, while BatchTopK risks an "activation lottery" where rare high-magnitude features crowd out more informative lower-magnitude ones.

Method: Score feature columns via L2 norm or entropy to form candidate pool of size Kl, then apply Top-K selection across tokens from this restricted feature pool. Parameter l controls the spectrum between batch-level and token-specific selection.

Result: On Pythia-160M, no single l value optimizes all metrics - best choice depends on trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction fidelity, and downstream performance.

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE reframes BatchTopK as a tunable, distribution-aware family that allows balancing global consistency and fine-grained reconstruction based on specific application needs.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

### [142] [Stage-Diff: Stage-wise Long-Term Time Series Generation Based on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21330)
*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stage-Diff is a staged diffusion model for long-term time series generation that addresses complex temporal dependencies and data distribution shifts through stage-wise generation and progressive sequence decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term time series present challenges with complex long-range temporal dependencies, gradual data distribution shifts over time, and intricate inter-feature relationships that existing generative models struggle to handle effectively.

Method: A staged diffusion model with stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer to preserve long-term dependencies while modeling distribution shifts. Uses progressive sequence decomposition for channel-independent modeling at different time scales, combined with multi-channel fusion for inter-stage information transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks, demonstrating its ability to handle complex temporal patterns and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Stage-Diff successfully addresses the key challenges of long-term time series generation by balancing long-term dependencies with data distribution shifts, and effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies through its staged architecture.

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLGAN is a dual-layer GAN model for time series synthesis that decomposes generation into feature extraction and reconstruction stages, using autoencoder supervision and GAN to ensure temporal dependencies and feature accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series synthesis methods struggle with temporal dependencies and feature capture when modeling directly on random sequences, leading to poor quality generated time series.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Sequence feature extraction and reconstruction forming a complete autoencoder for supervised learning, 2) GAN to generate synthetic feature vectors aligned with real sequence features.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate superior performance across various evaluation metrics compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DLGAN effectively addresses temporal dependency and feature capture challenges in time series synthesis through its dual-layer architecture combining autoencoder supervision and GAN generation.

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

### [144] [Adaptive Heavy-Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21353)
*Bodu Gong,Gustavo Enrique Batista,Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AHTSGD is a novel optimization algorithm that adaptively injects heavy-tailed noise during early training to enhance exploration and transitions to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes, improving generalization and convergence to wide basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overreliance on training loss in large neural networks by leveraging insights about wide basins promoting better generalization and empirical observations of heavy-tailed gradient noise and Edge of Stability phenomenon.

Method: Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD) that dynamically adjusts injected noise tail-heaviness based on training stage - heavier noise early for exploration, lighter noise later as sharpness stabilizes.

Result: Outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10 benchmarks with significant gains on noisy datasets like SVHN. Accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across clean and noisy settings.

Conclusion: AHTSGD effectively promotes convergence to wide basins through adaptive noise injection, demonstrating robustness to learning rate choices and superior generalization performance compared to existing optimization methods.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

TL;DR: Analysis of Leela Chess Zero's policy network shows strong monotonic improvement in playing strength across layers, but policy distributions follow non-smooth trajectories with early correct solutions being discarded and poor correlation between intermediate and final outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether neural networks build representations through smooth refinement or more complex computational processes, specifically examining chess policy networks compared to language models.

Method: Extended the logit lens technique to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, examining playing strength, puzzle-solving ability, and policy distribution trajectories across network layers.

Result: Found strong monotonic trends in playing strength and puzzle-solving ability across layers, but policy distributions showed non-smooth trajectories with correct puzzle solutions discovered early then discarded, poor move ranking correlation with final outputs, and high policy divergence until late layers.

Conclusion: Chess policy networks exhibit different representation building patterns than language models, with non-smooth computational processes despite monotonic performance improvements, contrasting with the smooth distributional convergence typically seen in language models.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general and flexible mixture modeling framework that can handle both parametric and nonparametric components from different distribution families while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Partition the data into subsets and fit separate density estimators to each partition. The framework supports both parametric and nonparametric estimators and can combine components from different distribution families.

Result: PMODE achieves near-optimal rates for its estimator class and remains valid with heterogeneous mixture components. MV-PMODE scales to thousands of dimensions and performs competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Conclusion: PMODE provides a simple yet effective modular framework for mixture modeling that works with diverse component types and scales to high-dimensional problems while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using mobile network data and reservoir computing to monitor network states through proxy task performance analysis


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a non-invasive, low-cost method for monitoring communication and mobility networks using readily available data

Method: Transform mobile network utilization data into reservoir computing models (echo state networks), use neuroscience-inspired proxy tasks to measure model performance, and analyze how performance relates to network state

Result: Performance on proxy tasks correlates with network state and visibly decreases when networks are perturbed, demonstrating the method's effectiveness

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept approach shows promise for near-real-time monitoring and identifying weak spots in mobile communication and transportation networks

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

TL;DR: CoM is a layer-wise merging method that addresses internal covariate shift in model merging by updating activation statistics auto-regressively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging techniques treat layers independently, failing to account for inter-layer dependencies and causing distributional mismatches similar to internal covariate shift.

Method: Chain of Merges (CoM) - a layer-wise merging procedure that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion to explicitly account for cross-layer interactions through conditionally optimal updates.

Result: CoM effectively mitigates degradation caused by covariate shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoM provides a coherent merging approach that properly handles inter-layer dependencies, addressing the critical challenge of merging specialized models without retraining while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Novel GAN-based framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing, with hybrid quantum/classical approach showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous biomanufacturing requires robust early anomaly detection as minor deviations can compromise yield, stability, and economic performance due to complex non-linear dynamics and intricate variable relationships.

Method: Ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for unsupervised anomaly detection, benchmark dataset simulation, and evaluation of hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach using both simulated quantum circuit and real photonic quantum processor.

Result: The GAN-based framework effectively detects anomalies from sudden feedstock variability, and the hybrid quantum/classical approach yields improved anomaly detection rates.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum/classical approaches show potential for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes through enhanced anomaly detection.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

*Xinyi Sheng,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL algorithm that combines standard expected cumulative reward optimization with time-average growth rate to improve individual trajectory performance in real-world deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL optimizes expected cumulative reward (ensemble average), but this may not reflect individual trajectory performance in real-world applications where optimizing long-term performance of individual trajectories is more important.

Method: Proposes a Bellman operator for time-average growth rate, uses geometric mean under multiplicative reward dynamics, and introduces a modified geometric mean with N-sliding window estimator for general reward dynamics. Embeds this as a regularizer into the objective function.

Result: The algorithm outperforms conventional RL methods in challenging simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines ensemble average and time-average optimization, enabling policies to benefit from both perspectives simultaneously for improved real-world performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

### [151] [Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code-Length on Riemannian Manifold Data Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21466)
*Kota Fukuzawa,Atsushi Suzuki,Kenji Yamanishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML) - a coordinate-invariant extension of Normalized Maximum Likelihood for Riemannian manifolds, particularly useful for hyperbolic spaces in graph data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NML formulations are Euclidean-based and coordinate-dependent, making them unsuitable for Riemannian manifolds like hyperbolic spaces that better represent hierarchical graph structures.

Method: Defines Rm-NML that reflects Riemannian geometric structure, extends computational techniques to manifolds, and derives simplification methods for Riemannian symmetric spaces including hyperbolic spaces.

Result: Developed coordinate-invariant Rm-NML that coincides with conventional NML in Euclidean space under natural parameterization, with explicit computation demonstrated for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: Rm-NML provides a geometrically meaningful extension of NML to Riemannian manifolds, enabling model selection and regret minimization in non-Euclidean data spaces like hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CByG is a novel gradient-based conditional generative framework that extends Bayesian Flow Networks to generate molecules with high binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity, outperforming baseline models in comprehensive evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SBDD methods focus primarily on binding affinity but neglect critical real-world drug discovery requirements like synthetic feasibility and selectivity, creating a gap between academic research and practical applications.

Method: Extends Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model (CByG) that integrates property-specific guidance for multiple pharmacological properties simultaneously.

Result: CByG significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria including binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of conventional diffusion models and provides a practical solution for real-world drug discovery with comprehensive property optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

*Pascal R. van der Vaart,Neil Yorke-Smith,Matthijs T. J. Spaan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian deep Q-learning shows a cold posterior effect where performance improves with lower temperature, contrary to theory. Common Gaussian likelihood assumptions are violated, requiring better priors and likelihoods for improved Bayesian RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study why Bayesian deep Q-learning exhibits a cold posterior effect (performance improves with lower temperature) and challenge common assumptions about likelihoods and priors in Bayesian model-free RL algorithms.

Method: Empirical study of prior distributions and statistical tests to validate likelihood assumptions. Development and testing of simple, implementable solutions for better priors in deep Q-learning.

Result: Found that Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated in practice. Demonstrated that improved priors lead to more performant Bayesian algorithms.

Conclusion: Future Bayesian reinforcement learning research should focus on developing more suitable likelihoods and priors rather than just improving posterior approximation accuracy.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

### [154] [Failure Prediction Is a Better Performance Proxy for Early-Exit Networks Than Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21495)
*Piotr Kubaty,Filip Szatkowski,Metod Jazbec,Bartosz Wójcik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early-exit models with confidence-based exit strategies may not benefit from calibration methods as expected. Calibration measures can be misleading, and miscalibrated networks sometimes outperform calibrated ones. Failure prediction is proposed as a better proxy for early-exit performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of confidence-based exit strategies in early-exit models, where calibration methods may not improve actual performance and can even be counterproductive.

Method: The paper demonstrates empirical cases showing miscalibrated networks outperforming calibrated ones, and proposes using failure prediction instead of calibration as a performance measure for early-exit models.

Result: Calibration measures are shown to be misleading indicators - well-calibrated classifiers may still waste computation, and common calibration methods don't preserve sample ranking. Failure prediction shows strong correlation with efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: Failure prediction is a more useful and dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models compared to calibration, as it accounts for sample ranking changes and better correlates with efficiency gains.

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

*Vishal Pandey,Debasmita Biswas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNN-DT combines spiking neural networks with Decision Transformers for ultra-low-power reinforcement learning, achieving comparable performance with 10,000x energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based RL agents consume too much energy for edge devices, while spiking neural networks offer ultra-low-power inference but haven't been integrated with return-conditioned sequence modeling.

Method: Embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into self-attention blocks, uses surrogate gradient training, three-factor plasticity, spike-based positional encodings, and dendritic routing.

Result: Matches/exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on control benchmarks while emitting <10 spikes per decision, indicating 4+ orders-of-magnitude energy reduction.

Conclusion: SNN-DT enables real-time, low-power control on embedded devices by combining sequence modeling with neuromorphic efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

*Israel Abebe Azime,Deborah D. Kanubala,Tejumade Afonja,Mario Fritz,Isabel Valera,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with tabular data fairness in loan approvals. Serialization format choice significantly impacts both performance and fairness, with some formats improving F1 scores but worsening fairness disparities. ICL boosts performance but has inconsistent fairness effects across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes financial decision-making like loan approvals, there's a critical need to assess their performance and fairness when processing tabular data from different geographic regions.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from Ghana, Germany, and US, focusing on zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities with different serialization formats (GReat, LIFT, etc.).

Result: Serialization format significantly affects both performance and fairness - some formats yield higher F1 scores but exacerbate fairness disparities. ICL improved performance by 4.9-59.6% over zero-shot but had varying fairness effects across datasets.

Conclusion: Effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware models are crucial for improving LLM reliability in financial decision-making applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

*Geri Skenderi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNN-based SAT solvers suffer performance degradation on harder instances due to negative graph curvature causing oversquashing of long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly on harder Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) and determine if this reflects fundamental architectural limitations.

Method: Analyze SAT problem graphs through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC) to quantify local connectivity bottlenecks, prove that bipartite graphs from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and validate claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks.

Result: Found that curvature decreases with instance difficulty, curvature is a strong indicator of problem complexity, and can predict GNN performance. Confirmed that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing.

Conclusion: Negative graph curvature explains GNN performance limitations on hard SAT instances due to oversquashing, providing insights for future solver design and connecting to existing solver principles.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data minimization for recommender systems is technically feasible but practically challenging due to dependence on technical settings and user characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operationalizing the legal principle of data minimization for recommender systems that rely on extensive personal data remains a significant challenge.

Method: Proposed a novel problem formulation, analyzed various minimization techniques, and investigated key factors influencing their effectiveness for minimizing implicit feedback inference data.

Result: Substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss, but practicality depends on technical settings (performance targets, model choice) and user characteristics (history size, preference complexity).

Conclusion: While technical feasibility is established, data minimization remains practically challenging and its context-dependent nature makes universal standards for data 'necessity' difficult to implement.

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation with 15 male and 15 female participants using quantitative signal quality indices, rhythm analysis, machine learning classification, morphological ECG analysis, and investigation of electrode projection angle effects - all stratified by sex and tested across various activity phases.

Result: The textile system achieved signal quality highly concordant with reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, showed robust classification performance, and enabled identification of key sex-specific determinants affecting signal acquisition.

Conclusion: Textile-based ECG garments are practically viable for physiological monitoring and psychophysiological state detection, with sex-specific design considerations being essential for equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach

(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are popular neural solvers for PDEs, typically trained with stochastic gradient descent methods. However, existing convergence guarantees were limited to gradient descent, leaving a gap in understanding the convergence behavior of stochastic optimization methods which are more commonly used in practice.

Method: The authors analyze stochastic gradient descent/flow for over-parameterized two-layer PINNs with general activation functions. The key challenge is handling dynamic randomness from stochastic optimization, and the analysis focuses on ensuring positive definiteness of suitable Gram matrices during training.

Result: The paper establishes linear convergence of stochastic gradient descent/flow in the high probability sense for training over-parameterized two-layer PINNs, extending previous gradient descent results to stochastic optimization methods.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical guarantees for stochastic optimization methods in training PINNs, offering insights into the optimization dynamics and ensuring that neural networks trained by stochastic algorithms maintain convergence properties similar to deterministic methods.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision theory algorithms are valuable for data-efficient scientific discovery but their theoretical analyses are often inaccessible to non-experts, limiting broader understanding and development of next-generation algorithms.

Method: Provides a self-contained introduction to theoretical analysis of probabilistic decision-making algorithms, assuming only basic probability/statistics knowledge and elementary Gaussian processes understanding.

Result: The monograph makes theoretical analyses of bandit algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms more accessible to a wider audience beyond experts in the field.

Conclusion: By making theoretical analyses more accessible, this work aims to facilitate better understanding of decision-making algorithms and support development of improved algorithms for scientific discovery applications.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,

Motivation: To understand and predict social media engagement patterns from emotional and temporal metadata, particularly for music content where engagement prediction is valuable for content creators and platforms.

Method: Multi-target regression using HistGradientBoostingRegressor trained on 600 songs with valence, arousal, sentiment metrics, and log-transformed engagement ratios to handle skewed data. Evaluation uses both custom order-of-magnitude accuracy and standard regression metrics.

Result: Model achieves R² = 0.98 for likes prediction but only R² = 0.41 for comments prediction, indicating emotional/temporal features plus view counts effectively predict likes but not comments.

Conclusion: Likes are driven by affective and exposure signals captured by emotional/temporal features, while comments depend on additional unrepresented factors, suggesting different engagement mechanisms for different interaction types.

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

### [167] [Activation Subspaces for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21695)
*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActSub: A novel OOD detection method using SVD to decompose model activations into decisive and insignificant components, achieving state-of-the-art performance by handling both Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability of deep models in real-world applications by better distinguishing in-distribution (ID) samples from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, particularly addressing the limitations of existing methods in handling different types of distribution shifts.

Method: Utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) of the classification head's weight matrix to decompose model activations into decisive components (maximally contributing to classifier output) and insignificant components (minimally contributing). The method combines both subspaces: insignificant components for Far-OOD detection and decisive components for Near-OOD detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across various standard OOD benchmarks. The insignificant subspace proves more effective for large distribution shifts (Far-OOD) as it remains unaffected by classification objectives, while the decisive subspace works better for smaller shifts (Near-OOD) by avoiding interference from insignificant components.

Conclusion: ActSub provides a unified approach that effectively handles both Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios by leveraging complementary information from different activation subspaces, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in OOD detection tasks.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

*Siddharth Mangalik,Ojas Deshpande,Adithya V. Ganesan,Sean A. P. Clouston,H. Andrew Schwartz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes adapting Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Design (LRDD) into statistical learning framework to forecast mental health discontinuities and slope changes from local events, showing improved performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital for public health policy, but traditional forecasting alone offers limited insights into causal impacts of events.

Method: Adapts LRDD from econometrics into statistical learning framework that predicts future discontinuities and slope changes using location's score history, dynamic covariates, and exogenous variables.

Result: Best results achieved by integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates, with strong improvements (r=+.46 for discontinuity, r=+.65 for slope) over traditional static community representations.

Conclusion: Discontinuity forecasting enables estimating idiosyncratic effects of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities, showing the framework is effective though the task remains difficult.

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser generates X-ray pulses at 1 MHz rates with data throughput exceeding 1 TB/s, requiring real-time ML data reduction but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency for high-speed experiments.

Method: Developed SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) for FPGA deployment with dynamic weight updates, and Auto-SNL Python extension to convert neural network models to SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code.

Result: Benchmark comparison against hls4ml showed SNL achieves competitive or superior latency in most architectures and offers FPGA resource savings in some cases.

Conclusion: SNL demonstrates versatility for real-time ML inference, enabling new opportunities in high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics and other fields requiring high-speed data processing.

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

*V. Bugra Yesilkaynak,Emine Dari,Alican Mertan,Gozde Unal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniMLR introduces a new multi-label ranking paradigm that leverages ranking among positive labels to model implicit class relevance as probability distributions, unifying ranking and classification tasks while addressing dataset scarcity through synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLR frameworks only use positive/negative label bipartition and ignore ranking information among positive labels, missing valuable relevance signals. Current datasets also suffer from scarcity and annotation bias.

Method: Proposes UniMLR framework that models class relevance as probability distributions using positive label rankings. Introduces eight synthetic Ranked MNIST datasets with controlled significance factors to address dataset limitations.

Result: Statistical analysis shows the method accurately learns positive rank order consistent with ground truth and proportional to underlying significance values. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate framework effectiveness.

Conclusion: UniMLR successfully unifies ranking and classification in MLR by exploiting positive label ranking information, providing a more comprehensive approach that captures implicit class relevance through probability distributions.

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

*Peng Yang,Zhengdong Huang,Zicheng Xie,Wentao Tian,Jingyu Liu,Lunhong Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed framework for heart rate prediction that handles data heterogeneity through random feature dropout for source heterogeneity and time-aware attention with contrastive learning for user heterogeneity, achieving 17-15% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data heterogeneity challenges in real-world heart rate prediction, specifically source heterogeneity from different devices and user heterogeneity from individual physiological differences.

Method: Uses random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, time-aware attention module for long-term physiological traits, and contrastive learning for discriminative representations.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines by 17% on ParroTao dataset and 15% on FitRec dataset, with strong discriminative representation power demonstrated.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses both source and user heterogeneity in heart rate prediction, showing significant performance improvements and practical value for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

*Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-Health is a Mixture of Experts framework for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare that handles incomplete modality data and outperforms existing methods on clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world healthcare data often has varied or incomplete modalities, but existing approaches require complete data or manual selection strategies, limiting practical applicability in clinical settings.

Method: Proposes MoE-Health framework with specialized expert networks and dynamic gating mechanism that dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities.

Result: Achieves superior performance on MIMIC-IV dataset across three clinical tasks (mortality prediction, length of stay, readmission) while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns.

Conclusion: MoE-Health effectively integrates multimodal information, offers improved predictive performance and robustness for heterogeneous healthcare data, making it suitable for diverse healthcare environments.

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

### [173] [QR-LoRA: QR-Based Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21810)
*Jessica Liang,Anirudh Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QR-LoRA: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses QR decomposition to extract an orthonormal basis from pretrained weights, then trains only scalar coefficients for linear combinations, achieving strong performance with dramatically fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA requires learning both update factors directly, while SVD-based variants are computationally expensive and produce hard-to-interpret singular vectors. There's a need for more efficient and interpretable parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Method: Extract orthonormal basis from pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, then express LoRA update as linear combination of these basis vectors while training only the scalar coefficients.

Result: QR-LoRA matches or exceeds performance of full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA on GLUE tasks with only 601 parameters - 1000x reduction vs full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA.

Conclusion: QR decomposition provides an effective alternative to SVD for LoRA initialization, enabling extremely parameter-efficient fine-tuning while maintaining or improving performance through clear structural constraints on adaptation.

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: FLIP is a transformer-based VAE with latent diffusion that generates fair and private tabular data without requiring predefined downstream tasks, using Rényi differential privacy and latent space alignment for fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and fairness concerns in synthetic data generation for sensitive domains like healthcare, as privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA) and AI responsibility frameworks (AI Act) impose increasing constraints on real-world data usage.

Method: Transformer-based variational autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion, employing Rényi differential privacy constraints during training, RDP-compatible balanced sampling for input space fairness, and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) for latent space fairness alignment across protected groups.

Result: FLIP effectively provides significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Conclusion: FLIP offers a comprehensive solution for generating heterogeneous tabular data that addresses both privacy and fairness concerns in a task-agnostic setup, making it broadly applicable for sensitive data domains.

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Motivation: Address the growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language processing by evaluating quantum text generation models against traditional architectures.

Method: Systematic experiments comparing five models (Transformer, QKSAN, QRWKV, QASA) across five diverse datasets using multiple metrics including perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency measures.

Result: Traditional Transformers maintain overall superiority with lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest BLEU-1 score (0.2895), but quantum models show competitive performance - QKSAN achieves 0.2800 BLEU-1 with zero repetition, QRWKV shows perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000).

Conclusion: While traditional models remain superior overall, quantum-inspired models demonstrate promising capabilities in specific text generation scenarios, particularly in avoiding repetition and maintaining vocabulary diversity.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation

measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest

Result: Successfully generated optimal quantum circuits with QFI of 1 for two-qubit systems using Rx, Ry, and S gates, demonstrating efficient automated circuit design.

Conclusion: Shows synergy between AI and quantum computation, enabling autonomous discovery of optimal quantum circuit designs for improved quantum sensing and estimation tasks.

Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits

computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for
learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection
mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current
state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions.
Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing
the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that
maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of
gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated
generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with
high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of
the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S

This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum
computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover

Result: Consistent improvements: QFI approaching 1, entanglement entropy 0.8-1.0 range, up to 90% reduction in circuit depth and gate count.

Conclusion: Combining quantum machine learning with tensor networks enables scalable optimization of complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.

Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic CV dataset to address the lack of diverse datasets for researching bias in algorithmic hiring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithmic hiring systems can introduce bias and discrimination, but existing research lacks datasets with diverse CV characteristics to properly study and mitigate these issues.

Method: The authors developed an approach to build a synthetic dataset of CVs modeled on real materials collected through a data donation campaign.

Result: They created a dataset of 1,730 synthetic CVs that reflect diverse candidate backgrounds and characteristics.

Conclusion: This synthetic CV dataset serves as a potential benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination and fairness evaluation.

Abstract: Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it
promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of
these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles,
which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown,
however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to
discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national
origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in
algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques
before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of
people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this
research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an
approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real
materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the
resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential
benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.

Result: Identified a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern radiating from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces, with government fiscal expenditure as the core determinant (3.9-4.9 unit livability increase per unit spending increase).

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable nationwide rural livability assessment and valuable insights for rural policy-making, with government investment being crucial for improving rural living environments.

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical

TL;DR: Miffie is an automated database normalization framework using LLMs with dual-model self-refinement architecture to generate and verify normalized schemas without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual database normalization is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring automated solutions to preserve data integrity efficiently.

Method: Uses dual-model self-refinement architecture combining generation and verification modules with task-specific zero-shot prompts for high accuracy and cost efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show Miffie can normalize complex database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Miffie successfully automates database normalization using LLMs with self-refinement architecture, achieving both accuracy and efficiency without human effort.

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Brazilian children use conversational agents for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment. Structured scaffolds (conversation-tree recipes) improve interaction quality compared to unstructured approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Brazilian children interact with conversational agents and develop effective scaffolding methods to enhance these interactions for educational and developmental purposes.

Method: Two studies: Study 1 used interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis with 23 participants over 7 weeks. Study 2 tested structured-prompting recipes on GPT-4o-mini using 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges.

Result: Identified three CA functions (School, Discovery, Entertainment) and developed recipe scaffolds. Quantitative evaluation showed structured-prompting improved readability, question quality, and coherence compared to unstructured baseline.

Conclusion: Scaffolded conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles, and caregiver-curated content are recommended. Contributions include first CWA application with Brazilian children, empirical framework of child-CA information flows, and effective LLM-scaffolding recipes.

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae is a UI agent that identifies decision points during web tasks and pauses for user input, improving task completion and preference matching for blind/low-vision users compared to baseline agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI agents perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices, reducing user agency. Field studies showed agents automatically choosing options without presenting alternatives, limiting user control over decisions.

Method: Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots, automatically identifies decision points during task execution, and pauses to prompt users for clarification when choices need to be made.

Result: In real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences compared to baseline agents including OpenAI Operator.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a mixed-initiative approach where users benefit from UI agent automation while maintaining the ability to express preferences, balancing efficiency with user agency.

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

TL;DR: Study of 20 AI-based computer perception tool developers reveals 4 key design priorities for clinical integration: context/explainability, workflow alignment, stakeholder customization, and innovation balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers balance clinical utility with user acceptability when integrating AI-based computer perception tools into clinical workflows.

Method: 20 in-depth interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools, transcribed and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.

Result: Identified 4 key design priorities: 1) context awareness and explainability, 2) workflow alignment, 3) stakeholder customization, 4) innovation within established paradigms. Developers see themselves as both technical architects and ethical stewards.

Conclusion: Successful integration requires documenting customization choices, defining customization limits, transparent output communication, and user training through interdisciplinary collaboration between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use
mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical
decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated
and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical
workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user
acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth
interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed
and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design
priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both
patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3)
appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and
acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with
established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves
as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools
that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing
objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following
suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around
customization are made, defining limits for customization choices,
transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user
training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration
between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

*Wenyong Zhou,Zhengwu Liu,Yuan Ren,Ngai Wong*

TL;DR: A novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on compute-in-memory accelerators that achieves better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIM accelerator approaches either sacrifice accuracy with binary quantization or achieve better accuracy with multi-bit quantization but limited hardware efficiency. There's a need for a method that balances both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Proposes BWMA with closed-form solutions for weight quantization to enhance binarized weight representation, and a differentiable function for activation quantization that approximates ideal multi-bit function without extensive search.

Result: Achieves accuracy improvements of 1.44%-5.46% on CIFAR-10 and 0.35%-5.37% on ImageNet over existing methods. Hardware simulations show 4-bit activation quantization provides optimal hardware cost-performance balance.

Conclusion: BWMA method successfully bridges the gap between hardware efficiency and model accuracy in CIM-based CNN accelerators, providing superior performance compared to previous quantization approaches.

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for
enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network
weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing
approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and
activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights
and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on
CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form
solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the
representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a
differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal
multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings.
Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show
that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods,
registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets.
Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation
quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model
performance.

### [188] [Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21086)
*Logan S. McCarty*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Quantum probability metrics (QPMs) are introduced as a new method to compare probability distributions by embedding them in quantum state space, overcoming limitations of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) in high-dimensional and non-compact domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MMD struggle with high-dimensional and non-compact probability distributions, creating a need for more robust comparison techniques.

Method: QPMs embed probability measures in the space of quantum states (positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space), extending kernel-based methods and providing enhanced sensitivity to distributional differences.

Result: QPMs offer improved performance over MMD, can be calculated using eigenvalue methods for empirical distributions, and provide analytic gradients suitable for learning and optimization, though they are computationally more intensive (O(n³) vs O(n²)).

Conclusion: QPMs provide a powerful foundation for analyzing and manipulating probability measures by combining quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, offering significant improvements as a drop-in replacement for MMD in tasks like generative modeling.

Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural,
social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here
we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding
probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace
operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods
and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an
integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly
approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high
dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using
eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and
optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes
($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a
drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling
task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with
classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful
tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A generative modeling framework using random weighted support points that produces diverse, interpretable samples from fixed datasets without neural networks or probabilistic assumptions, offering computational efficiency compared to GANs and DDPMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a compact yet informative representation of large datasets for data operations like Monte Carlo integration, and to develop a generative modeling alternative that doesn't require complex neural architectures or probabilistic assumptions.

Method: Random weighted support points with weighting inspired by Dirichlet process and Bayesian bootstrap, optimized using Convex-Concave Procedure (CCP) algorithm.

Result: Produces high-quality, diverse outputs on MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets at significantly lower computational cost than GANs and DDPMs, with genuinely interpolative samples that preserve data structure.

Conclusion: Random weighted support points offer a principled, scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling that is computationally efficient and preserves underlying data structure.

Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of
representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo
integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense,
support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original
data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based
on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting
scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The
proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed
dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural
network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and
develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave
Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show
that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of
the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These
results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled,
scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature
is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve
underlying data structure.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Adaptive bandwidth selection for MMD mixture kernel improves GMMN training, outperforming standard GMMNs and parametric copula models in high-dimensional applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the learning of copula random number generators by improving the training of generative moment matching networks through adaptive bandwidth selection and early stopping.

Method: Introduces adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for MMD mixture kernel in GMMNs, using relative error of training loss to increase kernel count and validation loss for early stopping.

Result: AGMMNs show significantly improved training performance over standard GMMNs with similar training time, demonstrated through validation MMD trajectories, samples, and values across high-dimensional applications.

Conclusion: Adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) provide superior performance over both standard GMMNs and parametric copula models, translating to improved model prediction in practical financial applications.

Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks
(GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random
number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training
loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the
relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion.
While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to
that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to
GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories,
samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as
typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three
applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random
samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of
interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second,
replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo
applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk
measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved
training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized
residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last,
both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to
demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison
to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to
an improved model prediction.

*Fabian Raisch,Max Langtry,Felix Koch,Ruchi Choudhary,Christoph Goebel,Benjamin Tischler*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper compares continual learning (CL) and transfer learning (TL) strategies for updating building thermal dynamics models over time, proposing a new Seasonal Memory Learning approach that significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of updating building thermal dynamics models as more operational data becomes available over time, particularly when building dynamics change due to retrofits or occupancy changes.

Method: Compared several CL and TL strategies plus models trained from scratch using 5-7 years of simulated data for single-family houses. Proposed Seasonal Memory Learning (SML) strategy.

Result: SML outperformed initial fine-tuning benchmark by 28.1% without concept drifts and 34.9% with concept drifts, while maintaining low computational effort.

Conclusion: Seasonal Memory Learning provides superior accuracy improvements over existing CL and TL methods for building thermal dynamics modeling, effectively handling concept drifts with low computational requirements.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling
building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a
pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it
remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational
measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more
complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit
or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning
(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can
also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step
and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to
incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and
address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building
thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a
model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building
operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data
representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios
with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL
strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements
than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort.
SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept
drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: DynaMark is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically adapts watermark covariance to detect replay attacks on industrial controllers, reducing energy consumption by 70% while maintaining detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industry 4.0 machine tool controllers are vulnerable to replay attacks using outdated sensor data. Current dynamic watermarking methods assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant statistics, making them ineffective for time-varying proprietary MTC behaviors.

Method: Models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP) using reinforcement learning. Learns adaptive policy online to dynamically adjust zero-mean Gaussian watermark covariance using measurements and detector feedback without system knowledge. Includes Bayesian belief updating for real-time detection confidence.

Result: On Siemens Sinumerik 828D controller digital twin: 70% reduction in watermark energy while preserving nominal trajectory compared to constant variance baselines. Maintains average detection delay equivalent to one sampling interval. Physical stepper-motor testbed validates rapid alarm triggering with less control performance decline.

Conclusion: DynaMark provides an effective adaptive watermarking solution for industrial controllers that doesn't require system knowledge, significantly reduces energy consumption while maintaining strong detection performance against replay attacks.

Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime
targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate
actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes
assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making
them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We
close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models
dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive
policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian
watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing
system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control
performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We
develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence
in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,
underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D
controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by
70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance
baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one
sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,
rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding
existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: Locus is a directed fuzzing framework that uses synthesized predicates as intermediate milestones to guide fuzzing towards target program states, achieving 41.6x average speedup over state-of-the-art fuzzers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed fuzzing faces challenges in reaching deeply nested target states due to large search spaces. Existing approaches rely on insufficient branch distances or manual constraints that are difficult to generalize across diverse programs and target states.

Method: Locus synthesizes predicates to capture semantically meaningful intermediate states as milestones toward target states. It uses an agentic framework with program analysis tools to iteratively refine candidate predicates, ensuring they strictly relax target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution.

Result: Locus substantially improves efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers with 41.6x average speedup. It discovered eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.

Conclusion: The Locus framework demonstrates that synthesized intermediate predicates effectively guide directed fuzzing, providing significant performance improvements and practical bug-finding capabilities across diverse programs and target states.

Abstract: Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target
program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes,
confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential
vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are
often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by
numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches
rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search;
however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize
progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified
constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to
generalize to diverse target states and programs.
  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed
fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing
progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones
towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under
fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while
providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to
diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis
tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while
ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false
rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus
substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in
discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x.
So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already
acknowledged with a draft patch.

*Guofu Liao,Taotao Wang,Shengli Zhang,Jiqun Zhang,Shi Long,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: zkLoRA is the first framework that combines LoRA fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs to enable secure and verifiable LLM fine-tuning while protecting model parameters and training data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is computationally demanding and raises security/privacy concerns in untrusted environments. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA lack security guarantees under zero-knowledge constraints.

Method: Uses cryptographic techniques (lookup arguments, sumcheck protocols, polynomial commitments) to verify arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer architectures. Provides end-to-end verifiability for forward/backward propagation and parameter updates.

Result: Successfully implemented and validated on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to 13 billion parameters. Demonstrates practicality and efficiency through GPU-based implementations.

Conclusion: zkLoRA bridges the gap between parameter-efficient fine-tuning and zero-knowledge proofs, enabling secure and trustworthy LLM deployment in sensitive environments.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting them to
specific tasks, yet it remains computationally demanding and raises concerns
about correctness and privacy, particularly in untrusted environments. Although
parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly
reduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of
fine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge.
To address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA
fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and
correctness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup
arguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both
arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures.
The framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation,
backward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while
safeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging
GPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency
through experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to
13 billion parameters. By combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with ZKPs,
zkLoRA bridges a critical gap, enabling secure and trustworthy deployment of
LLMs in sensitive or untrusted environments.

*Daryna Oliynyk,Rudolf Mayer,Kathrin Grosse,Andreas Rauber*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper provides the first standardized methodology for evaluating model stealing attacks against machine learning models, focusing on image classification models and offering comprehensive recommendations for attack design and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model stealing attacks threaten ML model confidentiality, but current research lacks standardized evaluation methods, making it difficult to compare attacks and assess progress in the field.

Method: The authors study existing model stealing attacks on image classification models, develop a comprehensive threat model, create a framework for attack comparison, and analyze attack setups from related works to identify best practices.

Result: The paper presents standardized recommendations for attack development before, during, and after experiments, and identifies open research questions for evaluating model stealing attacks.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing attacks that can be applied across different problem domains, providing much-needed standardization in the field.

Abstract: Model stealing attacks endanger the confidentiality of machine learning
models offered as a service. Although these models are kept secret, a malicious
party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute
model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are
continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised,
making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field.
This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for
designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the
largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those
attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive
threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse
attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been
studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack
development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list
of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks.
Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence
establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing
attacks.

*Jiazheng Xing,Hai Ci,Hongbin Xu,Hangjie Yuan,Yong Liu,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OptMark is an optimization-based multi-bit watermarking method for diffusion-generated images that embeds robust watermarks in intermediate latents using structural and detail components with adjoint gradient methods for memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion watermarking methods have limitations - zero-bit systems lack capacity for large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are sensitive to image transformations and generative attacks, lacking comprehensive robustness.

Method: Embeds multi-bit watermark into intermediate latents of diffusion denoising process using structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and detail watermark late to withstand transformations, with tailored regularization terms and adjoint gradient methods to reduce memory usage from O(N) to O(1).

Result: Achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking with robust resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations, editing, and regeneration attacks.

Conclusion: OptMark provides a comprehensive solution for robust multi-bit watermarking in diffusion-generated images, addressing both capacity limitations of zero-bit systems and robustness issues of existing multi-bit methods.

Abstract: Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection
and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face
significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for
large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to
certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of
comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an
optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the
intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically
inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail
watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization
terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the
challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising
steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods,
reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that
OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust
resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations,
editing, and regeneration attacks.

### [198] [Considerations for Estimating Causal Effects of Informatively Timed Treatments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21804)
*Arman Oganisian*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Paper addresses informative timing in sequential treatment effects on survival outcomes, showing how g-methods can adjust for waiting times as time-varying confounders to avoid bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemiological studies often ignore that treatment timing varies across subjects and may be informative of subsequent decisions and outcomes, creating potential bias in causal effect estimation.

Method: Uses g-methods to analyze sequentially timed treatments, treating waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders. Demonstrates with synthetic examples and provides implementation guidance with software.

Result: Shows that ignoring informative timing leads to biased estimates, while g-methods that adjust for waiting times between treatments provide valid causal inference even with death or censoring between treatments.

Conclusion: Considering treatment timing is crucial for valid inference, and g-methods that adjust for waiting times as time-varying confounders can correct for informative timing in sequential treatment scenarios.

Abstract: Epidemiological studies are often concerned with estimating causal effects of
a sequence of treatment decisions on survival outcomes. In many settings,
treatment decisions do not occur at fixed, pre-specified followup times.
Rather, timing varies across subjects in ways that may be informative of
subsequent treatment decisions and potential outcomes. Awareness of the issue
and its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this
work. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated
with ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential
treatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the
waiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as
a time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how
g-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how
adjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in
between treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification
with discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide
implementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our
concluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid
inference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods
that adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders.

TL;DR: Using RAG-enhanced LLMs for model-to-code transformation in quantum software systems, showing 4x CodeBLEU improvement with well-engineered prompts for Qiskit code generation from UML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costs and mitigate risks in quantum software development by addressing heterogeneous platforms and developer skill gaps through model-driven approaches.

Method: Deployed RAG pipeline incorporating sample Qiskit code from GitHub repositories to enhance LLMs for generating quantum code from UML model instances.

Result: Experimental results show well-engineered prompts can improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and consistent quantum code.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for quantum code generation and can be extended to other research directions like using software models as RAG sources and code-to-code transformations for transpilation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

*Dongjun Lee,Changho Hwang,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UTRL is a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to generate high-quality unit tests through adversarial training between a test generator and code generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating unit test generation is challenging, and current methods for training LLMs to produce comprehensive tests remain underexplored despite their potential to improve software testing.

Method: Adversarial reinforcement learning framework with two LLMs: a unit test generator trained to maximize discrimination reward (exposing faults), and a code generator trained to maximize code reward (passing tests).

Result: Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL generates higher quality unit tests than supervised fine-tuning on human-written tests, and outperforms GPT-4.1 in test quality.

Conclusion: UTRL effectively trains LLMs to generate high-quality unit tests through adversarial reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior performance over both supervised learning and frontier models.

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models
(LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have
been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

*Tobias Lindenbauer,Igor Slinko,Ludwig Felder,Egor Bogomolov,Yaroslav Zharov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Simple observation-masking strategy outperforms complex LLM summarization in SWE-agent context management, achieving similar solve rates at half the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents generate long, expensive context histories during complex problem-solving. While current SE agents use LLM summarization to manage this, it's unclear if this complexity provides real benefits over simpler approaches like omitting older observations.

Method: Systematic comparison of context management strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations, testing raw agent vs. LLM summarization vs. simple observation-masking.

Result: Observation-masking halves cost relative to raw agent while matching or slightly exceeding LLM summarization solve rates. For Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improved solve rate from 53.8% to 54.8% while remaining cost-effective.

Conclusion: The simplest context management approach (observation-masking) proves most effective and efficient for SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, suggesting complexity doesn't always yield better performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems, finding that recommendations highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no established scientific understanding of the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems, as prior work used different evaluation measures for each type, preventing proper comparison.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures that can be used for both fairness types, running experiments with 8 runs across 3 datasets.

Result: Experiments show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals, revealing a novel tension between these two fairness types.

Conclusion: This finding is useful for recommender system practitioners aiming to improve fairness, as it highlights the need to consider both group and individual fairness simultaneously rather than optimizing for one type alone.

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

Motivation: Address the cold-user problem in recommender systems where new users have limited interaction history, while maintaining privacy by avoiding sensitive demographic data.

Method: Proposes reinforcement learning approach combining Double and Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DQN) variants with matrix factorization model to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse feedback.

Result: Superior performance on large e-commerce dataset compared to traditional methods; Dueling DQN particularly effective at reducing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective privacy-constrained solution for cold-user recommendation problems, with Dueling DQN showing the best performance.

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse
feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive
demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce

Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes Diff-MSIN framework for multi-modal CTR prediction using diffusion-based synergy modeling with three modules for feature enhancement, relationship capture, and adaptive fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTR prediction methods mainly use ID modality and cannot comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Direct application of multi-modal fusion methods fails to disentangle commonalities/specificities and consider synergistic effects between modalities.

Method: Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) with three modules: Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE), Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC), and Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF). Uses Knowledge Decoupling method to encourage feature distinctiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments on Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets show significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The Diff-MSIN framework effectively enhances multi-modal representation quality and fusion, demonstrating strong potential for improving multi-modal recommendation systems.

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

*Kevin Putra Santoso,Rizka Wakhidatus Sholikah,Raden Venantius Hari Ginardi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WaveLLDM introduces a lightweight latent diffusion model for audio restoration that operates in compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity while maintaining decent reconstruction quality, though it underperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality audio is essential but degradation from noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains challenging. Existing diffusion models require significant computational resources and struggle with longer missing segments.

Method: WaveLLDM integrates an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration, processing audio in compressed latent space instead of time or spectral domains to reduce computational complexity.

Result: Achieves accurate spectral reconstruction with low LSD scores (0.48-0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data, but underperforms in perceptual quality (WB-PESQ: 1.62-1.71) and speech clarity (STOI: 0.76-0.78) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: While current implementation has limitations due to suboptimal tuning and insufficient training, the flexible architecture combining neural audio codec and latent diffusion provides a strong foundation for future development in efficient audio restoration.

Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including
online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,
degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a
major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio
restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and
struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM
(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an
efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and
denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral
domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing
computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical
evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves
accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores
(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still
underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual
quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and
STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to
suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient
training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a
neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for
future development.

*Aditya Makineni,Baocheng Geng,Qing Tian*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FFTP patching strategy preserves spectrogram frequency patterns and reduces computation, while SpecMask augmentation improves robustness. Combined approach boosts audio classification performance with significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio models use square patching from computer vision, which disrupts frequency patterns and creates too many patches, slowing training and increasing computation costs.

Method: Proposes Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP) that spans full frequency bands with localized temporal context, and SpecMask augmentation that combines full-frequency and time-frequency masks under fixed budget.

Result: Improves mAP by up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2, while reducing computation by up to 83.26% when applied to AST and AuM models.

Conclusion: FFTP with SpecMask provides both performance improvements and computational efficiency for audio spectrogram modeling by better matching time-frequency asymmetry and preserving harmonic structure.

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification
by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such
as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square
patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and
produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing
computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching
strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by
spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving
harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We
also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines
full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,
enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When
applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by
up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,
while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and
efficiency gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of remote monitoring for dementia patients who live alone, including privacy concerns, activity recognition limitations, and the need for large labeled datasets in real-home deployments.

Method: Uses structural vibration sensors to monitor human activities unobtrusively. Adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to pretrain models, then fine-tunes with very limited real-world data for robust activity recognition.

Result: Developed a framework that reduces the need for substantial labeled data while maintaining accurate activity recognition capabilities in real-home environments.

Conclusion: The proposed scalable solution enables effective daily routine tracking for remote dementia caregiving by overcoming data limitations through synthesized data pretraining and minimal fine-tuning.

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on
caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote
monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain
including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model
generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor
systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor
human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in
controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities.
However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a
substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our
scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to
pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to
create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.

Motivation: Existing pooling methods operate at single granularity (either global or frame-level), missing complementary perceptual insights for speech quality assessment.

Method: Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling (DRASP) integrates coarse-grained global statistical summaries with fine-grained attentive analysis of perceptually significant segments.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval, AES-Natural), MOS prediction backbones, and audio generation systems with 10.39% relative improvement in SRCC.

Conclusion: DRASP provides more thorough and robust representation by capturing both structural context and local details, demonstrating strong generalization ability for MOS prediction.

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction,
facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a
concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality.
Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity,
concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed
frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics
Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global
statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually
significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to
formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the
overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization
ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline
methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction
backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different
audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in
system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the
widely-used average pooling approach.

*Thomas Besnier,Sylvain Arguillère,Mohamed Daoudi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A rig-free data-driven framework for motion prediction and transfer on unregistered body meshes using motion embedding and per-vertex feature fields to generate spatio-temporal deformation fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unregistered surface meshes and raw 3D scans lack point-wise correspondences and contain noise, making automatic computation of plausible deformations challenging.

Method: Couples a robust motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a spatio-temporal deformation field that drives mesh deformation.

Result: Extensive evaluations including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals demonstrate effectiveness on tasks like walking and running on challenging unregistered meshes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and versatile for motion prediction and transfer on unregistered body meshes without requiring rigging.

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

### [210] [ARGS: Advanced Regularization on Aligning Gaussians over the Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21344)
*Jeong Uk Lee,Sung Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Improved 3D mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussian Splatting using two regularization strategies: effective rank regularization for better Gaussian shapes and neural SDF integration for surface coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS models like SuGaR have limitations in visual fidelity and scene consistency, needing better regularization for individual Gaussian shapes and overall surface coherence.

Method: Two complementary strategies: 1) Effective rank regularization to prevent extreme anisotropy and favor disk-like Gaussian shapes, 2) Neural SDF integration with Eikonal loss for continuous global surface prior and better geometric alignment.

Result: The model produces more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data with improved fidelity of individual primitives and collective surface behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization strategies successfully address common limitations in 3DGS reconstruction, enhancing both visual quality and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

*Anna Geißler,Luca-Sophie Bien,Friedrich Schöppler,Tobias Hertel*

Main category: physics.ed-ph

TL;DR: Current LLMs fail to meet the 95% competence threshold for unsupervised thermodynamics tutoring, achieving only 82% accuracy with significant gaps in irreversible scenarios and visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if LLMs are ready for unsupervised use as tutoring aids in undergraduate science education, particularly in thermodynamics which requires consistent, principle-grounded reasoning.

Method: Created UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics benchmark covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and diagram interpretation, testing leading 2025-era LLMs.

Result: No LLM exceeded 95% competence threshold (best achieved 82%). Text-only items performed better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance levels. Performance gaps concentrated in finite-rate/irreversible scenarios and visual feature binding.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in thermodynamics due to significant reasoning gaps, particularly in irreversible processes and visual interpretation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in
science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate
instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent
recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics,
with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions,
reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such
capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics
question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and
diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence
threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items
performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance
levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little
correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible
scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating
that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this
domain.

TL;DR: Deep active learning with Bayesian Neural Network approximation and weighted loss reduces labeled data needs for COVID-19 lung severity classification from chest X-rays while handling class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity classification from chest X-rays under class imbalance conditions, particularly for COVID-19 diagnosis.

Method: Used deep active learning with Bayesian Neural Network approximation (Monte Carlo Dropout) and weighted loss function. Applied various acquisition functions to iteratively select informative samples from unlabeled pool. Trained on 2,319 CXRs from COVID-19 patients labeled by radiologists.

Result: Entropy Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC 0.91) in binary classification using only 15.4% of training data. Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC 0.86) in multi-class setting using 23.1% of labeled data. Outperformed more complex acquisition functions.

Conclusion: Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss effectively reduces labeling requirements while maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance, addressing class imbalance in medical image analysis.

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

*Natalia L. Rubio,Eric F. Darve,Alison L. Marsden*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: Machine learning-enhanced 0D hemodynamic model improves accuracy at vessel bifurcations while maintaining computational efficiency for cardiovascular flow simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D finite-element simulations are computationally expensive for clinical use, while standard reduced-order models lack accuracy at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics occur.

Method: Developed a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model using neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating non-dimensionalization and flow split prediction, integrated into 0D models via optimization-based solution.

Result: Substantial accuracy improvements: RRI method reduced inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) to 25 mmHg (17%) compared to standard 0D models, with particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks.

Conclusion: The hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling suitable for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows
provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their
high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models
(ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced
accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are
inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an
enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted
bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a
resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict
pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and
quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs
non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow
split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the
RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We
validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across
Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D
finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy
improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method
reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25
mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg
(26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high
Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical
approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision
support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular
biomedical engineering.

*Haozhe Tian,Qiyu Rao,Nina Moutonnet,Pietro Ferraro,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes Sequential Matched Filter (SMF) using Reinforcement Learning to design adaptive filter sequences for better pattern localization in low SNR signals like ear-ECG, maintaining interpretability while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional matched filters deteriorate in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments like edge devices, where noise patterns can resemble target signals, particularly problematic in applications like ear-ECG where cardiac signals are attenuated and corrupted.

Method: Replaces single matched filter with a sequence of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent, formulating filter design as a sequential decision-making process to create signal-specific filter sequences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets, demonstrating strong potential for reliable clinical decision support.

Conclusion: The SMF framework provides accurate pattern localization from noise-corrupted signals while remaining fully interpretable, with broad applicability beyond ECG to various applications requiring robust signal pattern detection.

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

*Shawnak Shivakumar,Matthew Sandora*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: ImmunoAI is a machine learning framework that accelerates antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using gradient-boosted models trained on structural and physicochemical features, reducing search space by 89% and enabling rapid response to viral outbreaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional antibody discovery pipelines take 10-12 months, which is too slow for rapid outbreak response to viruses like human metapneumovirus (hMPV) that pose serious risks to vulnerable populations.

Method: A LightGBM regressor was trained on 213 antibody-antigen complexes to extract geometric and physicochemical features and predict binding affinity. The model was fine-tuned on 117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs and used AlphaFold2 to predict 3D structures when experimental data was unavailable.

Result: The model reduced antibody candidate search space by 89% and improved RMSE from 1.70 to 0.92 after fine-tuning. It identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting key hMPV mutation sites (G42V and E96K).

Conclusion: ImmunoAI significantly shortens antibody design cycles and enables faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks by accelerating the discovery of high-affinity antibody candidates.

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and
immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require
10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This
project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates
antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using
gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D
topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes
was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM
regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The
model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on
117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2
variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model
identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting
key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for
experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables
faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.

TL;DR: Review of automated methods for inferring digital twins from biological time series, comparing symbolic vs sparse regression approaches and highlighting emerging deep learning methods with proposed benchmarking framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for automated approaches to create digital twins from biological data due to limitations of manual data integration, inspired by success in Physics but addressing unique biological challenges.

Method: Reviewed methodologies including symbolic regression and sparse regression, evaluated against 8 biological/methodological challenges (noisy data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge, latent variables, dimensionality, unobserved derivatives, library design, uncertainty quantification).

Result: Sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, especially with Bayesian frameworks. Deep learning and LLMs show promise for prior knowledge integration but need reliability improvements.

Conclusion: Progress will come from hybrid frameworks combining mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and deep learning capabilities, supported by proposed benchmarking framework.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of
high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital
twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key
reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug
discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on
laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches
are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,
rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest
in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.
Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from
biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We
evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological
challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior
knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved
variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.
Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic
regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight
the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable
innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency
of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all
challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from
hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based
mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative
and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their
development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods
across all challenges.

Motivation: To enable transparent analysis of LLM reasoning in economic forecasting and provide tools to correct or simulate biases for social science research.

Method: Brain scanning technique that identifies plain-English concepts guiding LLM reasoning, maps forecasts to concepts like sentiment and technical analysis, and allows steering models while holding other factors constant.

Result: Successfully mapped LLM-generated economic forecasts to specific concepts, computed their relative importance, and demonstrated ability to steer models to be more/less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic without reducing performance.

Conclusion: The method provides a transparent, lightweight, and replicable approach for empirical social science research to understand and control LLM reasoning in economic contexts.

Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan"
large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide
their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show
that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as

importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be
steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which
allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To guide players toward specific action profiles in normal-form games using mediator-based steering through information and incentive design, addressing limitations of pure information design approaches.

Method: Characterizes games where steering is possible, establishes limitations of information design alone, derives payment lower bounds, and introduces a one-shot information design phase that transforms the interaction into a Stackelberg game before repeated play.

Result: Shows steering to desired profiles isn't always achievable with information design alone or sublinear payments. The augmented approach improves convergence rate by a constant factor with high probability, supported by empirical results.

Conclusion: The proposed one-shot information design approach effectively addresses limitations of traditional information design methods, providing better steering performance and faster convergence to target action profiles in mediator-augmented games.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented
two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a
specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first
characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we
establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always
achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear
payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments
required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred
with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a
one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,
transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we
theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of
players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high
probability, and support it with empirical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DePIN markets have grown rapidly (exceeding $10B market cap) but face risks from unregulated operations and AI agent misalignment with human values, requiring better analysis and governance frameworks.

Method: Developed EconAgentic framework with three focus areas: modeling DePIN market dynamics, evaluating stakeholder actions/economic impacts, and analyzing macroeconomic indicators. Simulated AI agent responses to token incentives, infrastructure investments, and market conditions compared to human benchmarks.

Result: EconAgentic provides valuable insights into DePIN market efficiency, inclusion, and stability, demonstrating how AI agents can be better aligned with human values and market goals.

Conclusion: The framework contributes to both academic understanding and practical improvements in designing and governing decentralized, tokenized economies by addressing risks and misalignments in AI-driven DePIN markets.

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both
academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance
of decentralized, tokenized economies.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SSL pre-trained models like Wav2Vec2 significantly improve children's speech recognition in zero-shot scenarios, with Layer 22 of Wav2Vec2 achieving 51.64% relative WER reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with children's speech due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics, while SSL models have shown success with adult speech but remain underutilized for children's speech.

Method: Analyzed layer-wise features from SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, WavLM) integrated into DNN-based ASR system using Kaldi toolkit. Used WSJCAM0 adult speech for training and PFSTAR children speech for testing in zero-shot scenario.

Result: Wav2Vec2 Layer 22 achieved lowest WER of 5.15% (51.64% relative improvement over baseline WER of 10.65%). Performance improvements consistent across age groups, with significant gains even in younger children. Similar trends confirmed on CMU Kids dataset.

Conclusion: SSL pre-trained models, particularly Wav2Vec2, are highly effective for children's speech recognition in zero-shot scenarios, with specific layers (Layer 22) providing optimal performance and generalizable across different datasets.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

Motivation: Children's speech presents unique acoustic and linguistic challenges for KWS systems that are not adequately addressed by methods developed for adult speech.

Method: Layer-wise feature extraction from SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec) used to train Kaldi-based DNN KWS system, trained on adult speech (WSJCAM0) and tested on children's speech (PFSTAR) for zero-shot evaluation.

Result: Achieved SOTA results across all keyword sets: Wav2Vec2 layer 22 performed best with 0.691 ATWV, 0.7003 MTWV, 0.0164 PFA, and 0.0547 Pmiss for 30 keywords. System showed effectiveness across different age groups and robustness in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: SSL features significantly enhance zero-shot KWS performance for children's speech, effectively addressing the distinct characteristics of child speakers and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in

due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

### [222] [Population-Scale Network Embeddings Expose Educational Divides in Network Structure Related to Right-Wing Populist Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21236)
*Malte Lüken,Javier Garcia-Bernardo,Sreeparna Deb,Flavio Hafner,Megha Khosla*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Using Dutch administrative data, researchers created network embeddings from shared social contexts and found one interpretable dimension linked to right-wing populist voting, particularly through school network structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage administrative registry data to construct population-scale networks and use machine learning embeddings to understand how network positions relate to political voting behavior, specifically right-wing populist voting.

Method: Created embeddings for all Dutch persons from a network representing five shared contexts (neighborhood, work, family, household, school), then used these embeddings to predict right-wing populist voting and transformed embeddings for interpretability.

Result: Embeddings alone predicted voting above chance but worse than individual characteristics. After transformation, one embedding dimension was strongly associated with the outcome, revealing network structure differences related to education levels and school ties.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how to make population-scale network embeddings interpretable and links structural network differences in education to right-wing populist voting, providing both methodological and substantive contributions.

Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale
networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With
machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations
-- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the
network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a
population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood,
work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these
embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings
alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed
worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings
with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. However,
after transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and
orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with
the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed
differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between
different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes
methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can
be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network
differences in education to right-wing populist voting.

### [223] [Faster Inference of Cell Complexes from Flows via Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21372)
*Til Spreuer,Josef Hoppe,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: A novel matrix-factorization-based heuristic for lifting graph edge-flow signals to cell complexes to achieve sparse representation via Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors, offering computational efficiency improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find sparse, interpretable representations of observed edge-flow signals on graphs by lifting them to cell complexes, addressing the NP-hard nature of the general problem with a more efficient solution.

Method: Developed a matrix-factorization-based heuristic that augments the observed graph with 2-cells (polygons) to create a cell complex, using the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian for sparse representation of edge flows.

Result: The approach is significantly less computationally expensive than prior heuristics while achieving comparable performance, and outperforms previous methods in noisy settings in both solution quality and speed.

Conclusion: The proposed matrix-factorization-based heuristic provides an efficient and effective solution for the graph lifting problem, particularly beneficial in noisy environments where it surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals
observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed
edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and
curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed
graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting
paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated
cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed
edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is
NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based
heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate
that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than
prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most
settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new
approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and
computational speed.

*Allen Wang,Gavin Tao*

TL;DR: QuadKAN uses spline-parameterized KANs for vision-guided quadruped control, combining proprioception and vision with structured function classes to improve robustness, efficiency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for combining proprioception with vision for robust quadruped motion control, recognizing that current methods may lack efficiency and suffer from action jitter.

Method: Proposes QuadKAN framework with spline-encoder for proprioception, spline fusion head for cross-modal inputs, using KANs and trained with PPO and Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR).

Result: Achieves higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions across diverse terrains compared to SOTA baselines, with reduced energy consumption and action jitter.

Conclusion: Spline-parameterized policies provide a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion in quadruped robots.

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: EO-Robotics introduces EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset for unified embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language-action models fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction, despite progress in general robot control.

Method: Developed EO-1 unified architecture processing multimodal inputs indiscriminately, trained on EO-Data1.5M (1.5M samples) using auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising.

Result: Superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control, validated through long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments.

Conclusion: Interleaved vision-text-action learning enables seamless open-world understanding and generalization, offering valuable insights for advanced embodied foundation models.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D CNN approach shows effectiveness for MAC autonomous driving, highlighting how model architecture and environmental complexity impact performance and generalization in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

*Usman A. Khan,Mouhacine Benosman,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Joseph W. Durham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel multi-robot path planning method using optimal transport theory and MPC to ensure non-overlapping trajectories while minimizing navigation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches that map robots to targets first and then plan paths can result in overlapping paths leading to deadlocks in multi-robot navigation systems.

Method: Discretize space into cells with cost structure, apply optimal transport theory for optimal non-overlapping cell transitions, and integrate temporal structure with replans and model predictive control for dynamic constraints.

Result: Method provides guaranteed non-overlapping trajectories with computational complexity of O(K³logK) worst-case and O(K²logK) for well-behaved problems.

Conclusion: Optimal transport combined with MPC offers an effective solution for multi-robot navigation that prevents deadlocks while accommodating unavoidable trajectory overlaps and robot dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboInspector is a pipeline that identifies and characterizes unreliability in LLM-generated policy code for robotic manipulation, addressing issues from task complexity and instruction granularity, and provides a refinement approach that improves reliability by up to 35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' capabilities in reasoning and code generation for robotic manipulation, achieving reliable policy code remains challenging due to diverse real-world task requirements and varying user instructions that can cause unreliability.

Method: The authors design RoboInspector to analyze unreliability from two perspectives: manipulation task complexity and instruction granularity. They conduct comprehensive experiments with 168 combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs across two frameworks, identifying four main unreliable behaviors leading to manipulation failure.

Result: RoboInspector successfully identifies four main unreliable behaviors causing manipulation failure and provides detailed characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes. The refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback improves reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for reducing unreliability in LLM-enabled robotic manipulation and demonstrates that targeted refinement approaches can significantly improve the reliability of policy code generation for robotic systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

*Ardavan Mehdizadeh,Peter Schindler*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Systematic benchmark reveals that training data composition, not architectural complexity, is the key factor for accurate cleavage energy prediction in universal machine learning interatomic potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No systematic evaluation existed for how well universal MLIPs predict cleavage energies, a critical property for fracture, catalysis, and surface phenomena, despite their success in bulk property prediction.

Method: Comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs using a DFT database of 36,718 slab structures across elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds, evaluating performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations.

Result: Models trained on OMat24 dataset (non-equilibrium configurations) achieved <6% mean absolute percentage errors and correctly identified most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases without explicit training. Equilibrium-only trained models showed 5x higher errors, while surface-adsorbate trained models failed catastrophically with 17x degradation. Simpler architectures with appropriate data matched complex transformers' accuracy with 10-100x speedup.

Conclusion: Training data generation strategy that captures relevant physical phenomena is more critical than architectural sophistication for accurate cleavage energy prediction in MLIPs.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized
computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical
accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented
exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their
remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has
assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,
a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and
interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19
state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously
established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures
spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse
architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical
compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results
reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication:
models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes
non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below
6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface
terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In
contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets
show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data
fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler
architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to
complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These
findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data
generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.

TL;DR: Proposes NSPDI-SNN, a spiking neural network method inspired by biological dendrites that achieves high sparsity with minimal performance loss through nonlinear dendritic integration and pruning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological neurons have complex dendritic structures with efficient information processing capabilities that are rarely matched in current SNNs. The authors aim to leverage the nonlinear structure and sparse properties of neuronal dendrites to create more efficient SNNs.

Method: Introduces nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve spatiotemporal information representation, implements heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines, and constructs a flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve high sparsity.

Result: Achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation across multiple benchmarks (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, CIFAR10) and complex tasks (speech recognition, reinforcement learning). Obtained best results on all three event stream datasets and showed improved synaptic information transfer efficiency as sparsity increased.

Conclusion: The complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods, demonstrating that biological inspiration can lead to significant improvements in artificial neural network efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on
simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent
artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons
have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however,
the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites.
Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal
dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with
nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we
introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation
of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state
transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible
nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We
conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture,
CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks
(speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task).
Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal
performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best
experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis
showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information
transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the
complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a
promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Pep2Prob is the first comprehensive dataset and benchmark for peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction in mass spectrometry proteomics, showing that peptide-specific models outperform traditional global statistics approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MS2 proteomics methods use oversimplified global fragmentation statistics that assume uniform fragment probabilities across all peptides, limiting accurate peptide identification from mass spectra.

Method: Created Pep2Prob dataset with fragment ion probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors from 183M+ high-quality HCD MS2 spectra. Established baselines using statistical rules and learning-based methods to compare peptide-specific vs global approaches.

Result: Models using peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous methods relying only on global fragmentation statistics. Performance scales with model capacity, indicating complex nonlinear peptide-fragmentation relationships.

Conclusion: Peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction requires sophisticated machine learning approaches and provides substantial improvements over traditional global statistics methods for accurate peptide identification in proteomics.

Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug
targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in
health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical
technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting
them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in
biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability
prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide
identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.
Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes
that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,
this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view
and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the
first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific
fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion
probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair
of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million
high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide
assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance
using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models
leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous
methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance
across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the
peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring
sophisticated machine learning approaches.

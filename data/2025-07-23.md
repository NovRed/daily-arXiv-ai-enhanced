### [1] [Salience Adjustment for Context-Based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15878)
*Bin Han,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a salience-adjusted framework that combines Bayesian Cue Integration and Visual-Language Models to improve emotion recognition by dynamically weighting facial expressions and contextual information based on facial cue expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts is challenging because it requires understanding complex interactions between facial expressions and situational cues. Current approaches may not adequately balance these different sources of information.

Method: The authors develop a salience-adjusted framework that integrates Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the expressivity of facial cues.

Result: The salience adjustment approach enhances emotion recognition performance when evaluated using human annotations and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios designed to evoke emotional reactions.

Conclusion: Incorporating salience adjustment improves emotion recognition performance and offers promising directions for extending this framework to broader social contexts and multimodal applications in future research.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts requires an understanding of
the complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. This
paper presents a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion
recognition with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models
(VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the
expressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations
and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios,
which are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that
incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,
offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to
broader social contexts and multimodal applications.

Motivation: The processing of long documents by multimodal Large Language Models remains under-explored due to a lack of suitable benchmarks, despite significant advances in analyzing complex multimodal data inputs.

Method: The researchers created Document Haystack benchmark featuring documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages with strategically inserted pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various depths to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities, supported by an objective automated evaluation framework.

Result: The benchmark comprises 400 document variants and 8,250 questions total. Results from prominent VLMs are presented, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Document Haystack provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for testing VLMs on long document processing and opens up potential research avenues in this under-explored area of multimodal AI.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly
advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from
different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains
under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this,
we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex
documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and
strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various
depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities.
Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is
supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the
construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present
results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this
area.

### [3] [PAT++: a cautionary tale about generative visual augmentation for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15888)
*Leonardo Santiago Benitez Pereira,Arathy Jeevan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using generative data augmentation for object re-identification and finds that generated images consistently hurt performance due to domain shifts and loss of identity-defining features, challenging assumptions about generative models in fine-grained recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object re-identification requires preserving fine-grained visual details for accurate identity matching, but the effectiveness of generative data augmentation in this domain remains largely unexplored, despite showing gains in other vision tasks.

Method: The authors propose PAT++, a novel pipeline that incorporates Diffusion Self-Distillation into the Part-Aware Transformer architecture, and conduct extensive experiments using generated images for both model training and query expansion on the Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset.

Result: The experiments show consistent performance degradation when using generated images, attributed to domain shifts between real and synthetic data and the failure of generative models to retain critical identity-defining features necessary for accurate re-identification.

Conclusion: The findings challenge common assumptions about the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and reveal significant limitations in current visual augmentation approaches for identity-preserving applications, suggesting that generative data augmentation may not be suitable for object re-identification tasks.

Abstract: Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.

### [4] [Local Dense Logit Relations for Enhanced Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15911)
*Liuchi Xu,Kang Liu,Jinshuai Liu,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a knowledge distillation method that captures fine-grained inter-class relationships through recursive logit decoupling and recombining, enhanced with an Adaptive Decay Weight strategy for improved student model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logit distillation methods lack thorough exploration of fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge, missing opportunities to provide more detailed and clearer insights for student learning through better understanding of inter-class relationships.

Method: The method introduces LDRLD which recursively decouples and recombines logit information to capture inter-class relationships, combined with an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and Exponential Rank Decay (ERD) to dynamically adjust weights for critical category pairs, plus distillation of remaining non-target knowledge for completeness.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably with state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches, showing improved student model performance through fine-grained knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed LDRLD method successfully improves knowledge distillation by focusing on fine-grained inter-class relationships and critical category pairs, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing logit-based distillation methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.

### [5] [An empirical study for the early detection of Mpox from skin lesion images using pretrained CNN models leveraging XAI technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15915)
*Mohammad Asifur Rahim,Muhammad Nazmul Arefin,Md. Mizanur Rahman,Md Ali Hossain,Ahmed Moustafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for early mpox detection using transfer learning and Grad-CAM explainability, achieving up to 95% accuracy on binary classification and 93% on multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mpox is a zoonotic disease that shares similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis challenging. While AI and deep learning show promise for medical image analysis, pre-trained CNN models and explainable AI (XAI) techniques for mpox detection remain underexplored.

Method: The study used transfer learning with four pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) on two datasets (MSLD and MSLD v2.0). Initial layers were frozen and custom layers were added for mpox-specific feature adaptation. Grad-CAM was implemented as an XAI technique to visualize critical image regions and enhance model interpretability.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved the best performance on binary classification with 95% accuracy, while MobileNetV2 performed best on multi-class classification with 93% accuracy. Grad-CAM successfully highlighted key image regions for interpretability. However, some models showed overfitting tendencies with discrepancies between training and validation losses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of pre-trained CNN models for monkeypox detection and validates the value of XAI techniques like Grad-CAM. Future research should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data, and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic reliability and model transparency.

Abstract: Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis
challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a
strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs
and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study
aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.
Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,
and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic
reliability and model transparency

### [6] [A Lightweight Face Quality Assessment Framework to Improve Face Verification Performance in Real-Time Screening Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15961)
*Ahmed Aman Ibrahim,Hamad Mansour Alawar,Abdulnasser Abbas Zehi,Ahmed Mohammad Alkendi,Bilal Shafi Ashfaq Ahmed Mirza,Shan Ullah,Ismail Lujain Jaleel,Hassan Ugail*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight face quality assessment framework using normalized facial landmarks and Random Forest Regression achieves 96.67% accuracy in filtering low-quality face images, resulting in 99.7% reduction in false rejection rates when integrated with ArcFace verification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face verification systems suffer from significantly degraded performance when processing low-quality images caused by motion blur, poor lighting, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, leading to higher false rejection and acceptance rates in real-time screening applications like surveillance and access control.

Method: The framework employs normalized facial landmarks combined with a Random Forest Regression classifier to automatically assess face image quality and pre-filter low-quality images before they enter the verification pipeline.

Result: Achieved 96.67% accuracy in quality assessment, 99.7% reduction in false rejection rate, enhanced cosine similarity scores with ArcFace model, and superior performance compared to existing face quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency on a real-world dataset of 600+ subjects from Dubai Police CCTV footage.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight framework effectively addresses critical challenges in real-time face verification by mitigating the impact of poor-quality images, particularly handling variations in face resolution and pose deviations common in practical surveillance scenarios, while outperforming existing methods with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

### [7] [FW-VTON: Flattening-and-Warping for Person-to-Person Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16010)
*Zheng Wang,Xianbing Sun,Shengyi Wu,Jiahui Zhan,Jianlou Si,Chi Zhang,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FW-VTON, a novel three-stage method for person-to-person virtual try-on that extracts, warps, and integrates garments from one person to another, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a new dedicated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on methods focus on garment-to-person tasks requiring flat garment representations, but there's a need for person-to-person try-on that only uses two input images - a target person and a source person wearing the desired garment - to generate realistic combinations.

Method: The paper proposes Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (FW-VTON) with three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the source image, (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose, and (3) integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. They also introduce a new dataset specifically for person-to-person try-on scenarios.

Result: FW-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior results in both qualitative and quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FW-VTON method successfully addresses the person-to-person virtual try-on task by effectively extracting, warping, and integrating garments, demonstrating superior performance and opening new possibilities for virtual try-on applications that don't require flat garment representations.

Abstract: Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.

### [8] [Is Tracking really more challenging in First Person Egocentric Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16015)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Zaira Manigrasso,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark study to disentangle whether performance challenges in egocentric visual tracking and segmentation stem from the first-person viewpoint itself or from the broader domain of human-object activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research attributed tracking and segmentation difficulties to egocentric vision's unique characteristics, but these evaluations were conducted across different scenarios. The authors question whether the performance drop is due to the first-person perspective or the human-object activity domain, as similar challenges exist in third-person videos of human activities.

Method: The authors designed a new benchmark study with an evaluation strategy that enables precise separation of challenges related to the first-person perspective from those linked to human-object activity understanding. This approach allows for controlled comparison between egocentric and third-person viewpoints.

Result: The benchmark provides deeper insights into the true sources of difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation by isolating the impact of viewpoint versus activity domain factors.

Conclusion: The study enables more targeted advancements in egocentric tracking and segmentation by clarifying whether challenges are inherent to the first-person perspective or common to human-object activity understanding regardless of viewpoint.

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.

### [9] [Artifacts and Attention Sinks: Structured Approximations for Efficient Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16018)
*Andrew Lu,Wentinn Liao,Liuhui Wang,Huzheng Yang,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates massive tokens and artifact tokens in vision transformers, proposing Fast Nyström Attention (FNA) - a training-free method that achieves linear time/space complexity by exploiting token patterns, with competitive performance across multiple vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers' inner workings remain partially understood, particularly the role of massive tokens (high activation norm tokens acting as attention sinks) and artifact tokens that emerge during inference and their impact on information flow regulation.

Method: The authors introduce Fast Nyström Attention (FNA), a training-free approximation method for self-attention that exploits structured patterns of massive and artifact tokens to achieve linear computational complexity. They also propose a masking strategy to reduce noise from these tokens.

Result: FNA demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question answering tasks across popular pretrained vision backbones, while significantly reducing computational overhead and achieving modest performance gains through the masking strategy.

Conclusion: The mutual suppression between massive and artifact tokens through attention mechanisms plays a critical role in regulating information flow in vision transformers, and this understanding can be leveraged to create efficient approximation methods that maintain competitive performance while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.

### [10] [Discovering and using Spelke segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16038)
*Rahul Venkatesh,Klemen Kotar,Lilian Naing Chen,Seungwoo Kim,Luca Thomas Wheeler,Jared Watrous,Ashley Xu,Gia Ancone,Wanhee Lee,Honglin Chen,Daniel Bear,Stefan Stojanov,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpelkeNet, a visual world model that segments images based on Spelke objects (groups that move together physically) rather than semantic categories, outperforming existing methods and improving downstream manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision segmentation relies on semantic categories, but humans perceive the world through Spelke objects - physical groupings that move together under forces. This category-agnostic approach based on causal motion relationships could better support manipulation and planning tasks.

Method: The authors develop SpelkeNet, a visual world model trained to predict future motion distributions. It estimates motion affordance maps (regions likely to move when poked) and expected-displacement maps (how the scene will move). These are used for "statistical counterfactual probing" where virtual pokes are applied to high-affordance regions to define Spelke segments based on correlated motion statistics.

Result: SpelkeNet outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on the newly introduced SpelkeBench dataset. The Spelke concept also demonstrates superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for physical object manipulation when integrated into various object manipulation models.

Conclusion: Spelke object segmentation based on physical motion relationships provides a more effective approach than semantic segmentation for manipulation tasks, with SpelkeNet successfully extracting these segments and improving downstream applications.

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

### [11] [Disrupting Semantic and Abstract Features for Better Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16052)
*Yuyang Luo,Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Yingzhe He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAFER, a feature-level adversarial attack method that improves transferability by disrupting both semantic and abstract (high-frequency) features using BLOCKMIX and SELF-MIX techniques to compute better feature importance weight matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-level adversarial attacks primarily focus on manipulating semantic information when computing feature importance weight matrices, but CNNs also rely heavily on high-frequency components (abstract features like texture and edges). This suggests that targeting both semantic and abstract features could improve attack transferability in black-box settings.

Method: The authors propose SAFER (Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption), which uses BLOCKMIX on input images and SELF-MIX on frequency spectrum when computing the feature importance weight matrix. This balanced approach allows the attacker to disrupt both semantic features and abstract high-frequency features simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that SAFER effectively boosts adversarial transferability compared to existing feature-level attack methods that only focus on semantic information.

Conclusion: By incorporating both semantic and abstract feature disruption through frequency domain transformations, SAFER achieves improved adversarial transferability, making it more effective for black-box attacks against real-world DNN applications.

Abstract: Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.

### [12] [Improving Personalized Image Generation through Social Context Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16095)
*Parul Gupta,Abhinav Dhall,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a feedback-based fine-tuning approach for personalized image generation that uses multiple detectors (pose, human-object-interaction, facial recognition, and gaze estimation) to improve the quality of generated images, addressing issues with complex activities, identity preservation, and gaze patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generation methods suffer from three major limitations: improper generation of complex activities with incorrect human poses, failure to preserve reference human identities, and unnatural/inconsistent human gaze patterns that don't match scene descriptions.

Method: The authors propose feedback-based fine-tuning of existing personalized generation methods using state-of-the-art detectors for pose, human-object-interaction, facial recognition, and gaze-point estimation to refine the diffusion model. They also introduce timestep-based incorporation of different feedback modules, distinguishing between low-level signals (like human pose) and high-level signals (like gaze point).

Result: The generated images show improvement in three key areas: better generated interactions, improved facial identities, and enhanced overall image quality. These improvements were demonstrated across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed feedback-based fine-tuning approach successfully addresses the major limitations of existing personalized image generation methods by incorporating multiple specialized detectors and timestep-based feedback integration, resulting in more accurate and higher-quality personalized image generation.

Abstract: Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.

*Yaofang Liu,Yumeng Ren,Aitor Artola,Yuxuan Hu,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaotong Zhao,Alan Zhao,Raymond H. Chan,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Dandan Tu,Jean-Michel Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pusa introduces vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) for video diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image-to-video generation performance with dramatically reduced training costs (1/200th) and dataset requirements (1/2500th) while enabling zero-shot multi-task capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models suffer from fundamental limitations in temporal modeling due to rigid synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep variables. Existing solutions like task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models are constrained by computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability.

Method: The paper presents vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA), a non-destructive adaptation method that enables fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework. VTA preserves the capabilities of the base model while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding combinatorial explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps.

Result: Pusa achieves a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32% (vs. 86.86% of Wan-I2V-14B) while using ≤1/200 of the training cost ($500 vs. ≥$100,000) and ≤1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs. ≥10M samples). The model demonstrates zero-shot multi-task capabilities including start-end frames and video extension without task-specific training, while maintaining text-to-video generation capabilities.

Conclusion: Pusa establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis that democratizes high-fidelity video generation. The approach successfully preserves foundation model generative priors while enabling superior temporal control, setting new standards for cost-effective video diffusion model development.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

*Guichen Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Xiangjun Gao,Che Sun,Yuwei Wu,Shenghua Gao,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongSplat is an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework that enables efficient novel view synthesis for long-sequence scenarios by using a streaming update mechanism and Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR) to incrementally integrate observations while compressing redundant historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are limited in online long-sequence scenarios due to slow per-scene optimization or lack of efficient incremental updates, which hinders continuous performance in real-time applications.

Method: The paper introduces LongSplat with a streaming update mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. The key innovation is Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), which encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured 2D image-like format to enable efficient fusion and identity-aware redundancy compression. The method also leverages existing image compression techniques to generate more compact and higher-quality 3D Gaussians.

Result: LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction performance while reducing Gaussian counts by 44% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

Conclusion: LongSplat successfully addresses the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting in online long-sequence scenarios by providing an efficient framework that maintains high-quality reconstruction while managing memory and computational costs through innovative representation and compression techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without
overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an
existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and
higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view
synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts
by 44\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first video action recognition dataset using spike cameras with synchronized RGB and thermal data, creating a benchmarking platform for Spiking Neural Networks and multimodal video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video action recognition lacks datasets specifically designed for spike cameras, which offer ultra-high energy efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. There's a need for comprehensive benchmarking platforms that can leverage the unique properties of spiking data while enabling comparison with traditional RGB and thermal modalities.

Method: The authors created three synchronized datasets combining spike camera data with RGB and thermal modalities for video action recognition. They preserved the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data to enable proper evaluation of Spiking Neural Networks and facilitate direct comparison across different sensing modalities.

Result: The work produced the first video action recognition dataset using spike cameras, providing a unique platform for exploring multimodal video understanding. The dataset enables comprehensive benchmarking for SNNs and serves as a valuable resource for comparing spiking, thermal, and RGB modalities in action recognition tasks.

Conclusion: This dataset contribution will drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding, specifically advancing action recognition using spike-based data. It establishes a foundation for future work in bio-inspired vision sensors and multimodal learning approaches.

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,
thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will

*Jyun-Ze Tang,Chih-Fan Hsu,Jeng-Lin Li,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen), a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in latent space using a lightweight upsampler to improve efficiency and quality in text-to-image generation, achieving up to 246% TOPIQ score improvement over conventional scaling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flow matching and diffusion models for text-to-image generation use early denoising at lower resolutions to speed up synthesis, but conventional pixel-space downscaling/upscaling methods introduce artifacts and distortions when images are re-encoded into latent space, degrading final image quality.

Method: The authors propose Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen), a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler, without modifying the existing Transformer or U-Net architecture, enabling flexible multi-resolution generation.

Result: LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches in comprehensive evaluations covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality. When generating 1024² images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246% improvement in TOPIQ score compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LSSGen successfully addresses the artifacts and quality degradation issues of traditional pixel-space scaling by operating directly in latent space, demonstrating superior performance in both efficiency and visual quality for text-to-image generation while maintaining architectural flexibility.

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

*Hui Ye,Haodong Chen,Zeke Zexi Hu,Xiaoming Chen,Yuk Ying Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes AMMNet, an asymmetric multi-modal network for RGB-DSM semantic segmentation in remote sensing that reduces computational complexity while improving segmentation accuracy through specialized encoders and alignment mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal semantic segmentation methods for RGB and DSM data suffer from two major limitations: increased computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded performance caused by modality misalignment, particularly in complex urban environments where precise integration is essential.

Method: The method introduces three key components: (1) Asymmetric Dual Encoder (ADE) that uses a deeper encoder for RGB to capture rich contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse structural features, (2) Asymmetric Prior Fuser (APF) that integrates modality-aware prior matrix for structure-aware contextual features, and (3) Distribution Alignment (DA) module that enhances cross-modal compatibility through feature distribution alignment via divergence minimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets show that AMMNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among multi-modal networks while simultaneously reducing computational and memory requirements compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AMMNet successfully addresses the key challenges in multi-modal remote sensing segmentation by providing an efficient asymmetric architecture that achieves superior performance with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for complex urban environment analysis.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.

*Tao Wang,Tiecheng Bai,Chao Xu,Bin Liu,Erlei Zhang,Jiyun Huang,Hongming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes AtrousMamba, a novel visual state space model that combines Mamba's linear complexity with enhanced local feature extraction through an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, achieving superior performance on change detection tasks compared to CNN, Transformer, and existing Mamba-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based visual models focus on enhancing global receptive fields but overlook the importance of local information in dense prediction tasks. There's an open question about whether Mamba can effectively extract local features like CNNs do, which is critical for tasks requiring fine-grained spatial understanding.

Method: The paper introduces AtrousMamba with an atrous-window selective scan mechanism that gradually expands the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design shortens distances between adjacent tokens, enabling effective capture of both fine-grained local features and global context. They develop the AWVSS module and create dedicated frameworks AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD for binary and semantic change detection tasks.

Result: Experimental evaluation on six benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based methods for change detection tasks. The results show that Mamba can effectively preserve fine-grained local details while capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Mamba can effectively balance local and global feature extraction in visual tasks. AtrousMamba successfully addresses the limitation of existing Mamba variants by incorporating local information processing capabilities, proving that visual state space models can compete with and surpass traditional CNN and Transformer approaches for dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.

*Fansheng Zeng,Bineng Zhong,Haiying Xia,Yufei Tan,Xiantao Hu,Liangtao Shi,Shuxiang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSTrack proposes a visual tracking algorithm that explicitly models contextual reasoning through three mechanisms: a context reasoning pipeline, forward supervision strategy, and efficient state modeling to improve temporal consistency and prevent contextual association divergence in cross-frame tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream tracking algorithms associate context by simply stacking historical information without explicit supervision, making it difficult to effectively model target's evolving dynamics and leading to contextual association divergence in temporal modeling.

Method: RSTrack employs three core mechanisms: 1) Context Reasoning Mechanism that constructs a target state reasoning pipeline to predict current representation based on historical states, 2) Forward Supervision Strategy that uses true target features as anchors to constrain reasoning and prevent drift, and 3) Efficient State Modeling that uses compression-reconstruction to extract core target features and remove redundant information.

Result: RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds, effectively alleviating contextual association divergence issues in traditional temporal modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed RSTrack successfully addresses the limitations of traditional contextual association methods in visual tracking by explicitly modeling and supervising the context reasoning process, leading to improved temporal consistency and superior tracking performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces EBench-18K, a large-scale benchmark with 18K edited images and human annotations for evaluating text-guided image editing models, and proposes LMM4Edit, a comprehensive LMM-based evaluation metric that aligns well with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided image editing models struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with original images. Existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations in scale and alignment with human perception, creating a need for better evaluation frameworks.

Method: The authors create EBench-18K benchmark containing 1,080 source images with editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images from 17 state-of-the-art models, and 55K+ human preference scores. They then develop LMM4Edit, a large multimodal model-based metric that evaluates image editing from multiple dimensions: perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy.

Result: LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and demonstrates strong alignment with human preferences on the EBench-18K benchmark. The metric also shows good generalization ability when tested on other datasets in zero-shot validation experiments.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the evaluation gap in text-guided image editing by providing a comprehensive benchmark and an effective evaluation metric that correlates well with human judgment, offering valuable tools for advancing the field of text-guided image editing.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

### [23] [A Single-step Accurate Fingerprint Registration Method Based on Local Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16201)
*Yuwei Jia,Zhe Cui,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end single-step fingerprint registration method that directly predicts semi-dense matching points to align fingerprints, avoiding the failure-prone minutiae-based initial registration step while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-step fingerprint registration methods (minutiae-based initial registration followed by dense registration) frequently fail when fingerprint image quality is low because fewer minutiae are detected, causing the initial registration to fail and ultimately leading to complete registration failure.

Method: Developed an end-to-end single-step algorithm that directly predicts semi-dense matching point correspondences between two fingerprints using global-local attention mechanisms, bypassing the need for minutiae-based initial registration and achieving pixel-level alignment.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art matching performance with only single-step registration and can be combined with dense registration algorithms for further performance improvements. The approach successfully minimizes registration failure risks compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The single-step fingerprint registration approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional two-step methods by eliminating dependence on minutiae detection quality, providing robust performance even with low-quality fingerprint images, and maintaining compatibility with existing dense registration techniques.

Abstract: Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.

TL;DR: MVP-LM is a unified visual perception framework that integrates Visual Large Language Models to handle diverse perception tasks (detection, segmentation, grounding, etc.) across different granularities and instruction types within a single architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision research typically focuses on limited subsets of perception tasks, which constrains their applicability and versatility. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle the full spectrum of perception tasks across different prediction types (word/sentence-based) and instruction types (box/mask predictions).

Method: The paper proposes MVP-LM with three key components: (1) a multi-granularity decoder that handles both word-based and sentence-based tasks, (2) a CoT-inspired dataset unification strategy for seamless supervised fine-tuning across diverse tasks, and (3) a query enhancement strategy to leverage the decoding and generative capabilities of Visual Large Language Models.

Result: Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MVP-LM on both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks, including panoptic segmentation, detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation.

Conclusion: MVP-LM successfully unifies multiple perception tasks within a single Visual Large Language Model architecture, demonstrating improved versatility and applicability across diverse computer vision contexts through its multi-granular approach and innovative design strategies.

Abstract: Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and

subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability
and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we
present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework

*Jijun Wang,Yan Wu,Yujian Mo,Junqiao Zhao,Jun Yan,Yinghao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDRFusion proposes a LiDAR-dominant two-stage framework for 3D object detection that first uses LiDAR-only proposals for accurate localization, then incorporates pseudo point clouds for challenging instances, achieving strong performance on KITTI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods suffer from noise introduced by pseudo point clouds from depth completion, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. The authors recognize that different modalities have varying reliability levels and roles in 3D object detection.

Method: LDRFusion uses a two-stage refinement framework: Stage 1 relies solely on LiDAR for accurate proposal generation, Stage 2 incorporates pseudo point clouds to detect challenging instances, followed by merging instance-level results. A hierarchical pseudo point residual encoding module enhances local structure representation using feature and positional residuals.

Result: Experiments on KITTI dataset show that LDRFusion consistently achieves strong performance across multiple object categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LiDAR-dominant approach.

Conclusion: The LiDAR-dominant two-stage framework effectively addresses the noise issues in pseudo point clouds while leveraging the strengths of both modalities, resulting in improved 3D object detection performance compared to existing fusion methods.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D
object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as
auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate
detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual
encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and
positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our
framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories
and difficulty levels.

TL;DR: MONITRS introduces a multimodal dataset of 10,000+ FEMA disaster events with satellite imagery and natural language annotations to improve machine learning-based disaster monitoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current disaster response systems are limited by difficulty accessing affected areas, narrow focus on specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations for tracking disaster progression.

Method: The authors created MONITRS, a multimodal dataset containing over 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite imagery, natural language annotations from news articles, geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. They fine-tuned existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning existing MLLMs on the MONITRS dataset yielded significant performance improvements for disaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine learning-assisted disaster response systems.

Conclusion: The MONITRS dataset successfully addresses key limitations in current disaster monitoring approaches by providing comprehensive multimodal data that enables better automated analysis of disaster events and establishes a new standard for ML-based disaster response systems.

Abstract: Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure
every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite
imagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on
specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of
datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations
for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal
dataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite
imagery and natural language annotations from news articles, accompanied by
geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning
existing MLLMs on our dataset yields significant performance improvements for
disaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine
learning-assisted disaster response systems. Code can be found at:

### [27] [Positive Style Accumulation: A Style Screening and Continuous Utilization Framework for Federated DG-ReID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16238)
*Xin Xu,Chaoyue Ren,Wei Liu,Wenke Huang,Bin Yang,Zhixi Yu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SSCU framework for federated domain generalization in person re-identification that screens positive styles and continuously utilizes them through dynamic memory and collaborative training to improve model generalization across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods for person re-identification use style transformation to enhance diversity, but not all styles contribute positively to generalization performance. The paper aims to identify and continuously utilize beneficial (positive) styles while avoiding harmful (negative) styles.

Method: The authors propose Style Screening and Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework with three key components: (1) Generalization Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) to screen and accumulate positive styles, (2) style memory recognition loss to leverage memorized positive styles, and (3) Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy that trains client models on two branches using both newly generated and accumulated positive styles.

Result: Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in both source domain and target domain performance for federated person re-identification tasks.

Conclusion: The SSCU framework effectively addresses the challenge of style selection in federated domain generalization by systematically screening positive styles and ensuring their continuous utilization, leading to improved generalization performance across different domains in person re-identification tasks.

Abstract: The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.

*Chao Zhou,Tianyi Wei,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS) to address text instruction neglect in unified image generation models like OmniGen, particularly when dealing with multiple sub-instructions, by dynamically scaling attention activation without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image generation models like OmniGen suffer from text instruction neglect, especially when text instructions contain multiple sub-instructions. This issue limits the models' ability to faithfully follow complex instructions in image generation and editing tasks.

Method: The authors propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), which leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. The method uses perturbation analysis and cross-attention map examination to identify conflicts between neglected sub-instructions and input image activations.

Result: Experimental results on instruction-based image editing and visual conditional image generation demonstrate that SaaS achieves superior instruction-following fidelity compared to existing methods, effectively addressing the text instruction neglect problem without requiring additional training or test-time optimization.

Conclusion: SaaS successfully enhances instruction-following fidelity in unified image generation models by addressing attention conflicts between sub-instructions and input images. The method provides a training-free solution that improves the reliability of complex instruction following in image generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoliTracer is the first framework for holistic vector extraction from large-size remote sensing imagery, using Context Attention Net for segmentation and a robust pipeline with Mask Contour Reformer and Polygon Sequence Tracer for vectorization, outperforming existing methods on building, water body, and road datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vector mapping from remote sensing imagery are constrained to small image patches, leading to loss of contextual information and fragmented vector outputs when processing large-size RSI, necessitating a holistic approach that can handle large images while preserving context.

Method: The method consists of three main components: (1) Context Attention Net (CAN) that uses local-to-global attention mechanism to enhance segmentation of large-size RSI by capturing contextual dependencies, (2) Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) for polygon reconstruction, and (3) Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) for vertex tracing, all integrated into a robust vectorization pipeline.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-size RSI datasets including buildings, water bodies, and roads demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in vectorized geographic object extraction from high-resolution remote sensing imagery.

Conclusion: HoliTracer successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing the first holistic framework for vector extraction from large-size remote sensing imagery, achieving superior performance through its context-aware segmentation and robust vectorization pipeline.

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on

*Seunghyeon Kim,Kyeongryeol Go*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric approach to improve fisheye camera object detection by identifying model blind spots through error analysis and generating synthetic edge-case images to address specific failure modes like class confusion, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion that creates unique challenges for object detection models trained on conventional datasets, leading to poor performance in specialized scenarios with peripheral distortions and edge cases.

Method: The authors propose a data-centric pipeline that: (1) conducts detailed error analysis to identify critical edge-cases including confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented contexts, (2) fine-tunes an image generative model with carefully crafted prompts to synthesize images replicating real-world failure modes, and (3) pseudo-labels synthetic images using a high-quality detector and integrates them into training.

Result: The approach achieves consistent performance gains in fisheye object detection by systematically addressing identified weaknesses through targeted synthetic data generation and integration.

Conclusion: Understanding data deeply and selectively fixing its weaknesses through edge-case synthesis can be highly impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric approaches over purely algorithmic solutions.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges

fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its

### [31] [Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257)
*Futa Waseda,Saku Sugawara,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes QT-AFT (Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning) to improve adversarial robustness of vision-language models like CLIP by using high-quality captions during training, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods for vision-language models have limitations: supervised methods overfit to training object classes using short texts, while unsupervised methods lack semantic guidance against text-guided attacks. There's a need to better leverage language information to enhance visual robustness in VLMs.

Method: QT-AFT (Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning) uses high-quality captions during training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics in images. This approach enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize broader image features under adversarial noise, combining the benefits of semantic guidance while avoiding overfitting to specific object classes.

Result: QT-AFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy across 16 zero-shot datasets. The method successfully overcomes overfitting issues in supervised adversarial training and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised approaches. Additional insights show that describing object properties beyond names further enhances robustness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that high-quality linguistic supervision is crucial for robust visual representation learning. QT-AFT effectively balances semantic guidance and generalization, pointing to an important future research direction of centering quality language supervision in developing robust vision-language models.

Abstract: Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.

### [32] [ToFe: Lagged Token Freezing and Reusing for Efficient Vision Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16260)
*Haoyue Zhang,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToFe (Token Freezing and Reusing), a framework that improves Vision Transformer efficiency by temporarily freezing unimportant tokens instead of discarding them, allowing their reuse in later blocks while reducing computational cost by 50% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers are computationally expensive due to self-attention mechanisms, hindering deployment on resource-constrained devices. Existing token reduction methods irreversibly discard tokens, but different transformer blocks focus on different information, so early-discarded tokens might be useful later. There's a need to balance model performance with computational efficiency.

Method: The ToFe framework identifies important tokens at each stage and temporarily freezes unimportant ones for later reuse. It includes: (1) a prediction module for token identification, (2) an approximate module for recovery of frozen tokens, and (3) computation budget-aware end-to-end training that jointly optimizes with the backbone to adaptively process necessary tokens at each block.

Result: ToFe reduces computational cost of LV-ViT model by 50% while maintaining less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy. The method achieves better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The Token Freezing and Reusing framework successfully addresses the efficiency limitations of Vision Transformers by enabling adaptive token processing that preserves performance while significantly reducing computational overhead, making ViTs more suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Junhao Su,Feiyu Zhu,Hengyu Shi,Tianyang Han,Yurui Qiu,Junfeng Luo,Xiaoming Wei,Jialin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAN++ (Momentum Auxiliary Network++), a supervised local learning method that uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks and learnable scaling bias to enable inter-block communication, achieving performance comparable to end-to-end backpropagation while reducing GPU memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional end-to-end backpropagation suffers from update locking, high GPU memory consumption, and lack of biological plausibility. Existing supervised local learning methods partition networks into local blocks but experience performance degradation due to limited inter-block information flow, as gradients only propagate within individual blocks.

Method: MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to facilitate inter-block communication. The method includes auxiliary networks updated via EMA to bridge information gaps between blocks, and incorporates learnable scaling bias to handle feature discrepancies between local blocks.

Result: Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and image segmentation across multiple network architectures show that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: MAN++ successfully addresses the limitations of supervised local learning by enabling effective inter-block communication, offering a viable alternative to conventional end-to-end training methods that maintains performance while providing memory efficiency benefits.

Abstract: Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.

*Zefeng Qian,Xincheng Yao,Yifei Huang,Chongyang Zhang,Jiangyong Ying,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a framework that uses Large Language Models to break down action labels into atomic components (subject, motion, object) and combines this with visual segmentation to improve few-shot action recognition in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot action recognition suffers from limited training data, and existing text-based approaches only use action labels which cannot fully capture the subtle variations in human posture, motion dynamics, and object interactions that are critical for understanding actions across different phases.

Method: The method uses LLMs to anatomize action labels into atomic action descriptions focusing on subject, motion, and object. A Visual Anatomy Module segments videos into atomic phases. The approach employs fine-grained fusion at the atomic level and introduces a Multimodal Matching mechanism with both video-video and video-text matching for classification.

Result: LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple few-shot action recognition benchmarks, demonstrating improved capability to capture rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios through the anatomized representations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that decomposing action labels into atomic components using LLMs and combining them with visual segmentation creates more generalizable prototypes, leading to superior performance in few-shot action recognition compared to existing approaches that rely solely on action labels.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dens3R is a 3D foundation model that jointly predicts multiple geometric quantities (depth, surface normals, point maps) from images using a unified framework with structural coupling, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict only single geometry quantities in isolation, failing to ensure consistency between inherently correlated geometric properties like depth, surface normals, and point maps, which limits accuracy and practical applicability in dense 3D reconstruction.

Method: A two-stage training framework with a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone, position-interpolated rotary positional encoding for robustness, integration of image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling, and a post-processing pipeline for geometrically consistent multi-view inference.

Result: Superior performance across various dense 3D prediction tasks, achieving accurate joint regression of multiple geometric quantities and consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs.

Conclusion: Dens3R successfully addresses the limitation of isolated geometric quantity prediction by modeling structural coupling among different geometric properties, demonstrating strong potential for broader applications in dense 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.

*Yanchen Liu,Yanan Sun,Zhening Xing,Junyao Gao,Kai Chen,Wenjie Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionShot is a training-free framework that enables high-fidelity motion transfer between objects with significant appearance or structural differences by using semantic feature matching and morphological alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video methods fail to smoothly transfer motion from reference objects to target objects when there are significant differences in appearance or structure between them, creating a need for better motion transfer capabilities.

Method: MotionShot uses a two-stage approach: (1) semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between reference and target objects, and (2) reference-to-target shape retargeting for low-level morphological alignments. Motion is encoded using temporal attention to enable coherent transfer across disparate objects.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across objects even when there are significant appearance and structure disparities, achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while preserving appearance coherence.

Conclusion: MotionShot successfully addresses the challenge of motion transfer between structurally and visually different objects through fine-grained correspondence parsing, offering a training-free solution that maintains both motion fidelity and appearance coherence.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

Motivation: Current RGBT multispectral vision research follows a case-by-case paradigm with manually customized models for specific tasks, which is constrained by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck limitations. There's a need for a unified approach that can generalize across multiple RGBT tasks.

Method: The authors develop M-SpecGene, a generalized RGBT foundation model using self-supervised learning on large-scale data. They introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify information density across RGB and thermal modalities, and propose a GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy for flexible, easy-to-hard, object-centric pre-training.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets covering four different RGBT downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the unified foundation model approach over task-specific methods.

Conclusion: M-SpecGene successfully addresses the limitations of case-by-case RGBT research by providing a unified foundation model that learns modality-invariant representations, offering new insights into multispectral fusion and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across multiple RGBT tasks and datasets.

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

*Joseph De Mathia,Carlos Francisco Moreno-García*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates Scene Text Detection and Recognition (STDR) performance using Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, analyzing how environmental factors like lighting, distance, and resolution affect OCR algorithms in real-world egocentric vision scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of wearable technology and AR applications, there's a need to understand how environmental variables affect text recognition performance in real-world egocentric vision scenarios using smart glasses, which could enable better assistive and research-oriented applications.

Method: The researchers created a custom dataset using Meta's Project Aria smart glasses under controlled conditions and evaluated two OCR pipelines (EAST with CRNN, and EAST with PyTesseract) across different environmental variables including lighting, distance, and resolution. They also explored image upscaling as a pre-processing technique and investigated eye-gaze tracking integration.

Result: Resolution and distance significantly impact recognition accuracy, while lighting has less predictable effects. Image upscaling as pre-processing substantially improved performance, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. Eye-gaze tracking showed potential for optimizing processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones.

Conclusion: The study successfully benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions and establishes groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. The findings provide insights for developing robust, context-sensitive text recognition systems for applications like asset inspection and nutrition analysis.

Abstract: In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text
Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and
resolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in
real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under
controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST
with PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance
significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less
predictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing
technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further
demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise
processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only
benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the
groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to
inspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for
assistive and research-oriented applications, such as asset inspection and
nutrition analysis. The code is available at

*Xinyu Mao,Xiaohan Xing,Fei Meng,Jianbang Liu,Fan Bai,Qiang Nie,Max Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OP-SAM is a one-shot polyp segmentation framework that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image to enable accurate polyp segmentation without manual prompt input, achieving 76.93% IoU on Kvasir dataset and outperforming state-of-the-art by 11.44%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional polyp segmentation methods struggle with morphological variability and domain shifts requiring frequent retraining, while large-scale annotation is time-consuming and error-prone. Although SAM shows strong generalizability, its prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications due to the labor-intensive manual prompt input requirement.

Method: The method introduces three key components: (1) Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer from a single annotated image, (2) Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations and filter noisy transfers, and (3) Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement to progressively enhance segmentation quality.

Result: OP-SAM achieves 76.93% IoU on the Kvasir dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate the framework's effectiveness in polyp segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: OP-SAM successfully addresses the automation limitation of SAM in medical applications by enabling automatic prompt generation from a single annotated image, providing accurate and generalizable polyp segmentation without additional annotation burdens while significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.

*Mingtao Guo,Guanyu Xing,Yanci Zhang,Yanli Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRVD is a novel face reenactment framework that uses video diffusion models to generate high-quality talking head videos with large pose variations by combining implicit keypoint extraction, motion alignment, and a warping feature mapper that leverages pretrained video priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face reenactment methods struggle with large pose variations due to warping artifacts when using implicit keypoints or limitations of coarse facial landmarks when using explicit keypoints, creating a need for better handling of extreme pose changes while preserving identity and motion fidelity.

Method: The method uses a motion extractor to extract implicit facial keypoints from source and driving images, performs motion alignment through warping, and introduces a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) that maps warped source images into the motion-aware latent space of a pretrained image-to-video model to correct warping degradation and enhance temporal coherence.

Result: FRVD achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios with extreme pose variations, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model successfully addresses the limitations of existing face reenactment methods by leveraging video diffusion priors and warping correction, enabling high-fidelity face reenactment even under large pose changes while maintaining identity preservation and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.

Motivation: The task of online detection of Take and Release (OTR) actions in untrimmed egocentric videos faces significant challenges including severe label imbalance with temporally sparse positive annotations, the need for precise temporal predictions, and computational efficiency requirements for real-world online deployment.

Method: The authors propose Mamba-OTR based on the Mamba architecture that exploits temporal recurrence during inference while being trained on short video clips. The training pipeline incorporates focal loss to address label imbalance and a novel regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.

Result: Mamba-OTR achieves mp-mAP of 45.48 in sliding-window mode and 43.35 in streaming mode on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset, significantly outperforming vanilla transformer (20.32) and vanilla Mamba (25.16) baselines. The model demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly on full-length videos and high frame-rate sequences.

Conclusion: Mamba-OTR provides a strong baseline for online take and release detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of Mamba architecture for temporal action detection tasks. The model successfully addresses the challenges of label imbalance and computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces challenges in unconstrained environments due to perspective distortions from various shooting angles and the need to handle both single-line and double-line license plates. Edge devices require low-complexity, end-to-end solutions for real-time deployment.

Method: The authors develop LPTR-AFLNet, which combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized recognition network AFLNet. The method uses recognition output as weak supervisory signals to guide correction, incorporates an improved attention module to reduce character confusion, and employs Focal Loss to address class imbalance.

Result: LPTR-AFLNet demonstrates exceptional performance in correcting perspective distortion and recognizing double-line license plates while maintaining high accuracy across challenging scenarios. The method achieves real-time performance with execution times under 10 milliseconds on lower-mid-range GPU platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed LPTR-AFLNet successfully addresses the challenges of Chinese license plate recognition by providing an efficient, lightweight solution that combines correction and recognition in a unified framework, making it suitable for practical deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAR, a large-scale astronomical super-resolution dataset with 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs, and proposes FISR model that outperforms existing methods by 24.84% on flux consistency metrics for astronomical imaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing astronomical super-resolution datasets suffer from three critical limitations: flux inconsistency, object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, which significantly impede the development of astronomical super-resolution methods needed for detecting faraway celestial objects and precise structural analysis.

Method: The authors develop STAR dataset using Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution observations paired with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated through a flux-preserving pipeline. They introduce a novel Flux Error (FE) metric for evaluation and propose the Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR) model that accurately infers flux-consistent high-resolution images from input photometry.

Result: The FISR model suppresses several state-of-the-art super-resolution methods by 24.84% on the novel flux consistency metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and validate the value of the STAR dataset for astronomical super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The STAR dataset addresses critical limitations in astronomical super-resolution by providing flux-consistent, field-level image pairs, while the FISR model shows superior performance in maintaining physical accuracy. This work significantly advances astronomical imaging capabilities for cost-effective high-resolution capture and celestial object analysis.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial
objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for
astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset
containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide
celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biologically-informed approach for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain fMRI data by using sphere tokenization, structural MRI integration, and positive-sample mixup to better preserve spatial brain structure and individual anatomical variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain activity ignore critical brain structure-function relationships by flattening spatial information and neglecting individual anatomical variations, which limits reconstruction accuracy and biological interpretability.

Method: The approach includes three key innovations: (1) a sphere tokenizer that models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D spherical data on the cortical surface, (2) integration of structural MRI data to encode individual anatomical variations, and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy to efficiently leverage multiple fMRI scans of the same visual stimulus.

Result: Experiments show superior reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability, and generalizability across different individuals.

Conclusion: The biologically-informed approach that preserves spatial brain structure and incorporates individual anatomical differences significantly improves visual stimulus reconstruction from fMRI data while maintaining biological interpretability.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity (e.g., fMRI) bridges
neuroscience and computer vision by decoding neural representations. However,
existing methods often overlook critical brain structure-function
relationships, flattening spatial information and neglecting individual
anatomical variations. To address these issues, we propose (1) a novel sphere
tokenizer that explicitly models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D
spherical data on the cortical surface; (2) integration of structural MRI
(sMRI) data, enabling personalized encoding of individual anatomical
variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,
and generalizability across individuals. Experiments demonstrate superior
reconstruction performance compared to SOTA methods, highlighting the

### [45] [Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393)
*Lazaro Janier Gonzalez-Sole,Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot presentation attack detection (PAD) framework for face recognition systems using foundation models, which can detect attacks without requiring training on attack data and shows superior generalization performance compared to traditional deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks (spoofing), and current deep learning PAD methods require large amounts of training data and lack generalizability to unknown attack types or databases. There is a need for PAD systems that can work without extensive training on attack data.

Method: The authors propose a zero-shot PAD framework that leverages foundation models for presentation attack detection. They assess the effectiveness and generalizability of these foundation models in established and challenging experimental scenarios without requiring training on presentation attack data.

Result: The foundation models achieve competitive performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort compared to advanced PAD mechanisms trained on attack data. The top-performing foundation model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods using the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database containing challenging 2D and 3D attacks.

Conclusion: Foundation models can effectively perform zero-shot presentation attack detection, offering better generalization capabilities than traditional deep learning approaches while requiring no training on attack presentations. This represents a significant advancement in making face recognition systems more robust against unknown attack types.

Abstract: Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADCD-Net is a robust document forgery detection model that adaptively uses RGB/DCT forensic traces and integrates document-specific characteristics to achieve superior performance in localizing tampered regions, outperforming existing methods by 20.79% across various distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detectors for natural images struggle with document images because tampered regions can be seamlessly blended into uniform document backgrounds and structured text. Additionally, current document-specific methods lack sufficient robustness against various degradations, limiting their practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes ADCD-Net with three key components: (1) adaptive modulation of DCT feature contribution based on predicted alignment scores to handle block misalignment sensitivity, (2) hierarchical content disentanglement to mitigate text-background disparities and boost localization performance, and (3) construction of pristine prototypes that capture traces of untampered regions to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Result: ADCD-Net demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79% averaged over 5 types of distortions. The model shows improved resilience to various distortions including resizing and cropping, with enhanced localization accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: ADCD-Net successfully addresses the challenges of document image forgery detection by adaptively leveraging forensic traces and incorporating document-specific characteristics. The proposed approach significantly improves robustness against degradations and achieves substantial performance gains over existing methods, making it more suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.

TL;DR: This paper proposes GPI-Net, a Gestalt-guided network for point cloud registration that uses orthogonal geometric consistency to better fuse local and global features for identifying high-quality correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud registration requires accurate identification of high-quality correspondences, but fusing local and global features is challenging due to feature redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Existing methods struggle to effectively handle the integration of multi-scale information.

Method: The paper introduces GPI-Net with three key components: (1) an orthogonal integration strategy to reduce redundant information and create compact global structures, (2) a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block using hybrid self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, and (3) a Dual-path Multi-Granularity (DMG) block for parallel interaction aggregation across different granularities.

Result: Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks demonstrate that GPI-Net achieves superior performance compared to existing point cloud registration methods.

Conclusion: GPI-Net successfully leverages Gestalt principles to facilitate complementary communication between local and global information, leading to improved point cloud registration performance through better correspondence identification.

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

*Tanveer Younis,Zhanglin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey reviews recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction methods, comparing neural implicit models (NeRF variants), explicit point-cloud approaches (3D Gaussian Splatting), and hybrid frameworks using diffusion and vision foundation models to address challenges when minimal image overlap prevents traditional SfM/MVS methods from working.


<details>

Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods like structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS) fail in sparse-view scenarios where minimal image overlap prevents reliable correspondence matching, yet such scenarios are common in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems where dense image acquisition is impractical.

Method: The paper surveys three main categories of sparse-view 3D reconstruction approaches: (1) neural implicit models including NeRF and its regularized versions, (2) explicit point-cloud-based methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting, and (3) hybrid frameworks leveraging priors from diffusion models and vision foundation models, analyzing how they use geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference.

Result: Comparative analysis on standard benchmarks reveals key trade-offs between reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across different methods. The survey identifies that geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference help mitigate common artifacts like floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.

Conclusion: The survey highlights persistent challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction, and outlines future research directions including developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction. It provides a unified perspective bridging geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

### [51] [Combined Image Data Augmentations diminish the benefits of Adaptive Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16427)
*Georg Siedel,Ekagra Gupta,Weijia Shao,Silvia Vock,Andrey Morozov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper extends adaptive label smoothing (soft augmentation) beyond random-crop to other aggressive augmentations like random erasing and noise injection, finding it effective for limited transformation types but detrimental when used with diverse augmentation methods like TrivialAugment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original soft augmentation framework only applied adaptive label smoothing to random-crop augmentation. The authors wanted to explore whether this regularization technique could be extended to other types of aggressive data augmentations to improve supervised learning of image classifiers.

Method: The authors extended the adaptive label smoothing framework to random erasing and noise injection augmentations, where label confidence is reduced based on the magnitude of augmentation applied. They tested this approach with various augmentation intensities and compared performance with diverse augmentation methods like TrivialAugment.

Result: Adaptive label smoothing showed effectiveness for random erasing and noise injection, allowing for stronger regularization with higher-intensity Random Erasing. However, the benefits disappeared when applied with diverse image transformations (TrivialAugment), and excessive label smoothing reduced robustness to common corruptions.

Conclusion: Adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when training data distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation types. It is not beneficial when used with diverse augmentation strategies and can harm model robustness when applied excessively.

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

### [52] [Robust Noisy Pseudo-label Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation Using Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16429)
*Lin Xi,Yingliang Ma,Cheng Wang,Sandra Howell,Aldo Rinaldi,Kawal S. Rhode*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation that uses prototype-based contrastive consistency to improve robustness against noisy pseudo-labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level medical image annotations are expensive and time-consuming, requiring expert collaboration. Existing semi-supervised methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels that corrupt semantic distributions in latent space, limiting segmentation accuracy when leveraging abundant unlabeled data.

Method: A novel diffusion-based framework that introduces prototype-based contrastive consistency constraints during the denoising diffusion process. Uses class prototypes as centralized semantic anchors in latent space rather than explicit semantic boundary delineation to improve robustness against noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods on EndoScapes2023 and newly introduced MOSXAV datasets under semi-supervised learning settings. Also introduces MOSXAV benchmark with detailed manual annotations for multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion model provides a robust and data-efficient solution for semi-supervised medical image segmentation with enhanced flexibility and strong potential for diverse clinical applications, effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotated medical data.

Abstract: Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-Long is a system that enables foundation models to perform kilometer-scale monocular 3D reconstruction in outdoor environments by using chunk-based processing, overlapping alignment, and loop closure optimization without requiring camera calibration or depth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for 3D vision show great potential but face memory limitations when applied to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction, preventing their use in unbounded outdoor environments like autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization to address scalability bottlenecks, enabling processing of long RGB sequences without camera calibration, depth supervision, or model retraining.

Result: VGGT-Long successfully processes long RGB sequences where foundation models typically fail, achieving trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets while producing accurate and consistent geometry across various conditions.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of leveraging foundation models for scalable monocular 3D scene reconstruction in real-world settings, particularly for autonomous driving applications, by overcoming memory limitations through efficient processing strategies.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models
for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for
autonomous driving scenarios. Code is available at

### [54] [DenseSR: Image Shadow Removal as Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16472)
*Yu-Fan Lin,Chia-Ming Lee,Chih-Chung Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseSR proposes a dense prediction framework for single-image shadow removal that combines geometric-semantic priors for scene understanding with a novel Dense Fusion Block to achieve high-fidelity restoration while maintaining sharp boundaries and consistent appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional shadow removal methods fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details and maintain sharp boundaries due to non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity in challenging indirect illumination, resulting in inconsistent restoration and blurring that negatively affects downstream applications and viewing experience.

Method: The DenseSR framework uses two key strategies: (1) deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration via a Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder that employs adaptive component processing through an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for fine textures and sharp boundaries.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DenseSR over existing methods in shadow removal quality, successfully addressing the inconsistent restoration and blurring issues that plague traditional approaches.

Conclusion: DenseSR effectively tackles single-image shadow removal challenges by approaching it from a dense prediction perspective, synergizing geometric-semantic understanding with adaptive component processing to achieve optimized feature representation that preserves both consistency and fidelity in shadow removal.

Abstract: Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework for cancer survival prediction from whole slide pathology images that uses dynamic patch selection, graph-guided clustering, attention mechanisms, and mixture density modeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance on renal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving cancer-specific survival prediction accuracy from whole slide pathology images (WSIs) by addressing challenges like large image sizes, tissue heterogeneity, and complex survival distributions that current state-of-the-art methods struggle with.

Method: A four-component modular framework: (1) dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding to identify prognostically informative regions, (2) graph-guided k-means clustering for capturing phenotype-level heterogeneity, (3) attention mechanisms modeling intra- and inter-cluster relationships for contextualizing features, and (4) expert-guided mixture density modeling using Gaussian mixture models for survival distribution estimation.

Result: Achieved concordance index of 0.712±0.028 and Brier score of 0.254±0.018 on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and concordance index of 0.645±0.017 and Brier score of 0.281±0.031 on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for cancer survival prediction and shows predictive potential across diverse cancer types, validating the effectiveness of combining dynamic patch selection, spatial clustering, attention mechanisms, and mixture density modeling.

Abstract: We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from
whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than
the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method
across diverse cancer types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv10 and SAM2 to remove heterogeneous backgrounds from herbarium images, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance (IoU: 0.94, Dice: 0.97) and improving botanical classification accuracy by up to 4.36%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning classification of herbarium images suffers from background heterogeneity that introduces noise and artifacts, misleading models and reducing classification accuracy. Addressing these background-related challenges is critical for improving model performance in botanical image analysis.

Method: The authors developed PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10 for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and evaluated using IoU and Dice coefficient metrics.

Result: PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance with an IoU of 0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. When segmented images were incorporated into classification models, consistent performance improvements were observed across five tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score improvements of 4.15%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that background removal through automated segmentation significantly enhances classification accuracy in herbarium image analysis by allowing models to focus more effectively on foreground plant structures. PlantSAM provides an effective solution for addressing background heterogeneity challenges in botanical image classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C2-Evo is an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities in multimodal large language models, addressing the challenges of data complexity discrepancies and mismatched difficulty levels through cross-modal data evolution and data-model evolution loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs require high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities that are costly and challenging to scale. Current self-improving methods suffer from two key issues: (1) separate augmentation of visual or textual data causing complexity discrepancies, and (2) separated evolution of data and models leading to mismatched difficulty levels between tasks and model capabilities.

Method: C2-Evo employs two interconnected loops: (1) a cross-modal data evolution loop that generates complex multimodal problems combining structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, and (2) a data-model evolution loop that adaptively selects generated problems based on base model performance and conducts supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.

Result: The method continuously refines both model and training data, achieving considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks through the joint evolution approach.

Conclusion: C2-Evo successfully addresses the limitations of existing self-improving MLLM methods by jointly evolving data and model capabilities through automated closed-loop processes, demonstrating effective improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks while promising to make code, models, and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spatial 3D-LLM, a multimodal large language model that enhances spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks through progressive spatial embeddings and location-enriched scene representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D multimodal LLMs have limited spatial awareness because they rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects, which fails to capture the rich spatial relationships inherent in 3D scenes.

Method: The authors propose Spatial 3D-LLM which integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings as visual prompts.

Result: Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D vision-language tasks. The authors also introduce two novel evaluation tasks (3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing) and construct a 3D instruction dataset called MODEL to assess spatial awareness capabilities.

Conclusion: The progressive spatial awareness scheme successfully mines more profound spatial information, leading to improved performance on 3D vision-language tasks and demonstrating the importance of enhanced spatial embeddings for 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EarthCrafter, a framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation using a new aerial dataset (Aerial-Earth3D) with 50k scenes and a sparse-decoupled latent diffusion architecture that separates geometric and textural generation to model thousands of square kilometers of Earth's surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods cannot scale to geographic extents like modeling thousands of square kilometers of Earth's surface, which remains an open challenge in the field.

Method: The approach combines two innovations: (1) Aerial-Earth3D dataset with 50k curated 600m x 600m scenes from U.S. mainland containing multi-view images, depth maps, normals, and semantic segmentation; (2) EarthCrafter framework using dual sparse 3D-VAEs to compress geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats into compact latent spaces, plus condition-aware flow matching models for independent geometry and texture generation.

Result: EarthCrafter demonstrates substantially better performance in extremely large-scale generation compared to existing methods, supporting versatile applications including semantic-guided urban layout generation and unconditional terrain synthesis while maintaining geographic plausibility.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of large-scale 3D Earth generation through innovative data infrastructure and model architecture, enabling realistic modeling of vast geographic areas with flexible conditioning options.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

*Jon Gutiérrez-Zaballa,Koldo Basterretxea,Javier Echanobe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents optimization techniques for deploying DNN-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation on FPGA-based SoCs for autonomous driving systems, achieving significant model compression and speed improvements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical autonomous driving systems require HSI-based vision systems that can operate under strict constraints for latency, resource consumption, and security. Current DNN models are over-parameterized and computationally challenging for real-time edge deployment, while HSI data preprocessing is intensive and often overlooked in system design.

Method: The authors employ a comprehensive software/hardware co-design approach including: functional task distribution between software and hardware, hardware-aware preprocessing optimization, ML model compression techniques, and complete pipelined deployment on FPGA-based SoC platforms.

Result: The compression techniques reduced DNN complexity to 24.34% of original operations and 1.02% of original parameters, achieving 2.86x speed-up in inference tasks without noticeable degradation in segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization framework successfully enables practical deployment of DNN-based HSI segmentation systems on resource-constrained edge platforms for autonomous driving applications, demonstrating significant computational efficiency gains while preserving performance quality.

Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhaKIR, a new multi-center dataset and challenge for endoscopic surgery that combines surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument segmentation using 13 full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos to advance temporally-aware surgical scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery applications, but robust real-world performance remains challenging. Current methods lack integration of surgical context and temporal information, limiting their effectiveness in practical surgical scenarios.

Method: The authors organized the PhaKIR sub-challenge at MICCAI 2024 EndoVis challenge and created a novel multi-center dataset with 13 full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos from three medical institutions. The dataset provides unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation, enabling joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context.

Result: The paper reports challenge results following BIAS guidelines for biomedical image analysis challenges. The dataset successfully enables investigation of temporal information across entire procedures and supports development of context-driven methods that integrate surgical phase information with instrument recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The PhaKIR sub-challenge provides a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery and offers a high-quality resource for future research in surgical scene understanding by combining multiple related tasks within the same comprehensive dataset.

Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the
Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel,
multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic
cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with
unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition,
instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike
existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization
and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of
temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for
biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the
field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware,
context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support
future research in surgical scene understanding.

### [62] [A Multimodal Deviation Perceiving Framework for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16596)
*Wenbo Xu,Junyan Wu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MDP, a multimodal framework for detecting deepfake temporal forgeries using only video-level annotations, achieving performance comparable to fully-supervised methods through novel cross-modal attention and deviation perceiving loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods treat the problem as classification or temporal localization tasks that are restrictive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale for large datasets. There's a need for more efficient weakly-supervised approaches that can identify forged segments without requiring detailed temporal annotations.

Method: The paper proposes MDP (Multimodal Deviation Perceiving framework) with two key components: (1) A multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) using temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure visual-audio relevance in probabilistic embedding space, and (2) An extensible deviation perceiving loss that enlarges deviation between adjacent segments in forged samples while reducing it in genuine samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed framework effectively localizes temporal forgeries and achieves comparable performance to fully-supervised approaches across several evaluation metrics, while requiring only video-level annotations instead of detailed temporal labels.

Conclusion: The MDP framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing deepfake detection methods by providing an efficient weakly-supervised solution that can identify inter-modality deviations and precisely localize forged temporal segments, making it more scalable for large datasets.

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

*Xueming Fu,Pei Wu,Yingtai Li,Xin Luo,Zihang Jiang,Junhao Mei,Jian Lu,Gao-Jun Teng,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dyna3DGR, a novel framework combining 3D Gaussian representation with neural motion fields for accurate cardiac motion tracking in 4D CMR imaging, achieving superior performance compared to existing deep learning registration methods without requiring extensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardiac motion analysis is crucial for evaluating cardiac function, but existing methods face significant limitations: image-based approaches struggle with topological consistency or require extensive training data, while representation-based methods lose important image-level details. The homogeneous nature of myocardial tissue and lack of distinctive features make fine-grained 4D cardiac motion tracking particularly challenging.

Method: The paper proposes Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation (Dyna3DGR), which combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation with implicit neural motion field modeling. The method uses differentiable volumetric rendering to bridge continuous motion representation with image-space alignment, optimizing cardiac structure and motion simultaneously in a self-supervised manner without requiring extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC dataset show that Dyna3DGR surpasses state-of-the-art deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy while preserving both topological and temporal consistency throughout the cardiac cycle.

Conclusion: Dyna3DGR successfully addresses the limitations of existing cardiac motion tracking approaches by combining the advantages of explicit 3D representation and implicit motion modeling, achieving superior tracking accuracy without the typical requirements for extensive training data, making it a promising solution for accurate cardiac motion analysis in clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The
code will be available in https://github.com/windrise/Dyna3DGR.

### [64] [CTSL: Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning for Accurate Non-Contrast Cardiac Risk Prediction Using Cine MRIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16612)
*Haoyang Su,Shaohao Rui,Jinyi Xiang,Lianming Wu,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CTSL, a self-supervised framework that predicts Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) from contrast-free Cine MRI sequences without requiring manual segmentation masks, using codebook-based temporal-spatial learning to capture motion patterns and achieve accurate cardiac risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MACE prediction methods require supervised learning with human-refined ventricular myocardium masks and contrast agents, making them impractical for contrast-free scenarios. There is a critical need for accurate, non-invasive cardiac risk assessment that can work without contrast agents or manual segmentation.

Method: The paper proposes Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), a self-supervised framework that: (1) decouples temporal and spatial features through multi-view distillation with teacher-student models, (2) uses codebook-based feature representations, (3) employs dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, and (4) learns from raw Cine data without segmentation masks.

Result: CTSL achieves high-confidence MACE risk predictions and outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods. The framework successfully captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns from contrast-free Cine MRI sequences, providing rapid and non-invasive cardiac risk assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed CTSL framework enables timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings by providing accurate MACE prediction from contrast-free Cine MRI without requiring manual segmentation, offering a practical solution for widespread cardiac risk assessment.

Abstract: Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction
from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.

*Ang Li,Charles Wang,Kaiyu Yue,Zikui Cai,Ollie Liu,Deqing Fu,Peng Guo,Wang Bill Zhu,Vatsal Sharan,Robin Jia,Willie Neiswanger,Furong Huang,Tom Goldstein,Micah Goldblum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zebra-CoT, a large-scale dataset of 182,384 samples containing interleaved text-image reasoning traces to train multimodal models for Visual Chain of Thought reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements on various visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training multimodal models for Visual Chain of Thought is challenging due to poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance that hinders reinforcement learning and the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. Humans naturally use visual aids like diagrams when solving complex problems, so models should learn to do the same.

Method: The authors created Zebra-CoT, a diverse dataset with 182,384 samples containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces across four task categories: scientific questions (geometry, physics, algorithms), 2D visual reasoning (visual search, jigsaw puzzles), 3D reasoning (multi-hop inference, embodied/robot planning), and visual logic problems (chess, strategic games). They fine-tuned models like Anole-7B and Bagel-7B on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning Anole-7B on Zebra-CoT achieved +12% improvement in test-set accuracy and up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B produced a model capable of generating high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Zebra-CoT successfully addresses the challenges of training Visual Chain of Thought models by providing high-quality training data that enables significant performance improvements. The open-sourced dataset and models support further development and evaluation of visual CoT capabilities in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

TL;DR: ASaRG extends LLaVA architecture by integrating segmentation maps and intermediate features from specialist radiological models to improve clinical report generation performance and provide better grounding for medical assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical report generation models need strong general performance and grounding capabilities to convince clinicians and patients of generated reports' veracity, while also alleviating radiologists' workloads and providing second opinions.

Method: ASaRG fuses intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps from specialist radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple concatenation, adding only a small number of parameters to the baseline architecture.

Result: Achieved +0.89% CE F1 score improvement with intermediate features only (p=0.012) and +2.77% with combined features and segmentation maps (p<0.001) compared to LLaVA baseline. Outperformed COMG and ORID by 6.98% and 6.28% F1 score respectively.

Conclusion: ASaRG successfully improves clinical report generation performance while enabling traceability between report elements and segmentation maps for verification. The method is compatible with other LLaVA architecture modifications and demonstrates the value of incorporating specialist radiological model outputs.

Abstract: Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.

### [67] [A2Mamba: Attention-augmented State Space Models for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16624)
*Meng Lou,Yunxiang Fu,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A2Mamba introduces a novel hybrid architecture that deeply integrates Transformer and Mamba layers through a Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS), achieving state-of-the-art performance across visual recognition tasks including ImageNet classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that combine Transformer and Mamba architectures for visual recognition only perform simple stacking without interaction mechanisms between layers. Deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an unsolved problem, limiting the potential benefits of combining these complementary approaches.

Method: The paper proposes A2Mamba, featuring a Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS) token mixer. The key innovation is A2SSM, which performs cross-attention by spatially aggregating SSM's hidden states using multi-scale attention maps, enhancing spatial dependencies and improving dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs.

Result: A2Mamba achieves superior performance across multiple tasks: A2Mamba-L reaches 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% mIoU in semantic segmentation with higher efficiency, and A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m for object detection/instance segmentation while using 40% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: A2Mamba successfully addresses the limitation of shallow integration between Transformer and Mamba architectures by introducing deep interaction mechanisms through MASS, demonstrating that proper integration of these architectures can achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual recognition tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

*Jonathan Henrich,Christian Post,Maximilian Zilke,Parth Shiroya,Emma Chanut,Amir Mollazadeh Yamchi,Ramin Yahyapour,Thomas Kneib,Imke Traulsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two benchmarking datasets (PigDetect and PigTrack) for automated pig monitoring in farming, comparing various object detection and multi-object tracking methods to establish baselines for animal welfare and management applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual monitoring of individual pig behavior is labor-intensive and impractical for effective animal welfare management. While machine learning advances enable automated solutions, there lacks systematic benchmarking studies for pig detection and tracking methods, creating a gap in standardized evaluation approaches.

Method: The authors curated two datasets from realistic barn conditions: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. They systematically compared state-of-the-art detection models against real-time alternatives, and evaluated SORT-based tracking methods versus end-to-end trainable models across challenging scenarios including occlusions and poor visibility.

Result: State-of-the-art detection models significantly outperformed real-time alternatives, with challenging training images improving performance beyond random sampling. SORT-based tracking methods achieved superior detection performance, while end-to-end models showed better association capabilities. Models demonstrated good generalization to unseen environments, indicating robust training data quality.

Conclusion: The study establishes comprehensive benchmarks for pig monitoring systems, revealing that high-quality training data is crucial for generalization. While current SORT-based methods excel in detection, end-to-end models show promise for future development. The publicly available datasets and code will facilitate reproducible research and further development in automated pig farming monitoring.

Abstract: To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.

*Shuang Song,Yang Tang,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for improving building segmentation in remote sensing by re-training models at test time using synthetic data tailored to target regions, combining geospatial data from OpenStreetMap with procedural modeling and adversarial domain adaptation to overcome generalization issues without requiring extensive real-world annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for building segmentation in remote sensing struggle to generalize across diverse geographic regions due to variations in city layouts, building types, sizes, and locations. The amount of time-consuming annotated data needed to capture worldwide diversity cannot keep up with the demands of increasingly data-hungry models.

Method: The approach re-trains models at test time using geo-typical synthetic data that replicates target area urban structures by leveraging geospatial data from OpenStreetMap. It uses procedural modeling and physics-based rendering to create high-resolution synthetic images with domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and environmental illumination. The method integrates this geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework to overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. The method successfully generates virtually unlimited training samples while maintaining essential characteristics of target environments and provides a scalable, cost-effective solution.

Conclusion: This scalable and cost-effective method successfully blends partial geographic knowledge with synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue in purely synthetic datasets and offering a practical pathway to improving generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive real-world annotations.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote
sensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic
regions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building
types, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated
data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of
increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.

*Sos Agaian,Vladimir Frants*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quaternion Retinex, a novel image enhancement method that uses quaternion algebra to decompose low-light images into reflectance and illumination components, addressing key limitations of traditional Retinex models and achieving 2-11% performance improvements in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light images suffer from color shift, low contrast, and noise that hurt computer vision accuracy. Traditional Retinex models have four key flaws: treating RGB channels independently, lacking neuroscientific color vision models, inability to perfectly rebuild input images, and failure to explain human color constancy.

Method: The authors propose the first Quaternion Retinex formulation where the scene is represented as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and illumination components. They also introduce the Reflectance Consistency Index to measure how well reflectance remains invariant across different lighting conditions.

Result: Testing on low-light crack inspection, face detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion shows 2-11% performance gains over leading methods. The approach demonstrates better color fidelity, lower noise, and higher reflectance stability compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: Quaternion Retinex successfully addresses the limitations of traditional Retinex models by using quaternion algebra to better model color relationships and achieve superior performance in low-light image enhancement tasks while maintaining better reflectance consistency.

Abstract: Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.

### [71] [Enhancing Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models Through MLLM and LLM-Based High-Quality Image-Text Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16716)
*Yiguo He,Junjie Zhu,Yiying Li,Xiaoyu Zhang,Chunping Qiu,Jun Wang,Qiangjuan Huang,Ke Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MpGI, a two-stage method for generating high-quality captions for remote sensing images, creating the HQRS-IT-210K dataset with 210K images and 1.3M captions, and training improved vision-language models (HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa) that achieve SOTA performance with significantly less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, large-scale image-text paired training data for remote sensing imagery limits the performance of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs). Existing datasets suffer from suboptimal quality due to rudimentary caption generation methods, requiring larger volumes of training data while yielding only modest performance improvements.

Method: A two-stage approach called MpGI (Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration): 1) Generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods, 2) Use Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions capturing details from multiple perspectives. This creates the HQRS-IT-210K dataset with ~210K RS images and 1.3M captions.

Result: HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and generates captions for RS images that rival or exceed manual annotations. The dataset contains about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million high-quality captions.

Conclusion: The proposed MpGI method successfully addresses the challenge of generating high-quality captions for remote sensing images, resulting in superior vision-language models that achieve state-of-the-art performance with dramatically reduced training data requirements, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-perspective caption generation and integration.

Abstract: The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.

### [72] [Temporally-Constrained Video Reasoning Segmentation and Automated Benchmark Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16718)
*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Chenxiao Fan,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a new approach that can identify and segment objects in videos based on natural language queries while considering when objects become contextually relevant over time, particularly useful for surgical video analysis where instruments and anatomy change importance dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video segmentation methods are limited to predefined object categories and cannot handle out-of-vocabulary objects or complex text queries. They also assume target objects remain relevant throughout entire video sequences, which is inadequate for real-world scenarios like surgical videos where objects appear, disappear, or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context.

Method: The authors propose temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become contextually relevant based on text queries incorporating temporal reasoning. They develop an innovative automated benchmark construction method to avoid expensive manual annotation and create TCVideoRSBenchmark using videos from the MVOR dataset.

Result: The paper presents TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation dataset containing 52 samples, which enables evaluation of models that can handle temporal context in video segmentation tasks with natural language queries.

Conclusion: The work addresses a critical limitation in video segmentation by introducing temporal constraints and reasoning capabilities, offering a more flexible solution for complex scenarios like operating room video analysis where object relevance changes dynamically over time.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.

*Ying Li,Xinzhe Li,Yong Du,Yangyang Xu,Junyu Dong,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HarmonPaint is a training-free inpainting framework that integrates with diffusion model attention mechanisms to achieve high-quality, harmonized image inpainting without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inpainting methods require extensive retraining or fine-tuning to integrate new content and struggle to maintain coherence in both structure and style between inpainted regions and surrounding background.

Method: The framework leverages masking strategies within self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models to ensure structural fidelity, and exploits intrinsic diffusion model properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions for harmonious style integration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness across diverse scenes and styles, validating the framework's versatility and performance in achieving seamless inpainting integration.

Conclusion: HarmonPaint successfully addresses the limitations of existing inpainting methods by providing a training-free solution that maintains both structural and stylistic coherence in image inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Existing inpainting methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning
to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.

### [74] [DFR: A Decompose-Fuse-Reconstruct Framework for Multi-Modal Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16736)
*Shuai Chen,Fanman Meng,Xiwei Zhang,Haoran Wei,Chenhao Wu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFR is a novel framework that improves few-shot segmentation by integrating visual, textual, and audio modalities using SAM, achieving better performance than existing single or dual-modal approaches through decomposition, contrastive fusion, and dual-path reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation approaches primarily rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions with single or dual-modal paradigms, which limits their ability to exploit the rich perceptual information available in real-world multi-modal scenarios.

Method: The DFR framework consists of three key components: 1) Multi-modal Decompose - hierarchical decomposition using SAM for visual region proposals, textual semantic expansion, and audio feature processing; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse - contrastive learning-based fusion strategy for cross-modal consistency and dynamic semantic interactions; 3) Dual-path Reconstruct - adaptive integration combining tri-modal semantic guidance with multi-modal geometric cues.

Result: Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both synthetic and real settings demonstrate substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in few-shot segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The DFR framework successfully addresses the challenge of multi-modal guidance utilization in few-shot segmentation by systematically integrating three modalities through decomposition, fusion, and reconstruction, leading to enhanced semantic understanding and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

*Keneni W. Tesema,Lyndon Hill,Mark W. Jones,Gary K. L. Tam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DWCNet, a robust point cloud completion method that simultaneously denoises and completes highly corrupted partial point clouds, along with a new benchmark dataset CPCCD for evaluating robustness against real-world degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion networks trained on synthetic data struggle with real-world degradations like noise and occlusions. There's a need for methods that can handle multiple simultaneous corruptions in partial point clouds for applications in autonomous driving, AR, and robotics.

Method: The authors propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing Network) with a Noise Management Module (NMM) that uses contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and model structural relationships. They also introduce CPCCD dataset to benchmark robustness against diverse corruptions.

Result: DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both clean and corrupted datasets, demonstrating superior robustness on synthetic and real-world data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DWCNet framework effectively addresses the challenge of completing highly corrupted point clouds by integrating denoising capabilities, showing significant improvements in handling real-world degradations compared to current methods.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets. The dataset and

### [76] [CMP: A Composable Meta Prompt for SAM-Based Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16753)
*Shuai Chen,Fanman Meng,Chunjin Yang,Haoran Wei,Chenhao Wu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation by introducing three modules: RCT for semantic expansion, CMPG for automated prompt generation, and FAI for domain adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.8% and 74.5% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation faces challenges due to limited data and domain shifts. While SAM shows promise with zero-shot capabilities, it has critical limitations including reliance on manual prompts and limited cross-domain ability, creating a need for automated prompt generation and better domain adaptation.

Method: The paper introduces the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework with three key modules: (1) Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (2) Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (3) Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation.

Result: The CMP framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across four cross-domain datasets, with 71.8% mIoU in 1-shot scenarios and 74.5% mIoU in 5-shot scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in cross-domain few-shot segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CMP framework successfully addresses the limitations of SAM in cross-domain few-shot segmentation by eliminating manual prompt dependency and improving cross-domain generalization, establishing new state-of-the-art performance benchmarks in this challenging task.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to
limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability
in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot
scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges:
reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for
semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module
for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction
(FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four
cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving
71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.

### [77] [Faithful, Interpretable Chest X-ray Diagnosis with Anti-Aliased B-cos Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16761)
*Marcel Kleinmann,Shashank Agnihotri,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves B-cos networks for medical imaging by introducing anti-aliasing techniques (FLCPooling and BlurPool) to eliminate explanation artifacts and extending the method to multi-label classification, making it suitable for chest X-ray analysis where multiple abnormalities can co-occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard B-cos networks, while offering inherently interpretable explanations for deep neural networks in safety-critical medical imaging applications, suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps that make them unsuitable for clinical use. Additionally, the original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, but chest X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring abnormalities.

Method: The authors address B-cos limitations by: (1) introducing anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) techniques to improve explanation quality and eliminate artifacts, and (2) extending the B-cos network architecture to support multi-label classification scenarios commonly needed in medical imaging applications.

Result: The modified B-cos networks (B-cos_FLC and B-cos_BP) demonstrated strong predictive performance on chest X-ray datasets while providing faithful and artifact-free explanations. The anti-aliasing strategies successfully eliminated the severe aliasing artifacts present in standard B-cos explanation maps, and the multi-label extension enabled the method to handle co-occurring abnormalities in chest X-ray analysis.

Conclusion: The enhanced B-cos networks with anti-aliasing and multi-label capabilities provide a viable solution for interpretable deep learning in clinical applications, maintaining competitive diagnostic performance while offering clear, artifact-free explanations suitable for safety-critical medical imaging domains where both accuracy and interpretability are essential.

Abstract: Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the
original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest
X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring
abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce
anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to
significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to
support multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets
demonstrate that the modified $\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and
$\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing
faithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in
multi-label settings. Code available at:

*Changhao Li,Xinrui Chen,Ji Wang,Kang Zhao,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot quantization framework for object detection that generates task-specific synthetic data with bounding boxes and categories, eliminating the need for original training data while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantization methods require access to original training data, which is often restricted due to privacy and security concerns. Existing zero-shot quantization methods for object detection use generic synthetic images that lack specific object detection information, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) Bounding box and category sampling strategy to synthesize task-specific calibration data from pre-trained networks, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and category distributions without prior knowledge; (2) Integration of task-specific training into knowledge distillation to restore quantized detection network performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate efficiency and state-of-the-art performance compared to existing zero-shot quantization methods for object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed task-specific zero-shot quantization framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by generating appropriate synthetic data for object detection, achieving superior performance without requiring original training data.

Abstract: Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

*Anjith George,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining two different synthetic face datasets generated by distinct architectures to improve face recognition model performance while addressing privacy concerns of using real-world data without consent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face recognition datasets are often collected without user consent, raising ethical and privacy issues. While synthetic data offers a solution, models trained on single-generator synthetic datasets underperform due to generator-specific artifacts and overfitting to inherent biases.

Method: The authors combine two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets generated using architecturally distinct generator backbones. This fusion approach reduces model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and demographics, and provides implicit regularization by emphasizing identity-relevant features.

Result: Models trained on the combined synthetic dataset demonstrate superior performance across many standard face recognition benchmarks compared to models trained on single synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic face datasets from different generators effectively addresses limitations of single-generator approaches, achieving better face recognition performance while maintaining privacy and ethical standards by avoiding unconsented real-world data.

Abstract: While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.

*Dong Liang,Jinyuan Jia,Yuhao Liu,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HOComp, a method for compositing foreground objects onto human-centric background images while ensuring natural human-object interactions, along with the first dataset IHOC for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-guided composition methods struggle to synthesize seamless interaction-aware compositions when dealing with human-object interactions, often failing to achieve natural blending and harmonious interactions between foreground objects and background humans.

Method: HOComp uses two key components: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG) that identifies interaction regions and types to provide pose constraints, and (2) Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP) that employs shape-aware attention modulation, multi-view appearance loss, and background consistency loss to maintain consistent appearances.

Result: HOComp effectively generates harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances and outperforms relevant methods both qualitatively and quantitatively on the proposed IHOC dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed HOComp method successfully addresses the challenge of interaction-aware human-object composition by incorporating pose guidance and appearance preservation mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance on the newly introduced IHOC dataset.

Abstract: While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkAct is a dual-system framework that separates high-level reasoning from low-level action execution in vision-language-action tasks, using a multimodal LLM to generate reasoning plans that are compressed into visual latents to guide action models, enabling better few-shot adaptation and long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models train end-to-end by directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which limits their ability to perform multi-step planning and adapt to complex task variations in dynamic environments.

Method: ThinkAct uses a dual-system framework that trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans using reinforced visual latent planning with action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into visual plan latents that condition a downstream action model for execution.

Result: Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks show that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Conclusion: The dual-system approach of separating reasoning from action execution through reinforced visual latent planning successfully improves VLA model performance on complex embodied AI tasks, demonstrating superior planning capabilities and adaptability compared to end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Diligent Learner, a new learning paradigm that models reasoning as depth-first search with validation and backtracking, which can efficiently learn from Chain-of-Thought data where existing methods fail, enabling the development of Large Reasoning Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought reasoning approaches (SFT, RL, ToT, MCTS) often fail on complex reasoning tasks due to core obstacles including distribution drift, lack of embedded search, and exponential inference costs. The theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped.

Method: The Diligent Learner paradigm explicitly models reasoning as a depth-first search process guided by a validator with support for backtracking upon failure. The method operates under two mild and realistic assumptions to enable efficient learning from CoT data.

Result: Under the specified assumptions, the authors prove that the Diligent Learner can efficiently learn from Chain-of-Thought data while existing methods fail to achieve this. The framework enables training on naturally occurring, incomplete data.

Conclusion: The Diligent Learner framework provides a path toward building scalable and reliable reasoning systems that can be trained on incomplete data, paving the way for developing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust and interpretable problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing
the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and
existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement
Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --
often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles
that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of
embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent
Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a
depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon
failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent
Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do
so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable

TL;DR: This paper presents an optimization approach for meat processing companies to efficiently purchase and process materials, addressing real-world constraints like minimum order quantities and expiration dates using iterative integer linear programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The meat production industry faces escalating challenges due to the European Union energy crisis, making efficient use of input materials crucial for company profitability. Existing literature focuses on supply chain management rather than the production stage optimization.

Method: The authors develop a simple iterative approach based on integer linear programming to solve the optimization problem. They prove that minimum order quantity and minimum percentage constraints make the problem NP-hard, then design their algorithm to handle real-life instances using open-source solvers.

Result: The algorithm successfully finds optimal solutions within seconds for all considered use cases using real data from a meat processing company. The approach also mitigates numerical issues caused by extensive data value ranges that were problematic with commercial solvers.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative integer linear programming approach effectively solves the meat processing optimization problem with practical constraints, demonstrating fast computation times and numerical stability for real-world applications.

Abstract: The food production industry, especially the meat production sector, faces
many challenges that have even escalated due to the recent outbreak of the
energy crisis in the European Union. Therefore, efficient use of input
materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This
paper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent
material processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the
majority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns
supply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The
problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock
of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely
neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the
minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints
makes the problem \mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple
iterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve
real-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming
solver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical
issues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a
commercial solver. The results obtained using real data from the meat
processing company showed that our algorithm can find the optimum solution in a
few seconds for all considered use cases.

TL;DR: A novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and classify driving scenarios, particularly focusing on braking events to identify safety-critical corner cases in ADAS vehicle data, with dual-path retrieval for both known and unknown scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying safety-critical corner cases in the vast amount of routine driving data from ADAS-equipped vehicles. Existing rule-based approaches lack generalization in complex urban environments, creating a need for better scenario understanding and reasoning capabilities to answer "Why does a vehicle brake?"

Method: A novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that bridges low-level numerical signals and natural language descriptions for driving scenario interpretation. The approach includes a dual-path scenario retrieval system supporting both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios.

Result: The proposed method outperforms rule-based baselines and demonstrates good generalization to Out-of-Distribution scenarios. Evaluation was conducted using curated scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-based frameworks can effectively interpret and classify driving scenarios by connecting numerical sensor data with natural language understanding, providing superior performance over traditional rule-based methods and better handling of complex urban driving situations and unknown scenarios.

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase
in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying
and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains
a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of
potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our
research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on
rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition
filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods
lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario
understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level
numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret
and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that
supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based
retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate
evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and
generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

### [85] [Differential Multimodal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15875)
*Jerry Li,Timothy Oh,Joseph Hoang,Vardhit Veeramachaneni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends Differential Attention mechanism from text-only models to multimodal text-vision models (PaliGemma) to reduce noise and hallucinations in vision-language tasks by improving attention focus on relevant contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models face challenges with limited context windows when incorporating vision modalities, as additional visual information introduces noise. Transformer attention mechanisms often focus disproportionately on irrelevant contexts, leading to poor information retrieval and hallucinations in multimodal settings.

Method: The authors extended the Differential Attention mechanism (originally designed for text-only models) to the text-vision model PaliGemma 3B. They used LoRA fine-tuning to incorporate Differential Attention and experimented with various parameter settings and configurations to optimize performance.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that Differential Attention can be successfully adapted and integrated into existing multimodal models through fine-tuning, showing improved performance in noisy information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

Conclusion: Differential Attention mechanism can be effectively extended to multimodal text-vision models to enhance their ability to filter out irrelevant information and reduce hallucinations, proving its adaptability beyond text-only applications.

Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their
efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional
modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context
windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer
attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In
this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed
for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to
evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce
hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA,
incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter
settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be
adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy
information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

*Eric Benhamou,Jean-Jacques Ohana,Alban Etienne,Béatrice Guez,Ethan Setrouk,Thomas Jacquot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different time horizons in trend-following strategies affect CTA performance by decomposing returns into short-term trend, long-term trend, and market beta factors using Bayesian modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The relative merits and interactions between short-term versus long-term trend-following systems in CTA strategies remain controversial and poorly understood, despite extensive research on trend following.

Method: Dynamic decomposition of CTA returns into three factors (short-term trend, long-term trend, and market beta) using a Bayesian graphical model to analyze the contributions of different time horizons.

Result: The study demonstrates how different blends of short-term and long-term trend horizons impact the risk-adjusted performance of CTA strategies.

Conclusion: The blend of different time horizons in trend-following strategies significantly shapes the strategy's risk-adjusted performance, providing insights into optimizing CTA performance through horizon selection.

Abstract: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have historically relied on trend-following
rules that operate on vastly different horizons from long-term breakouts that
capture major directional moves to short-term momentum signals that thrive in
fast-moving markets. Despite a large body of work on trend following, the
relative merits and interactions of short-versus long-term trend systems remain
controversial. This paper adds to the debate by (i) dynamically decomposing CTA
returns into short-term trend, long-term trend and market beta factors using a
Bayesian graphical model, and (ii) showing how the blend of horizons shapes the
strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

*Simon Ouellette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning (TTFT) approaches on ARC-AGI compositional generalization tasks, finding that execution-guided neural program synthesis performs better at creating novel solutions while TTFT mainly helps models access existing knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate different approaches for compositional generalization in open-world problem domains where out-of-distribution generalization is essential, using ARC-AGI as a controlled experimental setting.

Method: Conducted a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI domain, comparing neural program synthesis (specifically execution-guided approaches) against test-time fine-tuning methods on novel problem composition tasks.

Result: Execution-guided neural program synthesis outperformed all reference algorithms in composing novel solutions. Test-time fine-tuning's success on ARC-AGI was found to primarily stem from eliciting in-distribution knowledge that LLMs fail to utilize directly.

Conclusion: Neural program synthesis with execution guidance is superior for compositional generalization in open-world domains, while test-time fine-tuning mainly helps access existing model knowledge rather than enabling true novel composition.

Abstract: We run a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI
domain: an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize
out-of-distribution is, by design, an essential characteristic for success. We
compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this
experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms
all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our
empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly
in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on
directly.

### [88] [The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15880)
*Andy E. Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP), arguing that intelligence systems require structural coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively, and proposes the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known operator that can maintain this coherence at any scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems experience issues like misalignment, hallucination, and instability when scaling up. The authors argue these problems stem from a fundamental lack of structural coherence in recursive reasoning processes. As complex systems grow, maintaining semantic consistency becomes increasingly fragile without proper higher-order structure.

Method: The paper formally defines the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP) as a foundational constraint for reasoning systems. They propose the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as a minimal, composable architecture with specific internal functions (evaluation, modeling, adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions (storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) designed to preserve semantic structure across inference and coordination layers.

Result: The authors prove that any system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it scales. They demonstrate that the FMI is the only known operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale, and show that common AI problems are symptoms of structural coherence loss rather than isolated issues.

Conclusion: The work advocates for a paradigm shift in AI alignment from behavioral constraints to structural coherence. The RCP and FMI framework provides a pathway for developing safely generalizable and robustly coherent AI systems at scale, offering a foundational approach to address fundamental scaling challenges in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural
coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex
systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures
semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle
(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order
N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic
coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator
that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this
coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system
can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We
formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known
operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,
composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,
adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions
(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving
semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any
system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it
scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and
instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other
foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics
needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under
recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift
from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for
safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.

*Pierluca D'Oro,Caley Drooff,Joy Chen,Joseph Tighe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADEPTS, a capability framework that defines six core user-facing principles for developing human-centered AI agents, bridging the gap between technical development and user experience design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current guidance for AI agent development is fragmented across UX heuristics, engineering taxonomies, and ethics checklists, lacking a unified, user-facing vocabulary that defines what agents should fundamentally be able to do for human-centered design.

Method: The authors developed ADEPTS, a capability framework based on six principles for human-centered agent design that expresses minimal user-facing capabilities needed for AI agents to be understandable, controllable, and trustworthy in everyday use.

Result: ADEPTS provides a compact framework that sits at the interface between technical and experience development, offering actionable guidance for AI researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers while complementing existing frameworks and taxonomies.

Conclusion: ADEPTS has the potential to accelerate improvement of user-relevant agent capabilities, ease the design of experiences leveraging those capabilities, and provide a shared language for tracking and discussing AI agent development progress.

Abstract: Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents,
assisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This
flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and
cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the
capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current
guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics
focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal
pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no
concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should
fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework
defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance
around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for
human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities
an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and
trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and
taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical
and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex
AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI
researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe
ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent
capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those
capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress
around the development of AI agents.

### [90] [Integrating Reason-Based Moral Decision-Making in the Reinforcement Learning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15895)
*Lisa Dargasz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reason-Based Artificial Moral Agents (RBAMAs), an extension of reinforcement learning that enables AI agents to make ethical decisions through normative reasoning and case-based learning, addressing the need for moral behavior in autonomous systems transitioning to real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents like humanoid robots and autonomous cars transition from laboratory prototypes to real-world autonomous operation, there is an urgent need to ensure these systems behave ethically. Current reinforcement learning approaches lack the capability for moral decision-making, creating concerns about deploying increasingly capable autonomous agents without ethical safeguards.

Method: The paper develops RBAMAs by extending the reinforcement learning architecture with moral reasoning capabilities. The agents learn a "reason-theory" through case-based feedback that enables them to process morally relevant propositions and derive moral obligations. The architecture allows agents to adapt their behavior to conform to these moral obligations while pursuing their designated tasks.

Result: The study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and demonstrates its potential through initial experiments. The framework shows promise for creating artificial moral agents that exhibit moral justifiability, moral robustness, and moral trustworthiness in their decision-making processes.

Conclusion: RBAMAs provide a concrete and deployable framework for developing artificial moral agents that fulfill key ethical requirements. The extended reinforcement learning architecture successfully integrates normative reasoning capabilities, offering a viable solution for ensuring ethical behavior in autonomous systems as they transition to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has
demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it
plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As
these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly
approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid
robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes
to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises
concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the
requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research
directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave
ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a
range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.
This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents
(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning
architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative
reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn
a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant
propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They
are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these
obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute
to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and
their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a
concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key
ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and
demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

TL;DR: This paper surveys ethical challenges of proactive AI agents in smart homes, focusing on privacy, fairness, and user control, with special attention to vulnerable populations like elderly, children, and neurodivergent users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from reactive to proactive autonomous AI agents in household environments creates new ethical challenges including surveillance risks, bias, and privacy concerns, particularly for vulnerable user groups who need special protection and consideration.

Method: Literature review and analysis of responsible innovation frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices. The study examines vulnerable user groups and explores data-driven insights including social media analysis via Natural Language Processing to understand user needs and ethical concerns.

Result: The research identifies key design imperatives including tailored explainability mechanisms, granular consent systems, and robust override controls. It highlights the need for participatory and inclusive methodologies when developing agentic AI systems for households.

Conclusion: The paper provides both conceptual foundations and practical recommendations for developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household automation, emphasizing the importance of addressing ethical challenges through responsible design practices.

Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household environments,
especially in the form of proactive autonomous agents, brings about
possibilities of comfort and attention as well as it comes with intra or
extramural ethical challenges. This article analyzes agentic AI and its
applications, focusing on its move from reactive to proactive autonomy,
privacy, fairness and user control. We review responsible innovation
frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to
distill practical guidance for ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user
groups such as elderly individuals, children, and neurodivergent who face
higher risks of surveillance, bias, and privacy risks were studied in detail in
context of Agentic AI. Design imperatives are highlighted such as tailored
explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls,
supported by participatory and inclusive methodologies. It was also explored
how data-driven insights, including social media analysis via Natural Language
Processing(NLP), can inform specific user needs and ethical concerns. This
survey aims to provide both a conceptual foundation and suggestions for
developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household
automation.

### [92] [Does More Inference-Time Compute Really Help Robustness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15974)
*Tong Wu,Chong Xiang,Jiachen T. Wang,Weichen Yu,Chawin Sitawarin,Vikash Sehwag,Prateek Mittal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines inference-time scaling in LLMs, showing that while it improves robustness when reasoning steps are hidden, it actually reduces robustness when intermediate steps are accessible to adversaries, revealing critical security implications for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work showed that inference-time computation improves robustness in large proprietary LLMs, but this relied on the implicit assumption that intermediate reasoning steps remain hidden from adversaries. The authors aim to test this assumption and examine the security implications when reasoning steps become accessible.

Method: The researchers used budget forcing strategy to test inference-time scaling on smaller open-source models (DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, Phi-reasoning). They then relaxed the hidden reasoning assumption and empirically tested model robustness when intermediate reasoning steps are explicitly accessible to adversaries, identifying an inverse scaling law.

Result: They found that smaller open-source models can benefit from inference-time scaling when reasoning is hidden. However, when intermediate reasoning steps become accessible, increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness - demonstrating an inverse scaling law. They also identified practical attack scenarios even for models with supposedly hidden reasoning chains.

Conclusion: The robustness benefits of inference-time scaling are heavily dependent on the adversarial setting and deployment context. The authors recommend that practitioners carefully consider these security trade-offs before implementing inference-time scaling in security-sensitive real-world applications, as the benefits may not hold when reasoning steps can be accessed by adversaries.

Abstract: Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time
computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this
paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1,
Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a
simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically
examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are
hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important
security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse
scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,
increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.
Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning
chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated
reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively
demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend
heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge
practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying
inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.

*Xi Yang,Jiachen Wang,Song Han,Suining He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BikeMAN is a multi-level spatio-temporal attention neural network that predicts bike station-level traffic for entire bike sharing systems, achieving high accuracy on NYC's 700+ station network with over 10 million trips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban bike sharing systems face efficiency challenges due to unbalanced station-level demand and supply, making system maintenance difficult. Existing prediction methods struggle with the spatial-temporal complexity and large scale of entire bike sharing systems with hundreds of stations.

Method: The authors propose BikeMAN, a neural network with encoder-decoder architecture featuring dual attention mechanisms: one for capturing spatial correlations between bike stations and another for modeling temporal characteristics of station traffic patterns.

Result: The network demonstrated high accuracy in predicting bike station traffic across all stations in New York City's bike sharing system, validated on a dataset containing over 10 million trips from more than 700 stations.

Conclusion: BikeMAN successfully addresses the challenge of station-level traffic prediction for entire bike sharing systems by effectively modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling better system efficiency and maintenance planning.

Abstract: Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is
challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes
the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have
been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and
return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level
traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of
bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike
sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations.
To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention
neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing
systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an
attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of
bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the
temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on
over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York
City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic
of all stations in the city.

*Tehseen Rug,Felix Böhmer,Tessa Pfattheicher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework to understand classical computation versus LLM-based problem solving, proposing metrics to evaluate natural language solutions that inherently involve ambiguity and subjectivity, unlike binary formal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical computation excels at formal, rule-based problems but cannot address human problems characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments, and subjective context. LLMs represent a paradigm shift enabling computational engagement with these previously inaccessible domains using natural language.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework contrasting formal vs natural language problem spaces, introduce a vector-valued trust index Q for solution quality evaluation, and propose two statistical quality dimensions: normalized bi-semantic entropy (measuring robustness and conceptual diversity) and emotional valence (quantifying subjective solution valuation).

Result: The framework successfully distinguishes binary correctness of formal solutions from the continuous adequacy spectrum of natural language solutions, providing quantifiable metrics for evaluating LLM performance on ambiguous, subjective problems through the trust index and statistical quality measures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a more rigorous understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations in problem-solving, offering tools to evaluate natural language solutions that account for inherent vagueness, subjectivity, and ambiguity, thus bridging the gap between formal and natural language computational paradigms.

Abstract: Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the
engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be
described with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean
of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,
and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language
Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to
engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This
paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these
problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces
addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the
former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter
requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking
into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural
language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects
solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions
from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language
solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality
dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual
diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.
Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable
metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts
introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the
capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) to support negation in clause bodies while unifying various existing extensions (fuzzy constraints, uncertainty, etc.) using semiring-based semantics and approximation fixpoint theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLP extensions (fuzzy constraints, uncertainty, negation) have been developed separately and none have studied clauses with negation in the body. There's a need for a unifying framework that captures these approaches while supporting more expressive language features like negation in clause bodies.

Method: The authors use semiring abstractions as a unifying framework and employ approximation fixpoint theory to provide semantics for CLP programs with negation in clause bodies. They analyze how different semiring properties impact the resulting semantics.

Result: The paper successfully develops a unifying framework that captures existing CLP extensions and provides formal semantics for programs with negation in clause bodies. They provide detailed analysis of how semiring properties affect the semantics.

Conclusion: The work establishes a comprehensive unifying framework for CLP extensions that supports negation in clause bodies, enabling more expressive constraint logic programming while maintaining theoretical foundations through semiring-based semantics and approximation fixpoint theory.

Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a logic programming formalism used to
solve problems requiring the consideration of constraints, like resource
allocation and automated planning and scheduling. It has previously been
extended in various directions, for example to support fuzzy constraint
satisfaction, uncertainty, or negation, with different notions of semiring
being used as a unifying abstraction for these generalizations. None of these
extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We
investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and
allows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the
framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the
impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics. As such, we
provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows
extending them with a more expressive language.

TL;DR: Researchers developed ChatBattery, an AI framework that uses large language models with chain-of-thought reasoning and domain knowledge to discover new battery materials, successfully identifying three novel lithium-ion cathode materials with 18.5-28.8% capacity improvements over existing materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models have shown strong reasoning capabilities in math and coding, their potential for domain-specific applications like materials discovery remains largely unexplored. The researchers aimed to demonstrate how LLM reasoning could be applied to battery materials design by integrating domain knowledge to guide the reasoning process.

Method: The researchers developed ChatBattery, an agentic framework that integrates domain knowledge with large language models to guide chain-of-thought reasoning for materials design. The framework steers LLMs toward more effective reasoning in battery materials discovery by treating reasoning as a form of guided search.

Result: ChatBattery successfully identified, synthesized, and characterized three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials that achieved practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5% respectively over the widely used NMC811 cathode material. This demonstrates a complete AI-driven cycle from design to synthesis to characterization.

Conclusion: ChatBattery demonstrates the transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in materials discovery, establishing a new path for LLM-driven, reasoning-based platforms in battery materials invention. The successful complete AI cycle from design to characterization shows how AI reasoning can revolutionize materials discovery beyond traditional math and coding applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to
tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in
artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have
primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their
potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely
unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided
search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates
domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials
design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and
characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve
practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over
the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this
discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and
reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete
AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the
transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials
discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TaxCalcBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI models' ability to calculate personal income taxes, finding that state-of-the-art models succeed in less than one-third of cases due to errors in tax table usage, calculations, and eligibility determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with complex real-world tasks that require understanding vast amounts of English text and precise computation. Personal income tax calculation represents a challenging testbed that combines natural language understanding with accurate mathematical reasoning, making it an important benchmark for evaluating AI capabilities in practical applications.

Method: The authors developed TaxCalcBench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating models' abilities to calculate personal income tax returns. They tested state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark using simplified sample tax return scenarios that provided all necessary information for tax calculation.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieved less than 33% success rate in correctly calculating federal income tax returns. The analysis revealed three main types of errors: consistent misuse of tax tables, computational errors in tax calculations, and incorrect determination of tax eligibility criteria.

Conclusion: The poor performance of current AI models on tax calculation tasks highlights significant limitations in their ability to handle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks that combine language understanding with precise computation. The findings indicate that additional infrastructure and improvements are needed before LLMs can be reliably applied to personal income tax calculation tasks.

Abstract: Can AI file your taxes? Not yet. Calculating US personal income taxes is a
task that requires building an understanding of vast amounts of English text
and using that knowledge to carefully compute results. We propose TaxCalcBench,
a benchmark for determining models' abilities to calculate personal income tax
returns given all of the necessary information. Our experiment shows that
state-of-the-art models succeed in calculating less than a third of federal
income tax returns even on this simplified sample set. Our analysis concludes
that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and
incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for
additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation
task.

### [98] [SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145)
*Shuhao Mei,Yongchao Long,Shan Cao,Xiaobo Han,Shijia Geng,Jinbo Sun,Yuxi Zhou,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpiroLLM is the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirograms for COPD diagnosis, combining respiratory curve analysis with numerical PFT values to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports with 89.8% AUROC accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for COPD diagnosis lack explainability and only provide classification results without rationale, while existing LLMs cannot understand spirograms, limiting clinical trust and adoption in respiratory disease diagnosis.

Method: The approach uses SpiroEncoder to extract morphological features from respiratory curves, SpiroProjector to align them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space, and integrates these with a large language model to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports using 234,028 UK Biobank individuals.

Result: SpiroLLM achieved diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132) and maintained 100% valid response rate in robustness tests with missing data, compared to only 13.4% for text-only models.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates significant potential for fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools in respiratory disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals
from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large
language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological
features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT
numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately
empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic
report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC
of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,
it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a
text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This
work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological
signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next
generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

### [99] [Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind (A Position Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16184)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers discovered that their practical AI agent architecture called "Agentic Flow" unintentionally converged with four major theories of mind (Kahneman's dual-system, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind), achieving 95.8% task success compared to 62.3% for baseline LLMs, and introduced PEACE as a meta-architecture framework to describe this convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors were motivated by limitations in large language models (LLMs) and aimed to create a better AI agent architecture. They discovered an unexpected structural convergence between their practical design and established cognitive theories, leading them to explore how implementation demands might naturally surface theoretical structures without intentional top-down design.

Method: The researchers developed Agentic Flow, an AI agent architecture with five interdependent modules (Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action) arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. They conducted comparative experiments between their structured agent and baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks, then analyzed the structural similarities with four theories of mind and introduced PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture framework.

Result: Agentic Flow achieved 95.8% task success rate with strong constraint adherence, significantly outperforming the baseline LLM system's 62.3% success rate. The architecture showed unexpected alignment with computational motifs from all four cognitive theories, including predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control, despite being originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark's theories.

Conclusion: The study suggests that practical implementation demands may naturally lead to architectures that echo established cognitive theories, rather than requiring explicit theoretical guidance. The authors propose this as evidence that structural convergence can emerge from bottom-up design choices, and introduce PEACE as a useful descriptive framework for understanding such architectures, while emphasizing this is exploratory work rather than a claim of theoretical unification.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential
theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive
processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging
unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow.
Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow
comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control,
Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally
inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively
aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including
predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with
baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent
achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while
the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed
at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may
emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures
design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new
theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures
shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a
position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface
latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical
unification.

### [100] [CHIMERA: Compressed Hybrid Intelligence for Twin-Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16204)
*Li-Hsiang Shen,Jyun-Jhe Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) enhanced with multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) that can reflect, amplify, and harvest energy to address LEO satellite energy shortages, using a novel CHIMERA deep reinforcement learning framework to optimize energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellites operating in shadowed regions face energy shortages, and existing communication networks lack integrated optimization across space, air, and ground layers while considering both communication and computing energy consumption.

Method: The authors develop a CHIMERA (Compressed Hybrid Intelligence for Twin-model Enhanced Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning) framework that jointly optimizes MF-RIS parameters (signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, active element selection) and SAGIN parameters (beamforming vectors, HAPS deployment, user association, computing capability) to maximize long-term energy efficiency.

Result: The proposed CHIMERA scheme significantly outperforms conventional benchmarks including fixed-configuration MF-RIS, traditional RIS, no-RIS cases, and other deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of energy efficiency. The SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior performance compared to standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

Conclusion: The integrated SAGIN architecture with MF-RIS technology and CHIMERA optimization framework provides an effective solution for addressing energy constraints in space communications while achieving superior energy efficiency through complementary coverage across multiple network layers.

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed,
empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS)
capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless
energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while
explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption
across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we
formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including
signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element
selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude
platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability.
The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed
discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid
intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and
parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore
suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the
proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks,
including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and
no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed
SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its
complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone
satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

### [101] [Distilled Large Language Model in Confidential Computing Environment for System-on-Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16226)
*Dong Ben,Hui Feng,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) performance in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) using Intel TDX for secure circuit design applications, finding that distilled and quantized models perform significantly better in resource-constrained secure environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in circuit design but require protection of confidential intellectual property (IP) including trained models and training data. Existing TEE implementations are not optimized for resource-intensive LLMs, creating a need to evaluate and optimize LLM performance in secure confidential computing environments.

Method: The authors conducted comprehensive performance evaluation across three environments: TEE-based (Intel TDX), CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations. They tested various models including distilled models (DeepSeek) and quantized versions (4-bit and 8-bit quantization) measuring tokens per second performance. They validated results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.

Result: Distilled models like DeepSeek outperformed other models due to smaller parameter counts. Quantized models (Q4 and Q8) achieved up to 3x performance improvement compared to FP16 models. For smaller parameter sets like DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperformed CPU-only versions in secure computation execution.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications within secure environments. The findings show that model optimization techniques like distillation and quantization are crucial for achieving acceptable performance in TEE-based confidential computing scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks
and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained
models and their associated training data are considered confidential
intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential
Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations
are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.
In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a
TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel
Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three
environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and
evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.
  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other
models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for
resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit
quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain
of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer
parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms
the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We
further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.
These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying
lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD
applications.

*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Qiwei Han,Raquel Norel,Julia Liu,Thaddeus Stappenbeck,Jeffrey L. Rogers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Agent PULSE, an LLM-powered voice assistant for healthcare that demonstrates cost-effective patient monitoring and preventive care, showing 70% patient acceptance in a pilot study with inflammatory bowel disease patients and potential for bridging healthcare accessibility gaps in underserved populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare faces economic and accessibility gaps in digital health delivery, particularly in underserved populations where human intervention is economically unfeasible. There's a need for scalable, cost-effective solutions for preventive care and continuous patient monitoring that can enhance patient engagement while maintaining quality care.

Method: Development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and Liaison Support Engine) - a collaborative LLM-powered voice assistant created by IBM Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine. The study involved 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients and included economic modeling, cost-utility analysis, and evaluation of technical challenges including real-time conversational AI processing, healthcare system integration, and privacy compliance.

Result: 70% of patients expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37% preferring it over traditional modalities. The cost-utility analysis demonstrated significant potential savings for routine monitoring tasks. Technical and policy challenges were identified including real-time processing requirements, system integration complexities, privacy compliance, regulation needs, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy considerations.

Conclusion: AI-driven voice agents can enhance healthcare scalability, efficiency, patient engagement, and accessibility. They represent a critical entry point for equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions when developed within appropriate ethical and regulatory frameworks. The technology shows promise for cost-effective healthcare delivery where traditional human intervention is economically challenging.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a
transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital
health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model
(LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous
patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights
from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and
Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research,
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an
economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective
healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our
pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\%
expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over
traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time
conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy
compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding
regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that
AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency
but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare
executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for
routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to
prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing
current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory
frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for
equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

*Tianze Xu,Pengrui Lu,Lyumanshan Ye,Xiangkun Hu,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ResearcherBench, the first benchmark to evaluate Deep AI Research Systems (DARS) on frontier AI scientific questions, featuring 65 expert-selected research questions across 35 AI subjects with a dual evaluation framework combining rubric and factual assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks only evaluate AI research systems as basic web retrieval and report generation agents, failing to assess their potential for discovering novel insights in frontier scientific research. There's a need for proper evaluation of advanced AI systems' capabilities in scientific discovery and research tasks.

Method: The authors compiled a dataset of 65 research questions from real-world scientific scenarios spanning 35 AI subjects, categorized into technical details, literature review, and open consulting. They developed a dual evaluation framework: (1) rubric assessment using expert-designed criteria for insight quality, and (2) factual assessment measuring citation accuracy and coverage.

Result: OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep Research significantly outperformed other commercial DARS and baseline systems, with particular strength in open-ended consulting questions. The benchmark successfully differentiated system capabilities across different types of research questions.

Conclusion: ResearcherBench provides a standardized platform for evaluating next-generation AI research assistants and represents a meaningful step toward AI self-improvement. The benchmark opens new perspectives for AI research evaluation and promotes scientific collaboration between humans and AI systems.

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in
problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks.
However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web
retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel
insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we
introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the
capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI
Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a
dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific
scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different
AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature
review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric
assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality,
with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and
coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and
baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep
Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in
open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step
toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI. We
open-source ResearcherBench to provide a standardized platform for promoting
the development of next-generation AI research assistants, hoping to foster a
new perspective in AI research evaluation for a novel pattern of scientific
collaboration: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ResearcherBench.

### [104] [Cross-Modal Distillation For Widely Differing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16296)
*Cairong Zhao,Yufeng Jin,Zifan Song,Haonan Chen,Duoqian Miao,Guosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cross-modal distillation framework that uses soft constraints and adaptive weights to transfer knowledge from teacher models to student models across different modalities (image, text, speech), addressing overfitting issues in multi-modal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning performance improvement through model scaling is inefficient, and multi-modal learning faces challenges due to limited access to multi-modal data during deployment and overfitting issues caused by large domain gaps between different modalities in knowledge distillation.

Method: The authors develop a cross-modal distillation framework with: (1) soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at feature and classifier levels to replace hard constraints like L2 loss, and (2) a quality-based adaptive weights module that weights input samples based on quantified data quality for robust training.

Result: Experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks demonstrate effective knowledge transfer between image, text, and speech modalities, showing the framework's ability to handle widely differing modalities successfully.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal distillation framework with soft constraints and adaptive weighting successfully addresses overfitting in multi-modal knowledge transfer, enabling effective learning across diverse modalities while maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or
efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the
model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer
and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited
access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning
by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a
student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via
distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely
differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce
a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained
loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can
easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we
propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature
level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a
quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified
data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on
speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that
our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the
commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study reveals that existing medical LLM benchmarks inadequately represent African disease burdens and healthcare contexts, and introduces Alama Health QA, a new benchmark anchored on Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines that better captures neglected tropical diseases and regional healthcare needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLM benchmarks primarily reflect examination syllabi and disease profiles from high-income settings, raising concerns about their validity for African deployment where diseases like malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell disease, and neglected tropical diseases dominate the healthcare burden and where national guidelines drive clinical care.

Method: The researchers systematically reviewed 31 quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019-May 2025) to identify 19 English medical QA benchmarks. They developed Alama Health QA using a retrieval augmented generation framework based on Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines. Six benchmark sets underwent harmonized semantic profiling (measuring NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural fit.

Result: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora and showed the highest frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB (5.2%). AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global benchmarks showed minimal representation of African diseases (e.g., sickle cell disease was absent in three benchmark sets). Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for clinical relevance and guideline alignment, while PubMedQA scored lowest for clinical utility.

Conclusion: Widely used quantitative medical LLM benchmarks significantly underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, potentially leading to misleading performance claims. Guideline-anchored, regionally curated resources like Alama Health QA and expanded disease-specific derivatives are essential for safe and equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health systems.

Abstract: Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination
syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about
their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell
disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and
national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31
quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English
medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval
augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice
Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA,
MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized
semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity
metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance,
guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural
fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora
and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB
(5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global
benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in
three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for
relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.
Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature
underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking
misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources
such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential
for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance Generative Flow Models by incorporating higher geometric structures and symmetries through the extension from Lie Algebra to L∞-algebra, which can capture more complex mathematical relationships in the modeling framework.

Method: The method involves developing Higher Gauge Flow Models by leveraging L∞-algebra as an extension of ordinary Lie Algebra used in Gauge Flow Models, enabling the integration of higher geometry and higher symmetries associated with higher groups into the generative modeling framework.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a Gaussian Mixture Model dataset showed substantial performance improvements compared to traditional Flow Models, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating higher geometric structures.

Conclusion: Higher Gauge Flow Models successfully extend the capabilities of ordinary Gauge Flow Models through L∞-algebra, providing a more powerful framework for generative modeling that can capture higher-order geometric and symmetric properties, leading to improved performance in practical applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces Higher Gauge Flow Models, a novel class of Generative
Flow Models. Building upon ordinary Gauge Flow Models (arXiv:2507.13414), these
Higher Gauge Flow Models leverage an L$_{\infty}$-algebra, effectively
extending the Lie Algebra. This expansion allows for the integration of the
higher geometry and higher symmetries associated with higher groups into the
framework of Generative Flow Models. Experimental evaluation on a Gaussian

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A collaborative bandit algorithm was developed to optimize call timing for India's Kilkari maternal health program, achieving significantly higher call pick-up rates compared to random scheduling in a field trial with 6,500 participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India's Kilkari program delivers maternal health information via voice calls to millions of mothers, but random call scheduling leads to missed calls and reduced message delivery effectiveness. There was a need to optimize call timing to improve engagement and health outcomes.

Method: The researchers deployed a collaborative bandit algorithm that learns individual mothers' preferred call times to optimize scheduling. They conducted a field trial comparing this personalized approach against the baseline random calling method with approximately 6,500 Kilkari participants.

Result: The bandit algorithm achieved statistically significant improvements in call pick-up rates compared to the random scheduling baseline, demonstrating better message delivery performance in the pilot study.

Conclusion: Personalized scheduling using machine learning can significantly enhance mobile health intervention effectiveness. The collaborative bandit approach shows promise for scaling maternal health outreach to impact millions of mothers across India by improving call engagement rates.

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver
health information, particularly targeting underserved communities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate
crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes
through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program
delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions
of mothers. However, the current random call scheduling often results in missed
calls and reduced message delivery. This study presents a field trial of a
collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize call timing by learning
individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around
$6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the
baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm,
indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of
mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized
scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of
machine learning to improve maternal health outreach at scale.

### [108] [Canonical Representations of Markovian Structural Causal Models: A Framework for Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16370)
*Lucas de Lara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes counterfactual models as an alternative to structural causal models for representing counterfactual reasoning in Pearl's causal framework, allowing analysts to choose different counterfactual conceptions without altering observational and interventional constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many counterfactual statements cannot be falsified even by randomized experiments, yet they underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. There is a need for better models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs in causal reasoning, particularly in the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal framework.

Method: The authors introduce counterfactual models (canonical representations of structural causal models) that use random-process probability distributions with preassigned marginals to characterize counterfactual equivalence classes. They present a normalization procedure to describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions while preserving observational and interventional constraints.

Result: The proposed counterfactual models enable specification of many counterfactual conceptions without altering observational and interventional constraints. The counterfactual layer content does not need estimation - only requires making a choice. The approach successfully demonstrates the specific role of counterfactuals in causality through theoretical and numerical examples.

Conclusion: Counterfactual models provide a flexible alternative to structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning, allowing analysts to select appropriate counterfactual conceptions while maintaining consistency with observational and interventional data. This approach advances the formalization of counterfactual beliefs in causal inference.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like
''Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the
most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual
statements cannot be falsified -- even by randomized experiments -- they
underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore,
providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a
fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal
framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to
represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More
precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical
representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a
counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions with
preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of
structural causal models. Then, we present a normalization procedure to
describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions. Compared to
structural causal models, it allows to specify many counterfactual conceptions
without altering the observational and interventional constraints. Moreover,
the content of the model corresponding to the counterfactual layer does not
need to be estimated; only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the
specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach
on theoretical and numerical examples.

### [109] [LLM-Driven Collaborative Model for Untangling Commits via Explicit and Implicit Dependency Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16395)
*Bo Hou,Xin Tan,Kai Zheng,Fang Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ColaUntangle is a collaborative LLM-based framework that uses multiple specialized agents to untangle mixed commits by modeling both explicit and implicit dependencies, achieving 44-100% improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers frequently create tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, which negatively impacts code review and maintenance. Existing commit untangling approaches rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish between explicit dependencies (control/data flow) and implicit ones (semantic/conceptual relationships).

Method: ColaUntangle uses a multi-agent LLM architecture with three specialized agents: one for explicit dependencies, one for implicit dependencies, and a reviewer agent that synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. The framework constructs multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG) to capture contextual information and enable reasoning over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth.

Result: ColaUntangle was evaluated on two datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits) and achieved significant improvements: 44% improvement on the C# dataset and 100% improvement on the Java dataset compared to the best-performing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks, showing that modeling both explicit and implicit dependencies through specialized agents can significantly improve untangling performance.

Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a
best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce
tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or
unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although
prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based,
have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish
between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones
(e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose
ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling
that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.
ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a
multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,
another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives
through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual
information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),
enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and
semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#
and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle
outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on
the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit
untangling tasks.

### [110] [Self-Supervised Inductive Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16405)
*Stassa Patsantzis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Poker, a new Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) system that can learn recursive logic programs in a self-supervised setting without requiring carefully curated negative examples or problem-specific background theories, automatically generating and labeling training examples during learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ILP approaches like MIL require expert-selected background theories and negative examples for effective learning, but these may not always be available. The authors aim to develop a self-supervised ILP approach that can learn from positive labeled examples and unlabeled data without needing manually curated negative examples or domain-specific background knowledge.

Method: The authors develop Poker, a new MIL algorithm implemented in Prolog that: (1) learns from positive labeled and unlabeled examples while automatically generating and labeling new positive and negative examples during training, (2) introduces Second Order Definite Normal Form (SONF) for principled selection of second-order background theory that is general enough to learn all programs in a class, and (3) uses only terminal vocabulary seen in examples as first-order background theory.

Result: Experimental comparison with state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on grammar learning tasks for Context-Free and L-System languages shows that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of automatically generated examples, while Louise over-generalizes when lacking negative examples. Poker successfully learns from minimal background knowledge (just terminal vocabulary) without requiring task-specific theories.

Conclusion: Poker demonstrates that effective ILP learning is possible in self-supervised settings without expert-curated negative examples or problem-specific background theories. The automatic generation of training examples during learning and the use of SONF for general background theory selection enable robust learning that improves with more generated data, addressing key limitations of traditional MIL approaches.

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approaches like Meta \-/ Interpretive
Learning (MIL) can learn, from few examples, recursive logic programs with
invented predicates that generalise well to unseen instances. This ability
relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected
with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such
a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We
formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a
new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled,
and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels,
new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm
in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to
state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for
Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no
negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in
examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for
the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order
Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a
class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning
task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of
automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples,
over-generalises.

### [111] [Identifying Pre-training Data in LLMs: A Neuron Activation-Based Detection Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16414)
*Hongyi Tang,Zhihao Zhu,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NA-PDD, a novel algorithm that detects whether specific data was used in training large language models by analyzing differential neuron activation patterns, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods that rely on superficial features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face legal and ethical concerns due to potential inclusion of copyrighted material and private information in training data, along with issues of dataset contamination and bias internalization. Existing Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) methods have mediocre performance as they rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss.

Method: NA-PDD algorithm analyzes differential neuron activation patterns between training and non-training data in LLMs, based on the observation that these data types activate different neurons during inference. The authors also introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark with rigorous data transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and non-training data.

Result: NA-PDD significantly outperforms existing PDD methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs, demonstrating superior capability in detecting whether specific data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus.

Conclusion: The proposed NA-PDD method successfully addresses the limitations of existing PDD approaches by leveraging neuron activation patterns rather than superficial features, providing a more effective solution for identifying training data inclusion in LLMs and addressing associated legal and ethical concerns.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their
training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information,
raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for
dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the
Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific
data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD
methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss,
resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a
novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between
training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that
these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also
introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data
transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and
non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly
outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

### [112] [From model-based learning to model-free behaviour with Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16434)
*Stassa Patsantzis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines model-based and model-free reinforcement learning by using Meta-Interpretive Learning to train a model-based Solver, which then trains a model-free Controller that achieves equivalent performance on grid navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents need both model-based capabilities (for planning with environmental knowledge) and model-free capabilities (for acting without complete observation) to operate independently in novel environments. Current approaches typically use only one paradigm, limiting their flexibility and adaptability.

Method: The authors use Meta-Interpretive Learning to develop a model-based Solver that learns environmental models and planning strategies. This Solver then trains a model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems without requiring explicit models or complete environmental observation.

Result: The model-free Controller successfully solved all navigation problems that the model-based Solver could solve, demonstrating equivalence in problem-solving ability. This was validated on two types of grid navigation environments: randomly generated mazes and lake maps with open areas.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that it is possible to create autonomous agents that effectively combine model-based and model-free capabilities, achieving the planning benefits of model-based approaches while maintaining the flexibility of model-free methods for acting in partially observable environments.

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the
effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use
its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but
must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can
act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An
autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must
combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with
Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a
model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver.
We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on
grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes,
and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved
by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are
equivalent.

### [113] [Improving ASP-based ORS Schedules through Machine Learning Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16454)
*Pierangela Bruno,Carmine Dodaro,Giuseppe Galatà,Marco Maratea,Marco Mochi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper integrates machine learning with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to solve Operating Room Scheduling problems by predicting surgery durations and generating more robust provisional schedules using historical data from Italian hospitals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASP-based solutions for Operating Room Scheduling can only verify schedules against actual data and suggest alternatives, but cannot generate provisional schedules or ensure robustness. The need to predict surgery durations and create schedules before surgeries occur drives this research.

Method: The authors combine inductive and deductive techniques by: (1) using machine learning algorithms to predict surgery durations from historical data, (2) incorporating prediction confidence as additional input to the ASP encoding, and (3) updating the encoding to compute more robust schedules that account for uncertainty in predictions.

Result: The integrated approach successfully generates provisional schedules and improves robustness compared to previous ASP-only methods. Validation on historical data from ASL1 Liguria in Italy demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of the proposed integration of machine learning with ASP.

Conclusion: The integration of machine learning for duration prediction with ASP for schedule optimization addresses key limitations of existing approaches, enabling the generation of provisional schedules and improving schedule robustness through confidence-aware encoding updates.

Abstract: The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem deals with the optimization of
daily operating room surgery schedules. It is a challenging problem subject to
many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries
and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in
different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer
Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall
satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify
whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest
alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is
not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the
resulting schedules are not always robust.
  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving
these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the
surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then,
we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our
problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust
schedules. Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm
the viability of our integration.

### [114] [Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473)
*Chang Li,Yaren Zhang,Haoran Lv,Qiong Cao,Chao Xue,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for efficient implicit reasoning in LLMs by modeling latent thoughts as hierarchical reinforcement learning options, avoiding the computational cost of explicit Chain-of-Thought generation while maintaining reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting enables strong reasoning in LLMs but is computationally expensive and slow due to explicit step-by-step text generation. The authors aim to develop efficient implicit reasoning where models "think" in latent space without generating text for every reasoning step.

Method: The authors propose modeling latent thoughts as temporally-extended abstract actions (options) in hierarchical reinforcement learning. They introduce Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm using variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. They extend continuous MDP homomorphism theory to prove optimality preservation and propose a cold-start procedure using supervised fine-tuning data to initialize the latent option space.

Result: Extensive experiments show strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning abstract skills in both language and control domains through their proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables efficient implicit reasoning by learning diverse option libraries as latent embeddings, providing a principled method for abstract skill learning that maintains optimality while reducing computational overhead compared to explicit Chain-of-Thought approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step
textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this,
we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the
model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every
step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as
temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of
options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian
Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference
within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these
options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP
homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract
latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the
solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start
procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human
reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich
initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical
reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework
as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and
control.

### [115] [ACT: Bridging the Gap in Code Translation through Synthetic Data Generation & Adaptive Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16478)
*Shreya Saxena,Siva Prasad,Zishan Ahmad,Vishal Vaddina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACT is an automated framework that improves code translation by fine-tuning open-source LLMs using synthetic data generation and dynamic optimization, providing a secure alternative to proprietary solutions while significantly enhancing translation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional code translation methods rely on inflexible handcrafted rules, while advanced language models are often proprietary with security concerns. There's a need for an accessible, secure solution that can match the performance of closed-source alternatives for code translation in software development and migration projects.

Method: ACT framework features: (1) synthetic data generation module that creates high-quality datasets from initial code samples with unit tests, (2) execution-level evaluation framework for comprehensive translation quality assessment, and (3) controller module that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters and orchestrates iterative data generation and fine-tuning based on real-time evaluations.

Result: ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, narrowing the performance gap with closed-source solutions. The framework has been successfully applied to industry-scale migration projects, resulting in notable increases in developer acceleration and providing a secure, reliable alternative for businesses.

Conclusion: ACT successfully addresses the limitations of traditional code translation methods by providing an automated, secure framework that enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance through intelligent synthetic data generation and dynamic optimization, making high-quality code translation accessible without relying on proprietary solutions.

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration
projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and
enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated
translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which
often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models
present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based
implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this
paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative
framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling
in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's
automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,
narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of
closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation
module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code
samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.
ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a
comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its
controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting
hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based
on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to
continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the
process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the
effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a
secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation
pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in
developer acceleration.

Motivation: Conventional RAG systems fail on complex queries in knowledge-intensive domains, providing only limited extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or navigating intricate entity relationships, creating a critical gap in specialized scientific fields.

Method: The system employs an LLM-based agent with multi-tool architecture that dynamically engages a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open access INRAE publications, enabling iterative and targeted queries with multi-hop reasoning capabilities.

Result: INRAExplorer successfully conducts iterative targeted queries, retrieves exhaustive datasets (such as all publications by an author), performs multi-hop reasoning, and delivers structured comprehensive answers for exploring INRAE's scientific data.

Conclusion: INRAExplorer demonstrates how agentic RAG systems can enhance knowledge interaction in specialized fields by overcoming the limitations of conventional RAG through advanced multi-tool architectures and iterative reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering
limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or
navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in
knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system
for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research
Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an
LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich
knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open
access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct
iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment framework for frontier AI models, evaluating seven critical risk areas using red/yellow/green zone classifications, finding that current models remain in manageable zones but require ongoing monitoring and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI models poses unprecedented risks that need systematic identification and assessment to ensure safe development and deployment, requiring a structured framework to understand and manage frontier AI risks.

Method: The paper uses the E-T-C analysis (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework, applying "AI-45° Law" with red lines (intolerable thresholds) and yellow lines (early warning indicators) to create a three-zone risk classification system (green, yellow, red) across seven risk areas.

Result: All recent frontier AI models remain in green and yellow zones without crossing red lines. No models cross yellow lines for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R&D. Most models stay in green zones for self-replication and strategic deception, except some reasoning models in yellow. Most models are in yellow zones for persuasion/manipulation. Biological/chemical risks require further assessment to determine zone placement.

Conclusion: Current frontier AI models operate within manageable risk levels but require continuous monitoring and strengthened mitigations, particularly for persuasion/manipulation capabilities. The framework provides a systematic approach for ongoing risk assessment as AI capabilities advance, calling for collective action to address these evolving challenges.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

### [118] [Novel Multi-Agent Action Masked Deep Reinforcement Learning for General Industrial Assembly Lines Balancing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16635)
*Ali Mohamed Ali,Luca Tirel,Hashim A. Hashim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for optimizing industrial assembly line scheduling by modeling the problem as a Markov Decision Process, using action-masking and multi-agent techniques to improve training efficiency and achieve faster convergence than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for industrial assembly line planning face significant limitations: Integer Programming becomes computationally infeasible for large-scale scenarios due to exponential search space growth, while heuristic methods like Genetic Algorithms often produce suboptimal solutions. There is a need for a more efficient and scalable approach that can handle complex assembly line optimization without restrictive assumptions about assembly line types.

Method: The paper introduces a novel mathematical model formulating industrial assembly lines as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) without type-specific assumptions. The approach employs Deep Reinforcement Learning with two key innovations: (1) an action-masking technique that constrains agents to select only feasible actions, reducing training time, and (2) a multi-agent system where each workstation has its own agent, reducing state and action space complexity. A centralized training with decentralized execution framework is adopted for scalable learning.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed DRL approach achieves significantly faster convergence to optimal solutions compared to comparable model-based approaches. The action-masking technique and multi-agent architecture successfully reduce training time and computational complexity while maintaining solution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning framework with action-masking and multi-agent architecture provides an effective and scalable solution for industrial assembly line optimization. The method offers real-time decision-making capabilities through neural networks that map factory states to optimal actions, representing a significant improvement over traditional Integer Programming and heuristic approaches in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly
lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations,
and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges
can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search
space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for
large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also
be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive
cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial
assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing
assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most
existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment
for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and
resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper
proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which
ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training
time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed
by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced.
A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted,
offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly
lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently
provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network
that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating
significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a
comparable model-based approach.

### [119] [Adaptive Inventory Strategies using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Agri-Food Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16670)
*Amandeep Kaur,Gyan Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm that combines value- and policy-based approaches to optimize inventory management in agri-food supply chains under demand and lead time uncertainties, while considering product perishability and stakeholder coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural products face seasonal production and demand fluctuations, leading to inventory management challenges including excess stock or stockouts. Existing literature lacks consideration of coordination among stakeholders across different levels of the food supply chain, creating research gaps in managing agri-food inventory under uncertainties.

Method: The researchers developed a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that combines both value-based and policy-based DRL approaches for inventory optimization. The algorithm uses continuous action space to select optimal order quantities and incorporates stakeholder collaboration by aligning interests through shared profit maximization goals while simultaneously considering perishability and uncertainty factors.

Result: Experimental validation using empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain demonstrated improved performance of the proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and lead time scenarios. The algorithm effectively maximized overall profit throughout the supply chain while managing uncertainties and product shelf-life constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-based inventory management approach successfully addresses the complex challenges of agri-food supply chain optimization under uncertainty. The research provides valuable managerial implications for policymakers to implement more effective inventory management strategies for agricultural products in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in
production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to
these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or
stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level
of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To
bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of
agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing
effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit
throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases
due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes
challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of
solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL
approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed
algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their
interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing
profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,
and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with
continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the
inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the
empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is
considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the
proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and
lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for
policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively
under uncertainty.

agent performs multi-step reflection and verification over Wikipedia data and
is trained with a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes for accuracy
under a soft reliability constraint. Empirical results show that proposed
method improves alignment between model confidence and correctness, leading to
more trustworthy outputs. This paper will be continuously updated.

### [121] [WGRAMMAR: Leverage Prior Knowledge to Accelerate Structured Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16768)
*Ran Wang,Xiaoxuan Liu,Hao Ren,Gang Chen,Fanchao Qi,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that speeds up structured output generation in LLMs by up to 250x through constraint decomposition, precompiling static structures, and using compositional operators instead of pushdown automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structured decoding methods for LLMs face efficiency bottlenecks in grammar compilation, state tracking, and mask creation when generating outputs in required formats like HTML or JSON for downstream systems.

Method: The approach decomposes constraints into static and dynamic components - precompiling static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using grammar snippets. It uses compositional operators to model regular formats instead of pushdown automata, and integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask caching.

Result: wgrammar achieves up to 250x speedup over existing structured decoding systems while maintaining the ability to generate properly formatted outputs for downstream applications.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that leveraging prior knowledge about output structure and decomposing constraints into static/dynamic components can dramatically improve the efficiency of structured decoding in LLMs without sacrificing output quality.

Abstract: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs
in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However,
existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation,
state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed
strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a
decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling
static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using
grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a
compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower
transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that
integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask
caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source
code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

### [122] [ChatChecker: A Framework for Dialogue System Testing and Evaluation Through Non-cooperative User Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16792)
*Roman Mayr,Michel Schimpf,Thomas Bohné*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatChecker is an automated framework that uses LLMs to comprehensively test and evaluate complex dialogue systems by simulating diverse user interactions and detecting dialogue breakdowns, without requiring reference dialogues or system-specific implementation details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern dialogue systems integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases, making them too complex to evaluate by testing the underlying LLM alone. Previous work focused mainly on turn-level analysis rather than integrated dialogue-level quality assurance, creating a major challenge for comprehensive system evaluation.

Method: ChatChecker employs LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions and evaluate dialogue quality. It includes an error taxonomy in prompts to improve breakdown detection and introduces a novel non-cooperative user simulator based on challenging personas to uncover system weaknesses. The framework is designed to be generalizable and requires minimal setup effort.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved breakdown detection performance compared to prior LLM-based approaches through the inclusion of error taxonomy. The non-cooperative user simulator effectively uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue systems, enabling more thorough testing than previous methods.

Conclusion: ChatChecker provides a scalable solution for automated evaluation and testing of complex dialogue systems that accelerates development of robust dialogue systems for both researchers and practitioners, offering comprehensive dialogue-level quality assurance without system-specific requirements.

Abstract: While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs),
their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers
integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment
of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be
tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With
most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been
paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we
present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of
complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user
interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to
previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as
it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the
implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection
performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in
the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator
based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue
systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and
scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate
the development of robust dialogue systems.

### [123] [Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Transformers for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16796)
*Mian Ibad Ali Shah,Enda Barrett,Karl Mason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel P2P energy trading framework that combines uncertainty-aware prediction using a Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) model and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize trading strategies while accounting for prediction uncertainty, achieving significant cost reductions and revenue increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current P2P energy trading systems rely on deterministic forecasts, which fail to account for prediction uncertainty in the stochastic environment of energy trading. This creates a critical gap in robust decision-making capabilities, necessitating an approach that explicitly quantifies and incorporates uncertainty into trading strategies.

Method: The framework integrates a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) with multi-agent reinforcement learning. The KTU model uses domain-specific features and a custom loss function to provide reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals. These uncertainty-aware forecasts are then integrated into a MARL framework using Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enable agents to optimize trading strategies with risk awareness.

Result: The uncertainty-aware DQN achieved energy purchase cost reductions of up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading. Electricity sales revenue increased by 6.4% and 44.7% respectively. Peak hour grid demand was reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P trading. The improvements were more pronounced when P2P trading was enabled.

Conclusion: The integration of uncertainty-aware forecasting with MARL creates synergistic effects that enhance both economic efficiency and grid resilience in energy communities. The approach demonstrates that explicitly modeling prediction uncertainty leads to more robust trading strategies and better overall system performance, particularly when combined with P2P trading mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading
that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast
to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach
employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model
called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify
prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the
stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages
domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that
ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each
prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL
framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear
understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the
uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to
5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing
electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak
hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These
improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting
the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,
economically efficient energy communities.

### [124] [eSapiens's DEREK Module: Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15863)
*Isaac Shi,Zeyuan Li,Fan Liu,Wenli Wang,Lewei He,Yang Yang,Tianyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEREK is a secure enterprise document QA system that uses hybrid retrieval, reranking, and verification to provide accurate, traceable answers with minimal hallucination, achieving strong performance on legal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise domains like legal and finance require secure, auditable, and context-faithful document question answering systems that can handle heterogeneous content while providing traceable answers and minimizing unsupported statements for high-stakes applications.

Method: The system uses a multi-stage pipeline: (1) ingests diverse document formats and splits into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, (2) indexes using hybrid HNSW+BM25 storage, (3) refines queries with GPT-4o, (4) retrieves via combined vector+BM25 search, (5) reranks with Cohere, (6) generates answers using CO-STAR prompt engineering, and (7) employs LangGraph verifier to enforce citation overlap and regenerate answers until claims are grounded.

Result: On LegalBench subsets: 1000-token chunks improved Recall@50 by ~1pp, hybrid+rerank boosted Precision@10 by ~7pp, the verifier raised TRACe Utilization above 0.50, and limited unsupported statements to less than 3%. The system runs securely with end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256 encryption.

Conclusion: DEREK successfully delivers accurate, traceable, and production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead, meeting enterprise demands for secure and auditable retrieval systems suitable for high-stakes domains like legal and finance.

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge)
Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed
specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and
implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,
web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a
hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via
combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using
CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,
regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,
1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank
boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe
Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All
components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These
results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and
production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is
designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful
retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal
and finance.

### [125] [Adversarial Demonstration Learning for Low-resource NER Using Dual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15864)
*Guowen Yuan,Tien-Hsuan Wu,Lianghao Xia,Ben Kao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper improves named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource scenarios by addressing two key issues: better demonstration example selection using dual similarity (semantic + feature), and enhanced model training with adversarial demonstrations to force the model to reference examples during tagging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demonstration learning methods for low-resource NER have two main problems: (1) demonstration selection relies only on semantic similarity, missing important feature-based similarities, and (2) NER models have inadequate ability to effectively reference demonstration examples during the tagging process.

Method: The authors propose a dual approach: (1) Dual similarity selection that combines both semantic similarity and feature similarity for choosing demonstration examples, and (2) Adversarial demonstration training that forces the NER model to actively refer to demonstrations when performing tagging tasks.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on low-resource NER tasks show that the proposed method outperforms a range of existing methods, demonstrating significant performance improvements in named entity recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: The dual similarity approach for demonstration selection and adversarial training methodology effectively addresses the identified limitations in demonstration-based NER, leading to superior performance in low-resource scenarios compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) based on demonstration
learning in low-resource scenarios. We identify two issues in demonstration
construction and model training. Firstly, existing methods for selecting
demonstration examples primarily rely on semantic similarity; We show that
feature similarity can provide significant performance improvement. Secondly,
we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is
generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that
effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select
examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and
feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with
adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the
demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive
experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our
method outperforms a range of methods.

### [126] [Small Edits, Big Consequences: Telling Good from Bad Robustness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15868)
*Altynbek Ismailov,Salia Asanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study reveals that large language models exhibit problematic robustness patterns when coding - they remain correct even with 90% of prompt words missing but fail to adapt when critical semantic changes (like "max" to "min") occur, suggesting they treat meaningful edits as ignorable noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are used in high-stakes coding environments where misreading a single word can cause safety issues or financial losses, yet they're expected to handle typos. The authors need to understand where useful robustness ends and harmful insensitivity begins in code generation tasks.

Method: The researchers compiled 50 LeetCode problems and applied three types of minimal prompt perturbations: (1) progressive underspecification by deleting 10% of words per step, (2) lexical flips swapping pivotal quantifiers like "max" to "min", and (3) jargon inflation replacing common nouns with obscure technical synonyms. Six frontier models including reasoning-tuned versions were tested, generating 11,853 total outputs that were evaluated against original test suites.

Result: A sharp double asymmetry was observed: models maintained 85% correctness even with 90% of prompt words missing (over-robustness), but only 54% correctly adapted to single quantifier flips that reversed the task meaning. Reasoning-tuned models were even less sensitive than base models. Jargon edits had intermediate success at 56%. Masking salient anchors like function names could force re-evaluation.

Conclusion: Current LLMs blur the distinction between harmless noise and semantically meaningful edits, often treating both as ignorable. The authors advocate for evaluation and training protocols that reward differential sensitivity - maintaining stability under benign noise while adapting or refusing when semantics truly change.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a
single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to
overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful
insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal
prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive
underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping
a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a
common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including
three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python
outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they
reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a
sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 %
of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet
only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with
reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie
in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between
harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable.
Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We
advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential
sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when
semantics truly change.

### [127] [Enhancing Hindi NER in Low Context: A Comparative study of Transformer-based models with vs. without Retrieval Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16002)
*Sumit Singh,Rohit Mishra,Uma Shanker Tiwary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates Hindi Named Entity Recognition (NER) using pretrained encoders (MuRIL, XLM-R) and generative models (Llama-2, Llama-3, GPT-3.5) enhanced with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) from Wikipedia, showing that RA improves NER performance across most models, particularly for resource-limited languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a major challenge in natural language processing, particularly for resource-limited languages like Hindi. The study aims to improve Hindi NER performance by leveraging pretrained models and exploring the potential of data augmentation through retrieval augmentation from external sources.

Method: The researchers employed Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and generative models (Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, Llama-3-70B, and GPT-3.5-turbo) with and without Retrieval Augmentation (RA) using Wikipedia data. They fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R, and Llama2-7B, while using larger models for few-shot NER generation.

Result: Models with Retrieval Augmentation outperformed baseline methods without RA in most cases. MuRIL's macro F1 score improved from 0.69 to 0.70 with RA, while XLM-R improved significantly from 0.495 to 0.71. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B showed substantial improvement over its non-fine-tuned version. GPT-3.5-turbo adapted well to RA, but Llama2-70B and Llama3-70B did not effectively utilize the retrieval context.

Conclusion: Retrieval Augmentation significantly improves NER performance, especially for low-context data and resource-limited languages. The study provides valuable insights into effectively combining data augmentation methods with pretrained models to enhance NER performance in Hindi and similar resource-constrained languages.

Abstract: One major challenge in natural language processing is named entity
recognition (NER), which identifies and categorises named entities in textual
input. In order to improve NER, this study investigates a Hindi NER technique
that makes use of Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and
Generative Models ( Llama-2-7B-chat-hf (Llama2-7B), Llama-2-70B-chat-hf
(Llama2-70B), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Llama3-70B) and GPT3.5-turbo), and augments
the data with retrieved data from external relevant contexts, notably from
Wikipedia. We have fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R and Llama2-7B with and without RA.
However, Llama2-70B, lama3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo are utilised for few-shot NER
generation. Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs)
with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't
incorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69
and 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71,
respectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B
by a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not
fine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA
well; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval
context. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance,
especially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about
how best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER
performance, particularly in languages with limited resources.

### [128] [Learning without training: The implicit dynamics of in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16003)
*Benoit Dherin,Michael Munn,Hanna Mazzawi,Michael Wunder,Javier Gonzalvo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Language Models achieve in-context learning by showing that transformer blocks can implicitly modify MLP weights based on context, providing a theoretical explanation for LLMs' ability to learn new patterns at inference time without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanisms behind in-context learning in LLMs are largely unknown. While LLMs can learn new patterns from examples in prompts at inference time without weight updates, the underlying processes that enable this capability remain mysterious and require investigation.

Method: The authors analyze the interaction between self-attention layers and MLPs in transformer blocks, using both theoretical analysis and experimentation. They examine how the stacking of these components allows implicit weight modification of the MLP layer according to context under mild simplifying assumptions.

Result: The research demonstrates that transformer blocks can implicitly transform context into low-rank weight updates of the MLP layer. This mechanism shows how self-attention and MLP stacking enables the model to effectively modify its weights based on contextual information without explicit parameter updates.

Conclusion: The simple mechanism of stacking self-attention with MLP layers allows transformer blocks to implicitly modify MLP weights according to context, which may explain why LLMs can learn in context during inference rather than only during training. This provides a theoretical foundation for understanding in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLM) is their
ability to learn in context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn
new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are
presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were
not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are
still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a
self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly
modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through
theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why
LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show
under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly
transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

*Hannah Rashkin,Elizabeth Clark,Fantine Huot,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether LLMs can provide meaningful writing feedback to creative writers by creating a controlled test with 1,300 intentionally corrupted stories and evaluating model performance through both automatic and human metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs as writing assistants for creative writers and understand the challenges and limitations of AI-generated writing feedback in a systematic way.

Method: The researchers created a novel test set of 1,300 stories that were intentionally corrupted with writing issues, then evaluated commonly used LLMs' feedback performance using both automatic and human evaluation metrics in a controlled experimental setting.

Result: Current LLMs demonstrate strong out-of-the-box behavior in providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback, but they struggle with identifying the most significant writing issues in stories and fail to appropriately balance critical versus positive feedback.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for providing writing feedback with good specificity and general accuracy, significant limitations remain in their ability to prioritize major writing problems and calibrate the tone of their feedback appropriately.

Abstract: Can LLMs provide support to creative writers by giving meaningful writing
feedback? In this paper, we explore the challenges and limitations of
model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and
evaluation frameworks. To study model performance in a controlled manner, we
present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally
introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in
this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our analysis shows
that current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects --
providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often
fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide
when to offer critical vs. positive feedback.

*Hellina Hailu Nigatu,Min Li,Maartje ter Hoeve,Saloni Potdar,Sarah Chasins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces mRAKL, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that reformulates multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction as a Question Answering task, showing improved performance for low-resource languages like Tigrinya and Amharic through cross-lingual transfer from high-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) is challenging, especially for low-resource languages. Traditional approaches may not effectively leverage cross-lingual information or handle the complexity of predicting missing entities and relationships in multilingual settings.

Method: The authors reformulate mKGC as a Question Answering task using mRAKL (Retrieval-Augmented Generation system). They use head entities and linking relations as questions, with the model predicting tail entities as answers. The approach employs BM25 retriever and experiments with cross-lingual transfer from higher-resourced languages (Arabic and English) to low-resourced languages (Tigrinya and Amharic).

Result: The RAG-based approach shows improved performance over no-context settings. Ablation studies with an idealized retrieval system demonstrate accuracy improvements of 4.92 percentage points for Tigrinya and 8.79 percentage points for Amharic compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: mRAKL successfully improves multilingual knowledge graph construction for low-resource languages by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation and cross-lingual transfer. The QA reformulation proves effective, with significant accuracy gains demonstrated through experimental validation on Tigrinya and Amharic languages.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs represent real-world entities and the relationships between
them. Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) refers to the task of
automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for
knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting. In this work, we reformulate the
mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. We achieve
this by using the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having
our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Our experiments focus primarily
on two low-resourced languages: Tigrinya and Amharic. We experiment with using
higher-resourced languages Arabic and English for cross-lingual transfer. With
a BM25 retriever, we find that the RAG-based approach improves performance over
a no-context setting. Further, our ablation studies show that with an idealized
retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points
for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

### [131] [AutoMeet: a proof-of-concept study of genAI to automate meetings in automotive engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16054)
*Simon Baeuerle,Max Radyschevski,Ulrike Pado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed an AI-powered system that automatically transcribes meetings and creates searchable documentation, testing it in a real engineering department to evaluate both technical performance and ethical considerations for workplace knowledge management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large organizations struggle with inefficient knowledge sharing through meetings that consume significant work time and produce inconsistent documentation (minutes, notes, presentations), making information difficult to retrieve and necessitating frequent update meetings.

Method: Implemented an end-to-end pipeline using generative AI (LLMs) that automatically records meetings, generates minutes, and integrates heterogeneous information sources into a searchable chatbot interface. Tested the system in a real-world engineering department and collected extensive survey data on technical and ethical aspects.

Result: Users agreed that genAI could significantly reduce meeting effort, technical aspects were largely solved, but organizational aspects emerged as crucial for successful ethical implementation. The proof-of-concept demonstrated both opportunities and risks of AI-powered meeting documentation.

Conclusion: While the technical implementation of genAI for automated meeting documentation is feasible and shows promise for reducing meeting overhead, successful deployment requires careful attention to organizational and ethical considerations beyond just technical solutions.

Abstract: In large organisations, knowledge is mainly shared in meetings, which takes
up significant amounts of work time. Additionally, frequent in-person meetings
produce inconsistent documentation -- official minutes, personal notes,
presentations may or may not exist. Shared information therefore becomes hard
to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and
high-frequency meeting schedules.
  Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models like Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit an impressive performance on spoken and written language
processing. This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management
in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and
integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable
format for ad-hoc searches.
  We implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting
documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and
minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through
a chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software
tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey
data on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this
real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that
the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI
models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational
aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTD-DR, a novel framework that treats research report generation as a diffusion process, starting with a preliminary draft and iteratively refining it through denoising with external information retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance on research benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research agents powered by LLMs face performance plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. There's a need for a more effective approach that mimics human research patterns of searching, reasoning, and revision.

Method: TTD-DR conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. It starts with a preliminary draft as an updatable skeleton, then iteratively refines it through a "denoising" process informed by dynamic retrieval of external information. The framework includes a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow to ensure high-quality context generation.

Result: TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks requiring intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents. The draft-centric design improves timeliness and coherence while reducing information loss during iterative search.

Conclusion: The proposed TTD-DR framework successfully addresses the limitations of current research agents by introducing a diffusion-based approach to research report generation, demonstrating superior performance through its draft-centric, iterative refinement process that better mimics human research methodology.

Abstract: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly
advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex,
long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing
inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles
of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep
Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report
generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a
preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation
to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through
a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism
that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is
further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of
the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the
diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process
more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative

results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and
multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.

### [133] [The Prompt Makes the Person(a): A Systematic Evaluation of Sociodemographic Persona Prompting for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16076)
*Marlene Lutz,Indira Sen,Georg Ahnert,Elisa Rogers,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how different persona prompting strategies affect LLMs' ability to simulate various sociodemographic groups, finding that prompt formulation significantly impacts simulation fidelity, with interview-style formats and name-based priming reducing stereotyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persona prompting is increasingly used in LLMs to simulate sociodemographic groups, but concerns exist about simulation fidelity due to how persona prompts are formulated. There's a need to systematically understand how different prompting strategies affect the quality and accuracy of these simulations.

Method: The researchers systematically tested five open-source LLMs using different persona prompt strategies (role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies) across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and closed-ended tasks to evaluate simulation performance.

Result: LLMs struggle most with simulating marginalized groups (nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern identities). Interview-style prompting and name-based priming reduce stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B outperformed larger models such as Llama-3.3-70B in these simulation tasks.

Conclusion: The choice of demographic priming and role adoption strategy significantly impacts LLM portrayal of different groups. The study provides actionable guidance for designing better sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation studies, with specific recommendations for interview-style formats and name-based priming.

Abstract: Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to
simulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona
prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about
the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we
systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically
role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM
simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and
closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate
marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern
identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption
strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that
prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce
stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B
outperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable
guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation
studies.

### [134] [Efficient Compositional Multi-tasking for On-device Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16083)
*Ondrej Bohdal,Mete Ozay,Jijoong Moon,Kyeng-Hun Lee,Hyeonmok Ko,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark and method for compositional multi-tasking in LLMs, where single test examples require simultaneous execution of multiple tasks (like translation + summarization), with focus on resource-efficient on-device applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on task merging in LLMs has been limited to single-task scenarios per test example. There's a need to address compositional multi-tasking where each test example involves simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, particularly in resource-constrained on-device settings.

Method: The authors propose Learnable Calibration, an efficient method tailored for on-device applications that enables compositional multi-tasking through adapter parameter merging. They also create a benchmark with four practically relevant compositional tasks to facilitate research.

Result: The paper establishes a benchmark comprising four compositional tasks and demonstrates an efficient approach for handling simultaneous multi-task execution in resource-constrained environments, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The work lays groundwork for advancing LLM capabilities in real-world multi-tasking scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use cases through efficient compositional task handling.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine
learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large
language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to
support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work
on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been
limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In
this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based
compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous
execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a
long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks
concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark
comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an
efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications,
where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions
that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the
groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking
scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use
cases.

### [135] [BIDWESH: A Bangla Regional Based Hate Speech Detection Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16183)
*Azizul Hakim Fayaz,MD. Shorif Uddin,Rayhan Uddin Bhuiyan,Zakia Sultana,Md. Samiul Islam,Bidyarthi Paul,Tashreef Muhammad,Shahriar Manzoor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIDWESH, the first multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset covering three major regional dialects (Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong) with 9,183 annotated instances to improve hate speech detection in linguistically diverse Bangladesh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hate speech detection systems for Bangla only work with standard language and fail to address informal, culturally rich expressions in regional dialects, resulting in limited detection capability and biased moderation that leaves harmful dialectal content undetected in Bangladesh's linguistically diverse digital platforms.

Method: The researchers created BIDWESH by translating and annotating 9,183 instances from the existing BD-SHS corpus into three major Bangla regional dialects (Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong), with manual verification and multi-dimensional labeling for hate presence, type (slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual, male, female, group).

Result: The study successfully created a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive multi-dialectal hate speech dataset that provides comprehensive coverage of regional Bangla dialects with detailed annotations for hate speech characteristics and target demographics.

Conclusion: BIDWESH establishes the foundation for developing dialect-sensitive NLP tools and significantly contributes to more equitable and context-aware content moderation systems for low-resource language settings, particularly addressing the needs of Bangladesh's diverse linguistic communities.

Abstract: Hate speech on digital platforms has become a growing concern globally,
especially in linguistically diverse countries like Bangladesh, where regional
dialects play a major role in everyday communication. Despite progress in hate
speech detection for standard Bangla, Existing datasets and systems fail to
address the informal and culturally rich expressions found in dialects such as
Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong. This oversight results in limited detection
capability and biased moderation, leaving large sections of harmful content
unaccounted for. To address this gap, this study introduces BIDWESH, the first
multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and
annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional
dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type
(slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual,
male, female, group), ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy. The
resulting dataset provides a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive
resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla. BIDWESH lays the
groundwork for the development of dialect-sensitive NLP tools and contributes
significantly to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource
language settings.

### [136] [Do Large Language Models Have a Planning Theory of Mind? Evidence from MindGames: a Multi-Step Persuasion Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16196)
*Jared Moore,Ned Cooper,Rasmus Overmark,Beba Cibralic,Nick Haber,Cameron R. Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MindGames, a novel "planning theory of mind" (PToM) task that evaluates how well agents can infer others' beliefs and desires to persuade behavioral change. Humans significantly outperformed the o1-preview LLM on this task, suggesting a gap between human social reasoning and current LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Theory of Mind (ToM) experiments only tested LLMs in spectatorial roles where they predict and interpret behavior. However, human ToM also involves dynamic action planning and strategic intervention on others' mental states. The authors wanted to evaluate the practical use cases of ToM rather than just passive observation abilities.

Method: The researchers developed MindGames, a "planning theory of mind" task that requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires in order to persuade them to change their behavior. They compared human performance against the o1-preview LLM on this task, as well as on a baseline condition that required similar planning but minimal mental state inference.

Result: Humans significantly outperformed o1-preview on the PToM task by 11% (p=0.006). However, o1-preview outperformed humans in the baseline condition that required planning when preferences were already given. This suggests humans have an implicit causal model of other agents that helps them know to ask about people's preferences.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between human-like social reasoning and current LLM abilities. While LLMs can perform well at planning tasks when given explicit information, they struggle with the dynamic inference of mental states required for effective social persuasion and intervention.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind
(ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial
role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human
ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically
intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning
theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's
beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous
evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans
significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher;
$p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model
of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's
preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline
condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state
inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already
given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between
human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities.

*Zipeng Ling,Yuehao Tang,Shuliang Liu,Junqi Yang,Shenghong Fu,Yao Wan,Kejia Huang,Zhichao Hou,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze why Large Language Models output "Unknown" responses, distinguishing between genuine indeterminacy and model incapacity, and proposes methods to improve LLM reasoning through guided stimulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs focus only on whether "Unknown" answers are honest, but fail to distinguish between genuinely indeterminate inputs and solvable problems that models fail to resolve. This creates a phenomenon called "Vague Perception" that obscures understanding of LLM reasoning capabilities and improvement potential.

Method: The authors develop a framework that quantifies the proportion of "Unknown" responses due to model incapacity versus genuine indeterminacy. They test guided stimulation techniques to convert "Unknown" responses into either correct ("Known") or intrinsically indeterminate outcomes, and compare different LLMs' theoretical reasoning accuracy against baseline frameworks.

Result: The framework successfully separates sources of uncertainty in LLM responses and provides clearer insights into reasoning limits. The guided stimulation methods show potential for converting model incapacity-based "Unknown" responses into correct answers, revealing the true reasoning capabilities of different LLMs.

Conclusion: The work provides a new perspective on LLM reasoning evaluation by distinguishing between different types of uncertainty. This framework offers better understanding of true LLM reasoning abilities and presents promising approaches for addressing the "Vague Perception" phenomenon through targeted improvement methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label \emph{Unknown}, yet
current evaluations focus almost exclusively on whether such answers are
\emph{honest} rather than why they arise. This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an
input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the
model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon \emph{Vague Perception}. And
thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of \emph{Unknown}
responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation
can convert them into either correct (\emph{Known}) or intrinsically
indeterminate outcomes. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method
provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for
improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different
LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the
accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the
true reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the
\emph{Vague Perception} phenomenon.

*Shahriar Golchin,Yanfei Chen,Rujun Han,Manan Gandhi,Tianli Yu,Swaroop Mishra,Mihai Surdeanu,Rishabh Agarwal,Chen-Yu Lee,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes two efficient demonstration selection strategies for many-shot in-context learning that outperform random selection while maintaining computational efficiency through caching and reducing inference costs by up to 10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current many-shot ICL approaches use random demonstration selection due to high inference costs and caching benefits, but this may not be optimal. The authors aim to improve demonstration selection while maintaining computational efficiency and caching advantages.

Method: Two strategies: (1) Combining a small number of similarity-based demonstrations with a larger set of cached random demonstrations, and (2) Replacing random demonstrations with those selected using k-means clustering centroids derived from test sample representations.

Result: Experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash show both strategies consistently outperform random selection, match or surpass the best performing selection approaches, while supporting caching and reducing inference costs by up to an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed demonstration selection strategies successfully balance performance improvements with computational efficiency in many-shot ICL, offering practical solutions that maintain caching benefits while significantly reducing inference costs.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs
containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning
(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the
input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of
demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)
high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and
(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when
scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for
demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal
computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of
demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a
disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The
second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with
those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via
k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several
datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection
and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting
caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also
show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on
different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks lack systematic and automatic assessment capabilities for deep research AI agents, particularly in the financial domain where problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. There is a critical gap in benchmarks that can comprehensively evaluate financial research agents' performance on long-horizon, complex tasks.

Method: The paper proposes FinResearchBench, a logic tree-based Agent-as-a-Judge evaluation system.

Conclusion: FinResearchBench addresses the evaluation gap for financial research AI agents by introducing an innovative logic tree-based evaluation approach that delivers comprehensive, reliable, and robust assessment capabilities specifically tailored for the financial research domain.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in
professional research applications, such as STEM, software development,
finance, etc. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as
it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity.
However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically
and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents.
Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety.
To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based
Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It
provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across
7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of
this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system

questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the

*Hyunji Nam,Omer Gottesman,Amy Zhang,Dean Foster,Emma Brunskill,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve LLM-based tutors by using latent state representations of students and optimizing long-term policies instead of immediate turn-level responses, achieving better outcomes in math tutoring scenarios with less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF frameworks for LLMs optimize based on immediate turn-level preferences, which is inadequate for multi-turn dialogue settings like online math tutoring where long-term student guidance is crucial for helping them solve problems independently.

Method: The authors represent dialogue history using lower-dimensional latent state representations of students and optimize a long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on these latent states, rather than directly outputting the tutor's next utterance.

Result: The proposed lightweight model requires less computational resources than end-to-end tutor policy training and demonstrates improved long-term outcomes compared to standard prompting approaches in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances LLM-based tutors by focusing on long-term objectives rather than immediate responses, showing that latent state representations and long-term policy optimization can improve tutoring effectiveness while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) built on existing reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF) frameworks typically optimize responses based on
immediate turn-level human preferences. However, this approach falls short in
multi-turn dialogue settings, such as online math tutoring. We propose a method
to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a
lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a
long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The
goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of
guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our
model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of
training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next
utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to
improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring
tasks.

Method: The authors propose an Effective Unlearning Loss - a more controllable forgetting loss function - and explore its integration with various techniques to achieve more efficient and controlled unlearning of sensitive content from LLMs.

Result: The proposed system achieved 5th place on the SemEval 2025 Task 4 competition leaderboard, demonstrating effective performance in both forgetting sensitive information and preserving standard model capabilities across three unlearning datasets.

Conclusion: The Effective Unlearning Loss provides a controllable approach to machine unlearning in LLMs, successfully balancing the trade-off between forgetting sensitive content and maintaining model utility, as validated by competitive performance in the established benchmark.

Abstract: As the Large Language Model (LLM) gains widespread adoption, increasing
attention has been given to the challenge of making LLM forget non-compliant
data memorized during its pre-training. Machine Unlearning focuses on
efficiently erasing sensitive information from LLM under limited computational
resources. To advance research in this area, SemEval 2025 Task 4: "Unlearning

datasets and establishes a benchmark by evaluating both forgetting
effectiveness and the preservation of standard capabilities. In this work, we
propose a more controllable forgetting loss, Effective Unlearning Loss, and
explore its integration with various techniques to achieve more efficient and
controlled unlearning. Our system ultimately ranked 5th on the competition
leaderboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs generate chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable paragraph-style answers when extracting information from complex real-world documents, lacking the ability to present information in an organized, structured format that users can easily follow and verify.

Method: The authors created AOE benchmark with 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains, featuring documents of varying lengths and requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to different input queries, going beyond conventional fixed-schema text-to-table tasks.

Result: Evaluation of both open-source and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs showed that even the most advanced models struggled significantly with the AOE benchmark tasks, indicating poor performance in organized information extraction.

Conclusion: The study reveals a significant gap in current LLMs' capabilities for structured information extraction from complex documents, establishing AOE as a challenging benchmark that highlights the need for improved methods in organized document comprehension and information reconstruction.

Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation
that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world
documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style
answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new
bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to
systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents
and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike
conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task
domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains,
requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input
queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source
state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models
struggled significantly. The benchmark is available at

Motivation: With the rapid evolution of AI-powered language models dominating language identification research, non-AI-based approaches have been overshadowed. The authors aim to explore and validate classical mathematical approaches as effective alternatives to computationally intensive AI-driven models.

Method: A mathematical algorithm implementation that leverages monogram and bigram frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The approach uses frequency-based analysis of character patterns to determine language identity without relying on AI or machine learning techniques.

Result: The method achieves over 80% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches 100% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. Performance was tested across diverse datasets including texts of varying lengths, historical periods, and genres (short stories, fairy tales, and poems).

Conclusion: Classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection. The research demonstrates that non-AI mathematical methods can achieve high accuracy rates and should not be overlooked in favor of more complex AI solutions.

Abstract: The debate surrounding language identification has gained renewed attention
in recent years, especially with the rapid evolution of AI-powered language

frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The datasets
used comprise texts varying in length, historical period, and genre, including
short stories, fairy tales, and poems. Despite these variations, the method
achieves over 80\% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches
100\% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. These results demonstrate
that classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable

*Amit Ben-Artzy,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeLLM decouples input and output vocabularies in LLMs by using multiple character-level prediction heads instead of a single large output projection layer, achieving competitive performance while reducing runtime by 5.1% and enabling better support for underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM architectures face a critical bottleneck when scaling vocabulary size because the output projection layer scales linearly with vocabulary size, making substantial vocabulary expansion impractical despite its benefits for reducing input sequence length and attention's quadratic cost.

Method: SpeLLM uses multiple smaller linear heads (k heads) that each predict a single character simultaneously, rather than a single large output projection layer. The method includes a self-distillation approach to convert standard LLMs to SpeLLM variants by decoupling input and output vocabularies and predicting character-level strings.

Result: Experiments with four pre-trained LLMs showed that SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: SpeLLM provides a viable solution for reducing LLM computational costs while maintaining performance, and offers the additional benefit of increasing support for underrepresented languages and domains through its character-level prediction approach.

Abstract: Scaling LLM vocabulary is often used to reduce input sequence length and
alleviate attention's quadratic cost. Yet, current LLM architectures impose a
critical bottleneck to this procedure: the output projection layer scales
linearly with vocabulary size, rendering substantial expansion impractical. We
propose SpeLLM, a method that decouples input and output vocabularies by
predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. In SpeLLM,
each of the $k$ linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously,
enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller,
independent linear heads. We present a self-distillation approach for
converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM. Our experiments with four pre-trained
LLMs show their SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream
tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. Our approach
provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support
for underrepresented languages and domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to train Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal software verification using Dafny, reducing human supervision through automatic data curation and reinforcement learning with formal verifier feedback, achieving better performance than proprietary models on compositional formal programming tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing informal language-based LLMs trained with RL face unreliable and unscalable verification processes, while providing human priors for complex programming tasks is prohibitively expensive. There's a need for reliable, scalable formal software verification using mathematically provable reasoning processes.

Method: The authors develop a pipeline using Dafny formal language with: (1) automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, (2) careful RL designs integrated with feedback from formal language verifier, (3) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL with regularization, and (4) introduction of DafnyComp benchmark for compositional formal programs.

Result: Small models (0.5B parameters) can generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization achieves stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforms all strong baselines on the DafnyComp benchmark.

Conclusion: Grounding LLMs in formal language systems like Dafny enables automatic, mathematically provable verification while significantly reducing human supervision requirements. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods and proprietary models on formal software verification tasks.

Abstract: Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models
(LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge:
their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are
neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models
could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted
alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous
formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,
Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their
reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving
large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to
employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the
reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes
unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex
programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human
priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot
study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data
curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the
formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional
formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification
reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models
(e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code,
surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves
performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and
outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

### [146] [GG-BBQ: German Gender Bias Benchmark for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16410)
*Shalaka Satheesh,Katrin Klug,Katharina Beckh,Héctor Allende-Cid,Sebastian Houben,Teena Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates gender bias in German Large Language Models by translating and manually correcting an English bias benchmark dataset, finding that all tested models exhibit gender bias both reinforcing and contradicting social stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness evaluation in NLP typically focuses on bias assessment and harm reduction, but existing bias benchmarks are primarily in English. There's a need to evaluate gender bias in German LLMs, which requires adapting existing benchmarks while accounting for the grammatical gender complexities of the German language.

Method: The researchers machine translated the gender identity subset of the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering from English to German, then manually reviewed and corrected translation errors with help from a language expert. They created two subsets: Subset-I with gender identity group terms and Subset-II with proper names replacing group terms. Multiple German LLMs were then evaluated on this adapted dataset.

Result: All evaluated German LLMs exhibited gender bias in their predictions. The bias manifested both in alignment with existing social stereotypes and against them. Manual revision of machine translation proved crucial for creating reliable bias evaluation datasets when translating from English to languages with grammatical gender like German.

Conclusion: Manual correction of machine-translated bias evaluation datasets is essential when adapting from English to grammatically gendered languages like German. All tested German LLMs demonstrate gender bias, highlighting the need for continued bias mitigation efforts in multilingual NLP model development.

Abstract: Within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), fairness evaluation
is often associated with the assessment of bias and reduction of associated
harm. In this regard, the evaluation is usually carried out by using a
benchmark dataset, for a task such as Question Answering, created for the
measurement of bias in the model's predictions along various dimensions,
including gender identity. In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large
Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by
Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender
identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German.
The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and
corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of
the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation
because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language
such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two
subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity,
and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate
several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the
accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both
along and against existing social stereotypes.

### [147] [PromptAL: Sample-Aware Dynamic Soft Prompts for Few-Shot Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16424)
*Hui Xiang,Jinqiao Shi,Ting Zhang,Xiaojie Zhao,Yong Liu,Yong Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptAL is a hybrid active learning framework that uses sample-aware dynamic soft prompts to leverage unlabeled data for better decision boundary optimization in few-shot scenarios, combining uncertainty estimation with global and local diversity for improved sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In few-shot active learning scenarios, the empirical distribution of labeled data often diverges significantly from the target distribution, causing suboptimal decision boundaries. Existing methods overlook the potential of unlabeled samples to enhance the empirical distribution alignment with the target distribution, leading to poor sample selection that inadequately represents the target distribution.

Method: PromptAL uses a two-step approach: (1) constructs sample-aware dynamic soft prompts from unlabeled data to adjust the model's predictive distribution and optimize the decision boundary, and (2) integrates uncertainty estimation with both global and local diversity measures to select high-quality samples that better represent the target distribution based on the adjusted decision boundary.

Result: Experimental evaluation on six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets demonstrates that PromptAL achieves superior performance compared to nine baseline methods, showing improved sample selection and model training efficiency in few-shot active learning scenarios.

Conclusion: PromptAL successfully addresses the distribution mismatch problem in few-shot active learning by leveraging unlabeled data through dynamic soft prompts, resulting in better decision boundaries and more effective sample selection that outperforms existing active learning methods across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL
methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the
decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently
identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the
empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target
distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal
position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in
enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target
distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of
samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this,
we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware
Dynamic Soft \textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning).
This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in
aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,
thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first
leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that
adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,
based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation
with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more
accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six
in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior
performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.

### [148] [Dutch CrowS-Pairs: Adapting a Challenge Dataset for Measuring Social Biases in Language Models for Dutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16442)
*Elza Strazda,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Dutch version of the CrowS-Pairs dataset to measure bias in Dutch language models and compares bias levels across Dutch, English, and French language models, finding that bias varies significantly across languages and contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth and widespread application of language models necessitates ensuring their safety and fairness, as these models are prone to exhibiting biases that amplify harmful stereotypes. While considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language models, most studies focus only on English, creating a need for bias evaluation in other languages like Dutch.

Method: The researchers created a Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset consisting of 1463 sentence pairs covering 9 bias categories (Sexual orientation, Gender, Disability, etc.). Each pair contains contrasting sentences about disadvantaged vs. advantaged groups. They evaluated bias in Dutch models (BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje, Mistral-7B), English models (BERT, RoBERTa), and French models (FlauBERT, CamemBERT). They also tested the effect of assigning personas to language models on bias levels.

Result: All tested language models exhibited substantial bias across various categories. English models showed the highest bias levels, while Dutch models demonstrated the least bias. French models fell between English and Dutch in terms of bias levels. The study also found that assigning personas to language models affects their bias levels, indicating that context manipulation can influence model behavior.

Conclusion: The findings reveal significant variability in bias across different languages and contexts, suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a crucial role in shaping model biases. This highlights the importance of language-specific bias evaluation and the need for tailored approaches to bias mitigation across different linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes
which might be upsetting.
  Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and
harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of
these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of
recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language
models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A
Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in
Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463
sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation,
Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting
sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the
other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that
various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and
Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using
the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated
in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language
models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas
Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that
assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.
These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts,
suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in
shaping model biases.

*Naama Zwerdling,David Boaz,Ella Rabinovich,Guy Uziel,David Amid,Ateret Anaby-Tavor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for ensuring LLM agents follow complex business policies through a two-phase approach: offline compilation of policies into verifiable guard code and runtime enforcement before each agent action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents show potential for business process automation but struggle to reliably follow complex company policies, creating a need for systematic policy enforcement mechanisms in agentic workflows.

Method: A deterministic, transparent, and modular framework with two phases: (1) offline buildtime stage that compiles policy documents into verifiable guard code associated with tool use, and (2) runtime integration where guards ensure compliance before each agent action.

Result: Demonstrated encouraging preliminary results in policy enforcement on the challenging τ-bench Airlines domain, showing the framework's effectiveness in ensuring business policy adherence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a promising solution for enforcing business policy compliance in LLM agents, though key challenges remain for real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents hold promise for a flexible and scalable
alternative to traditional business process automation, but struggle to
reliably follow complex company policies. In this study we introduce a
deterministic, transparent, and modular framework for enforcing business policy
adherence in agentic workflows. Our method operates in two phases: (1) an
offline buildtime stage that compiles policy documents into verifiable guard
code associated with tool use, and (2) a runtime integration where these guards
ensure compliance before each agent action. We demonstrate our approach on the
challenging $\tau$-bench Airlines domain, showing encouraging preliminary
results in policy enforcement, and further outline key challenges for
real-world deployments.

### [150] [ICR Probe: Tracking Hidden State Dynamics for Reliable Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16488)
*Zhenliang Zhang,Xinyu Hu,Huixuan Zhang,Junzhe Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes ICR Score and ICR Probe to detect hallucinations in large language models by analyzing the dynamic evolution of hidden states across layers, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters compared to existing static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods focus on static and isolated hidden state representations, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers, which limits their effectiveness in detecting when LLMs generate unreliable or false information.

Method: The authors introduce ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream) to quantify module contributions to hidden state updates, and develop ICR Probe that captures cross-layer evolution of hidden states for hallucination detection.

Result: ICR Probe achieves superior hallucination detection performance with significantly fewer parameters than existing methods. The ICR Score is empirically validated as effective and reliable for distinguishing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The dynamic analysis of hidden state evolution across layers through ICR Score and ICR Probe provides a more effective approach to hallucination detection in LLMs, offering better performance, parameter efficiency, and improved interpretability through ablation studies and case analyses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their
reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states
predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their
dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this
limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce
a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),
which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We
empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in
distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a
hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer
evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe
achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,
ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying
mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.

### [151] [Combining Language and Topic Models for Hierarchical Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16490)
*Jaco du Toit,Marcel Dunaiski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether combining pre-trained language models (PLMs) with topic models improves hierarchical text classification performance, finding that topic model features generally decrease performance compared to using PLMs alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent approaches combine PLMs with topic models for hierarchical text classification, assuming that PLMs capture fine-grained contextual information while topic models provide high-level corpus-wide representations. However, the actual benefit of this combination for HTC performance needs empirical validation.

Method: The authors developed an HTC approach that extracts features from both PLMs and topic models, processes them through separate convolutional layers, combines the outputs, and uses label-wise attention mechanisms to obtain label-specific document representations for classification.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets showed that incorporating topic model features generally decreased classification performance compared to using only PLM features, contradicting assumptions from previous work.

Conclusion: The combination of PLM and topic model features is not inherently beneficial for hierarchical text classification tasks, challenging the common assumption that topic models always improve text classification performance when combined with pre-trained language models.

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task
which has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes
from a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various
techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the
natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models
along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an
effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale
behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM
captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic
model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents
as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic
model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a
classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of
the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in
general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate
convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise
attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by
weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform
comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using
the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification
performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In
contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features
extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed
beneficial.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EESE (Ever-Evolving Science Exam), a dynamic benchmark with 100K+ science questions across 5 disciplines that addresses data leakage and evaluation inefficiency issues in existing science benchmarks for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing science benchmarks for foundation models face two major challenges: data leakage risks that compromise benchmarking validity, and evaluation inefficiency due to large-scale testing. As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, there's a critical need for reliable assessment of their scientific understanding.

Method: The approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public EESE-Pool with over 100K expertly constructed science question-answer pairs across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring Range, Reach, and Rigor; 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset EESE, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.

Result: Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions, providing robust evaluation capabilities.

Conclusion: EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions while addressing key limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating
their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science
benchmarks have made progress towards broad **Range**, wide **Reach**, and high
**Rigor**, yet they often face two major challenges: **data leakage risks**
that compromise benchmarking validity, and **evaluation inefficiency** due to
large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving
Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess
scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two
components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed
science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+
subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**,
and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled
and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.
Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE
effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific
fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and
forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic
measure of how well foundation models handle science questions. The project

### [153] [Introducing Quality Estimation to Machine Translation Post-editing Workflow: An Empirical Study on Its Usefulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16515)
*Siqi Liu,Guangrong Dai,Dechao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how sentence-level Quality Estimation (QE) affects English-Chinese machine translation post-editing, finding that QE significantly reduces post-editing time and consistently improves efficiency across different MT quality levels and translator expertise, though inaccurate QE can hinder the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the practical usefulness of Quality Estimation in machine translation post-editing workflows, particularly examining how it affects post-editing speed and translator perceptions, and to understand interaction effects between QE and MT quality as well as translator expertise levels.

Method: Preliminary study examining sentence-level Quality Estimation in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing with student translators, analyzing post-editing speed, interaction effects between QE and MT quality/translation expertise, and conducting interviews to gather translator perceptions and experiences.

Result: QE significantly reduces post-editing time and consistently improves MTPE efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs regardless of translator expertise level. No significant interaction effects were found between QE and MT quality or between QE and translation expertise. QE serves multiple functions including validating translator evaluations and enabling double-checking of translations, but inaccurate QE can hinder post-editing processes.

Conclusion: Quality Estimation proves beneficial for machine translation post-editing by reducing time and improving efficiency across different conditions. However, QE accuracy is crucial as inaccurate estimations can negatively impact the post-editing process. The research provides insights for better integration of QE into MTPE workflows to enhance translator productivity.

Abstract: This preliminary study investigates the usefulness of sentence-level Quality
Estimation (QE) in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE),
focusing on its impact on post-editing speed and student translators'
perceptions. It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT
quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal
that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction
effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE
efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student
translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating
potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as
validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to
double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that
inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new
insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more
effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity.

TL;DR: This thesis develops computational methods for text style manipulation through three core areas: style transfer, authorship attribution, and authorship verification, using parameter-efficient LLM adaptation and contrastive learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to computationally understand and manipulate text styles across three critical tasks: changing stylistic properties while preserving content (TST), identifying authors through stylistic patterns (AA), and verifying shared authorship between texts (AV).

Method: Parameter-efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs), contrastive disentanglement of stylistic features, and instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification across the three interconnected pillars of text style analysis.

Result: Development of computational frameworks that can effectively transfer text styles, attribute authorship through stylistic fingerprints, and verify authorship relationships between texts using advanced LLM techniques.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully advances computational text style understanding by integrating three complementary approaches through efficient LLM adaptation, demonstrating the interconnected nature of style transfer, authorship attribution, and verification tasks.

Abstract: This thesis advances the computational understanding and manipulation of text
styles through three interconnected pillars: (1) Text Style Transfer (TST),
which alters stylistic properties (e.g., sentiment, formality) while preserving
content; (2)Authorship Attribution (AA), identifying the author of a text via
stylistic fingerprints; and (3) Authorship Verification (AV), determining
whether two texts share the same authorship. We address critical challenges in
these areas by leveraging parameter-efficient adaptation of large language
models (LLMs), contrastive disentanglement of stylistic features, and
instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification.

TL;DR: This paper presents five German datasets for evaluating gender bias in large language models (LLMs), revealing unique language-specific challenges and emphasizing the need for tailored evaluation frameworks beyond English-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gender bias evaluation methods for LLMs are primarily developed for English and may not transfer effectively to other languages. There is a need to understand how gender bias manifests in non-English languages like German and develop appropriate evaluation frameworks.

Method: The authors developed five German datasets grounded in established gender bias concepts and made them accessible through multiple methodologies. They evaluated eight multilingual LLM models using these datasets to assess gender bias in German.

Result: The evaluation revealed unique challenges in German gender bias, including ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. The findings demonstrate language-specific patterns that differ from English-based evaluations.

Conclusion: Gender bias in LLMs manifests differently across languages, with German presenting unique challenges not captured by English-based evaluation methods. Tailored evaluation frameworks are necessary for each language to properly assess and understand gender bias in multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, various methods have been proposed to evaluate gender bias
in large language models (LLMs). A key challenge lies in the transferability of
bias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when
applied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research
strand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs.
The datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are
accessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight
multilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias
in German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms
and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work
contributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and
underscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.

*Mohamad Ballout,Serwan Jassim,Elia Bruni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates state-of-the-art multimodal large language models on intuitive physics tasks and finds that while vision encoders can capture physical plausibility cues, the language models fail to effectively utilize this information due to vision-language misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with intuitive physics reasoning tasks, and there's a need to understand why these models fail and identify the specific bottlenecks in their performance beyond just measuring accuracy metrics.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate multiple MLLMs (InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) on GRASP and IntPhys 2 datasets, then conduct probing analysis of model embeddings by extracting intermediate representations at key processing stages to examine information preservation.

Result: Even the latest MLLMs struggle to distinguish physically plausible from implausible scenarios. The probing analysis reveals that vision encoders successfully capture physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by the language model, creating a vision-language misalignment that leads to reasoning failures.

Conclusion: The primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not the vision component itself, but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic information. Vision-language alignment emerges as a critical area for improvement in future MLLM development.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) on intuitive physics tasks using the GRASP and
IntPhys 2 datasets. We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that
even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible
from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a
probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations
at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is
preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical
vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture
physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by
the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment
suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not
the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic
information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for
improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) for regulatory compliance verification in financial auditing, comparing open-source models like Llama-2 with proprietary models like GPT-4 using PwC datasets, finding that Llama-2 70B excels at detecting non-compliance while GPT-4 performs better overall, especially in non-English contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven financial auditing systems can recommend relevant text passages from financial reports but fail to verify whether these excerpts actually comply with specific legal mandates and accounting standards, creating a critical gap in automated regulatory compliance verification.

Method: Comparative analysis of publicly available Large Language Models across different configurations for regulatory compliance tasks, specifically comparing open-source models (Llama-2) with proprietary models (GPT series) using two custom datasets provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers Germany.

Result: Open-source Llama-2 70 billion parameter model demonstrated outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance (true negative occurrences), outperforming all proprietary counterparts in this specific task. However, proprietary models like GPT-4 showed superior performance across a broader variety of scenarios, particularly excelling in non-English language contexts.

Conclusion: While open-source models like Llama-2 can match or exceed proprietary models in specific compliance detection tasks, proprietary models like GPT-4 maintain advantages in overall performance and multilingual capabilities, suggesting that model selection for financial auditing should depend on specific use case requirements and language contexts.

Abstract: The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process,
stands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made
inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages
from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting
standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall
short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific
legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly
available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance
across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on
comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their
proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis
leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model
demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true
negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless,
proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of
scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.

### [159] [P-CoT: A Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Phonological Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16656)
*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompting method to improve phonological reasoning in large language models, achieving up to 52% performance improvement on tasks like rhyme generation and syllable counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-based large language models have limited phonological reasoning capabilities despite their strong performance in other language tasks. The researchers aimed to explore and enhance LLMs' ability to perform phonological tasks such as rhyme word generation, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, and syllable counting.

Method: The researchers used the PhonologyBench benchmark to evaluate 12 different LLMs on phonological tasks. They developed a novel Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompting approach based on educational theories like scaffolding and discovery learning, which provides structured guidance to activate latent phonological abilities in LLMs.

Result: The P-CoT prompting method consistently enhanced performance across phonological tasks, achieving up to 52% improvement over baseline approaches. In some tasks, the method even surpassed human performance baselines. Traditional few-shot learning showed inconsistent gains, highlighting the effectiveness of the structured P-CoT approach.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLMs possess latent phonological reasoning capabilities that can be effectively activated through pedagogically-informed prompting strategies. The P-CoT method represents a significant advancement in enhancing phonological reasoning in text-based models, with potential for optimization and application across different linguistic domains.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of phonological reasoning within text-based
large language models (LLMs). Utilizing the PhonologyBench benchmark, we assess
tasks like rhyme word generation, g2p conversion, and syllable counting. Our
evaluations across 12 LLMs reveal that while few-shot learning offers
inconsistent gains, the introduction of a novel Pedagogically-motivated
Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompt, which is anchored in educational
theories like scaffolding and discovery learning, consistently enhances
performance. This method leverages structured guidance to activate latent
phonological abilities, achieving up to 52% improvement and even surpassing
human baselines in certain tasks. Future work could aim to optimize P-CoT
prompts for specific models or explore their application across different
linguistic domains.

### [160] [Self-Contradiction as Self-Improvement: Mitigating the Generation-Understanding Gap in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16663)
*Yujin Han,Hao Chen,Andi Han,Zhiheng Wang,Xinyu Lin,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses self-contradiction in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) where their generation and understanding capabilities are misaligned, proposing methods to leverage this contradiction for self-improvement and introducing a curriculum-based training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs designed to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks exhibit self-contradiction - they generate images that their own understanding component deems misaligned with input prompts. This capability asymmetry between generation and understanding presents both a problem and an opportunity for model improvement.

Method: The authors define a "Nonunified score" to quantify self-contradiction, apply standard post-training methods (SFT, DPO) with internal supervision from the stronger understanding branch to guide weaker generation, and propose a curriculum-based strategy that gradually introduces harder samples during training.

Result: The approach successfully improves both generation and unification through a co-improvement effect when fine-tuning only the generation branch. The study reveals that improvements stem from better detection of false positives and demonstrates that aligned training dynamics between generation and understanding can reduce prompt-misaligned generations while improving mismatch detection.

Conclusion: Self-contradiction in MLLMs can be leveraged for self-improvement through internal supervision. The research establishes theoretical foundations for co-improvement dynamics, identifies risks of co-degradation under poor supervision, and emphasizes the importance of data quality checks. The proposed curriculum-based strategy leads to better unification and improved MLLM performance in both generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a
single model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation
produces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own
understanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such
self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction
mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather
than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of
leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model
understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the
generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,
SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation
and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and
understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known
in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows
improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously
incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned
training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced
prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the
understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of
co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is
empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics
like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,
which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a
curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces
harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and
improved MLLM generation and understanding.

### [161] [PICACO: Pluralistic In-Context Value Alignment of LLMs via Total Correlation Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16679)
*Han Jiang,Dongyao Zhu,Zhihua Wei,Xiaoyuan Yi,Ziang Xiao,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PICACO is a novel pluralistic In-Context Alignment method that addresses value tensions in LLMs by optimizing meta-instructions to better balance multiple conflicting human values without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current In-Context Alignment (ICA) methods face the "Instruction Bottleneck" challenge where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple conflicting human values within a single prompt, as human values are inherently pluralistic and often impose conflicting demands (e.g., stimulation vs. tradition), leading to incomplete or biased alignment.

Method: PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, which theoretically reinforces value correlation while reducing distractive noise to produce effective value instructions without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on five value sets demonstrate that PICACO works effectively with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves better balance across up to 8 distinct values.

Conclusion: PICACO successfully addresses the value tension problem in LLM alignment by providing a pluralistic approach that can handle multiple conflicting values simultaneously, offering a practical solution for aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences without costly post-training.

Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate
diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment
(ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting
ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently
pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.
tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck
challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a
single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we
propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO
optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit
LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by
maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,
theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,
resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value
sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,
outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance
across up to 8 distinct values.

TL;DR: The paper presents a row-stochastic variation of the DEDICOM matrix factorization algorithm applied to pointwise mutual information matrices for simultaneous topic modeling and word embedding learning in text corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a uniquely interpretable matrix factorization method that can simultaneously identify latent topic clusters within vocabulary and learn interpretable word embeddings from text corpora, leveraging DEDICOM's ability to handle both symmetric and asymmetric square matrices.

Method: The method involves applying a new row-stochastic variation of the DEDICOM algorithm to pointwise mutual information matrices of text corpora, along with an efficient training approach for the constrained DEDICOM algorithm.

Result: The paper presents qualitative evaluation results demonstrating the algorithm's performance in both topic modeling and word embedding tasks, showing the dual capability of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The row-stochastic DEDICOM variation successfully provides an interpretable framework for simultaneous topic discovery and word embedding learning, offering a unified approach to these traditionally separate natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: The DEDICOM algorithm provides a uniquely interpretable matrix factorization
method for symmetric and asymmetric square matrices. We employ a new
row-stochastic variation of DEDICOM on the pointwise mutual information
matrices of text corpora to identify latent topic clusters within the
vocabulary and simultaneously learn interpretable word embeddings. We introduce
a method to efficiently train a constrained DEDICOM algorithm and a qualitative
evaluation of its topic modeling and word embedding performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel RAG system using LLMs, hybrid search, and relevance boosting is developed to improve Risk & Quality assurance query processing in regulated industries, showing superior performance over traditional approaches on 124 real-world queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional R&Q assurance in regulated industries relies on specialized experts to handle complex policy interpretation queries, creating operational bottlenecks and limiting scalability. There's a need for automated systems that can accurately process regulatory queries without human expert dependency.

Method: The authors developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with hybrid search techniques and relevance boosting mechanisms. They conducted extensive hyperparameter analysis to optimize system configuration.

Result: The system was evaluated on 124 expert-annotated real-world queries and demonstrated substantial improvements over traditional RAG approaches. The actively deployed system shows enhanced performance in R&Q query processing, with valuable insights gained from hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: The novel RAG system successfully addresses the scalability and bottleneck issues in regulatory query processing by providing automated, accurate policy interpretation. The extensive hyperparameter analysis provides practical guidance for practitioners implementing similar systems in regulated industries.

Abstract: Risk and Quality (R&Q) assurance in highly regulated industries requires
constant navigation of complex regulatory frameworks, with employees handling
numerous daily queries demanding accurate policy interpretation. Traditional
methods relying on specialized experts create operational bottlenecks and limit
scalability. We present a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), hybrid search and relevance boosting
to enhance R&Q query processing. Evaluated on 124 expert-annotated real-world
queries, our actively deployed system demonstrates substantial improvements
over traditional RAG approaches. Additionally, we perform an extensive
hyperparameter analysis to compare and evaluate multiple configuration setups,
delivering valuable insights to practitioners.

### [164] [RAVine: Reality-Aligned Evaluation for Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16725)
*Yilong Xu,Xiang Long,Zhi Zheng,Jinhua Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAVine is a new evaluation framework for agentic search systems that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by using realistic queries, better ground truth construction, and evaluating the iterative search process rather than just final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for agentic search systems have three major problems: (1) complex queries that don't reflect realistic user scenarios, (2) noisy ground truth extraction that distorts fine-grained assessments, and (3) focus only on final answer quality while ignoring the iterative search process that is central to agentic search.

Method: RAVine introduces a reality-aligned evaluation framework that: (1) targets multi-point queries and long-form answers that better reflect user intents, (2) uses an attributable ground truth construction strategy for more accurate fine-grained evaluation, and (3) examines model interactions with search tools throughout the iterative process while accounting for efficiency factors.

Result: The authors benchmarked a series of models using RAVine and derived several insights about agentic search systems, though specific quantitative results are not detailed in the abstract. The framework and datasets are made publicly available.

Conclusion: RAVine provides a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation framework for agentic search systems that better aligns with actual user search scenarios and evaluates both the quality of results and the efficiency of the search process, which should contribute to advancing agentic search system development.

Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval
augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However,
existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic
search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often
deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to
introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,
leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current
frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the
evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address
these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework
for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form
answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground
truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation.
Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the
iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a
series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will
contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

### [165] [Unpacking Ambiguity: The Interaction of Polysemous Discourse Markers and Non-DM Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16748)
*Jingni Wu,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how polysemous discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' interact with non-DM signals in English discourse, finding that polysemous DMs co-occur with more diverse but not necessarily more numerous non-DM signals, with genre significantly influencing these patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discourse markers are crucial for creating coherence but often co-occur with or are replaced by non-DMs, and both can be ambiguous. The interaction mechanism between such signals remains unclear but is pivotal for their disambiguation, necessitating investigation of the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence patterns.

Method: The researchers used the eRST framework to propose a graded definition of DM polysemy and conducted correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals, while also investigating the influence of genre on these patterns.

Result: Polysemous DMs co-occur with more diverse non-DM signals, but the total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

Conclusion: The study reveals that polysemy in discourse markers influences the diversity rather than quantity of accompanying non-DM signals, and that genre is a crucial factor in understanding how discourse markers and other signals interact in creating coherent discourse.

Abstract: Discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' are crucial for creating
coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs
('in the morning' can mean the same as 'then'), and both can be ambiguous
('since' can refer to time or cause). The interaction mechanism between such
signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we
investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM
signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.
  Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy,
and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous
DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings
reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the
total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover,
genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

*Hongyin Luo,Nathaniel Morgan,Tina Li,Derek Zhao,Ai Vy Ngo,Philip Schroeder,Lijie Yang,Assaf Ben-Kish,Jack O'Brien,James Glass*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIM (Thread Inference Model) and TIMRUN runtime that enable LLMs to overcome context limits through recursive reasoning trees and selective memory management, achieving virtually unlimited working memory for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face significant bottlenecks due to context limits that restrict reasoning accuracy and efficiency, along with constraints from positional embeddings, output limits, and GPU memory limitations that prevent effective long-horizon structured reasoning.

Method: The approach models natural language as reasoning trees (with length and depth dimensions) instead of linear sequences, using recursive subtasks with thoughts and conclusions. A rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism maintains working memory by retaining only key-value states of most relevant context tokens, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages.

Result: The system maintains high inference throughput while manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory, delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks, and successfully handles information retrieval challenges requiring long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.

Conclusion: TIM and TIMRUN successfully overcome traditional LLM limitations by enabling virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within single model inference, demonstrating effective performance on complex reasoning tasks that exceed typical context boundaries.

Abstract: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck
reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM),
a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and
TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond
context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited
working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model
inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and
GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as
reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.
The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and
conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During
generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states
of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning
mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages
throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high
inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU
memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles
information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and
multi-hop tool use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free framework that enables LLMs to perform high-fidelity role-playing by automatically decomposing character features into personality, memory, and linguistic style through a three-stage generation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current role-playing language agents face limitations: prompt-based approaches lack deep immersion for specific characters, while fine-tuning approaches are restricted by data collection challenges and computational resource requirements, limiting their broader applicability.

Method: Test-Time-Matching (TTM) uses LLM agents to automatically decouple character features into three components: personality, memory, and linguistic style. The framework employs a structured three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing through test-time scaling and context engineering.

Result: Human assessment evaluation shows that TTM achieves outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues. The framework enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and variations in personality and memory.

Conclusion: TTM successfully addresses the limitations of existing role-playing approaches by providing a training-free solution that achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance while maintaining flexibility in character feature combinations without requiring computational resources for training.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled
role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various
applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often
proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles,
particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand,
fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated
with data collection and the computational resources required for training,
thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we
propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework
through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to
automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and
linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation
pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves
high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations
across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.
We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate
that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive
and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on linguistic tasks focus only on final answer accuracy and lack comprehensive evaluation of complex linguistic reasoning across diverse, low-resource languages. There's a need for culturally informed and cognitively plausible reasoning evaluation inspired by real linguistic challenges.

Method: The authors develop LingBench++, a benchmark with structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and typological metadata across 90+ languages. They create a multi-agent architecture that integrates grammatical knowledge retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing for iterative problem-solving.

Result: The proposed multi-agent models with external knowledge sources and iterative reasoning significantly outperform baseline single-pass approaches in both accuracy and interpretability on complex linguistic tasks across diverse low-resource languages.

Conclusion: LingBench++ provides a comprehensive foundation for advancing linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible reasoning in large language models, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured reasoning and external knowledge integration for complex linguistic tasks.

Abstract: We propose LingBench++, a linguistically-informed benchmark and reasoning
framework designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complex
linguistic tasks inspired by the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL).
Unlike prior benchmarks that focus solely on final answer accuracy, LingBench++
provides structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and rich
typological metadata across over 90 low-resource and cross-cultural languages.
We further develop a multi-agent architecture integrating grammatical knowledge
retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing. Through
systematic comparisons of baseline and our proposed agentic models, we
demonstrate that models equipped with external knowledge sources and iterative
reasoning outperform single-pass approaches in both accuracy and
interpretability. LingBench++ offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing
linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible

TL;DR: This paper introduces TextbookReasoning and MegaScience, large-scale open-source datasets for scientific reasoning, along with comprehensive evaluation systems and trained models that significantly outperform existing approaches in scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-source AI community has focused primarily on mathematics and coding while neglecting scientific reasoning, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets needed for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers.

Method: The authors created TextbookReasoning dataset from 12k university-level textbooks with 650k reasoning questions across 7 scientific disciplines, developed MegaScience through systematic ablation studies to identify optimal data selection methodologies, built a comprehensive evaluation system covering 15 benchmarks, and trained Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series models on the datasets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in scientific reasoning datasets by providing high-quality open-source resources that demonstrate clear performance improvements and scaling benefits. The authors release their complete pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to advance scientific reasoning research in the community.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting
human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery.
However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and
coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of
open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To
bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring
truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific
textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific
disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of
high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed
through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection
methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available
scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system
covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,
incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate
evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve
superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths
compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train
Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which
significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average

*Jun-Wei Zeng,Jerry Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAPS, a multi-modal framework that quantitatively models college admissions by decomposing applicant profiles into three interpretable components (academic performance, essay quality, and extracurricular engagement) using transformer embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression to provide transparent and explainable evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional holistic college admissions review suffers from opacity, inconsistency, and creates anxiety for applicants. There is a need for a more transparent, explainable, and data-informed approach to college admissions that can provide quantitative modeling while maintaining alignment with human judgment.

Method: CAPS framework decomposes applicant profiles into three interpretable components: Standardized Academic Score (SAS), Essay Quality Index (EQI), and Extracurricular Impact Score (EIS). The method combines transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression to create a comprehensive evaluation system.

Result: Strong performance on synthetic but realistic dataset with EQI prediction R² of 0.80, classification accuracy over 75%, macro F1 score of 0.69, and weighted F1 score of 0.74. The framework demonstrates effective quantitative modeling of holistic admissions evaluations.

Conclusion: CAPS successfully addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review by providing transparency and explainability while maintaining performance. The framework paves the way for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices by reducing opacity, inconsistency, and applicant anxiety in the college admissions process.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a
novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret
holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles
into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized
Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and
extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging
transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression,
CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human
judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong
performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy
over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74. CAPS
addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the
opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way
for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices.

*John Wu,Adam Cross,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDMA is a framework that mimics medical experts to identify rare disease patterns in electronic health records by connecting scattered clinical observations, handling medical abbreviations, and applying local contextual reasoning to improve rare disease detection while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ICD coding systems fail to capture rare diseases in electronic health records, leaving crucial information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities.

Method: RDMA (Rare Disease Mining Agents) framework that mirrors how medical experts identify rare disease patterns by connecting scattered clinical observations in EHR. The system handles clinical abbreviations, recognizes implicit disease patterns, and applies contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware.

Result: RDMA improves F1 performance by upwards of 30% and decreases inference costs 10-fold compared to existing approaches. The system reduces privacy risks by processing data locally rather than using cloud services.

Conclusion: RDMA helps clinicians avoid privacy risks of cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems, supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients. The framework successfully addresses the challenges of rare disease identification in clinical settings.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial
information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical
abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with
cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare
Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts
identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical
observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling
clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying
contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks
while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences
costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using
cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems,
supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients. Available at

### [173] [An open dataset of neural networks for hypernetwork research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15869)
*David Kurtenbach,Lior Shamir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a dataset of 10,000 LeNet-5 neural networks for hypernetwork research, where each network is trained for binary classification of ImageNette V2 classes, achieving 72% classification accuracy when distinguishing between different networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of available research resources for hypernetwork research. Despite AI's transformative potential, hypernetworks (neural networks that generate other neural networks by producing model weights) have been understudied, partly due to insufficient datasets for this specific research area.

Method: The authors generated a dataset using a computing cluster of over 10,000 cores. They created 10,000 LeNet-5 neural networks organized into 10 classes, with each class containing 1,000 networks trained for binary image classification to identify a specific ImageNette V2 class from all other classes.

Result: The dataset successfully contains 10,000 LeNet-5 neural networks separated into 10 classes. Basic classification experiments demonstrate that these neural networks can be classified with 72.0% accuracy, indicating that supervised machine learning algorithms can identify meaningful differences between the networks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully creates and validates a dataset specifically designed for hypernetwork research. The 72% classification accuracy proves that the neural networks have distinguishable characteristics, making the dataset suitable for its intended purpose. The dataset and generation code are made publicly available to enable future hypernetwork research.

Abstract: Despite the transformative potential of AI, the concept of neural networks
that can produce other neural networks by generating model weights
(hypernetworks) has been largely understudied. One of the possible reasons is
the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of
hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed
for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5
neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10
classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can
identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing
cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic
classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with
accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks
can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the
code that generates it are open and accessible to the public.

*Jayesh Choudhari,Piyush Kumar Singh,Douglas McIlwraith,Snehal Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) methods for real-world commercial multiclass classification, introducing APE-OPRO, a hybrid framework that combines APE and OPRO to achieve 18% better cost-efficiency than OPRO while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design for Large Language Models remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale. Most existing APO frameworks have only been validated on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity, creating a critical gap for real-world, high-stakes commercial applications.

Method: The authors introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework combining the complementary strengths of APE and OPRO methods. They benchmark this against both gradient-free methods (APE, OPRO) and gradient-based methods (ProTeGi) on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products, conducting ablation studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters.

Result: APE-OPRO achieves approximately 18% improvement in cost-efficiency over OPRO without sacrificing performance. ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute performance at lower API cost but higher computational time. The study reveals notable sensitivity to label formatting and identifies key trade-offs between performance, API efficiency, and scalability across different methods.

Conclusion: APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between performance, API efficiency, and scalability for commercial applications. The findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial settings and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label, vision, and multimodal prompt optimization scenarios.

Abstract: Prompt design is a critical factor in the effectiveness of Large Language
Models (LLMs), yet remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale.
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) methods for real-world, high-stakes multiclass
classification in a commercial setting, addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature where most of the APO frameworks have been validated only
on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity.
  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the
complementary strengths of APE and OPRO, achieving notably better
cost-efficiency, around $18\%$ improvement over OPRO, without sacrificing
performance. We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and
gradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.
  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute
performance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted
in~\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between
performance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation
studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to
label formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior. These
findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial
applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label,

### [175] [ReDi: Rectified Discrete Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15897)
*Jaehoon Yoo,Wonjung Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel method that improves sampling efficiency in Discrete Flow-based Models by reducing factorization error through iterative coupling rectification, enabling few-step generation while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete Flow-based Models suffer from slow sampling speeds due to their reliance on iterative decoding processes, which stems from factorization approximation needed for handling high-dimensional discrete data. This creates a need for more efficient sampling methods.

Method: The authors propose Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), an iterative method that reduces factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target distributions. They use Conditional Total Correlation (TC) to characterize approximation error and design ReDi steps to monotonically decrease this measure.

Result: ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation. The rectified couplings are also well-suited for training efficient one-step models on image generation tasks, demonstrating improved sampling efficiency while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: ReDi provides a simple and theoretically grounded approach for addressing the few-step challenge in discrete data synthesis, offering a new perspective on efficient discrete generative modeling with guaranteed convergence properties.

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for
high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due
to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a
multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,
which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we
rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using
Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce
the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose
Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces
factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target
distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a
monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,
ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for
training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple
and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,
providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is

### [176] [Improving the Generation of VAEs with High Dimensional Latent Spaces by the use of Hyperspherical Coordinates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15900)
*Alejandro Ascarate,Leo Lebrat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Clinton Fookes,Olivier Salvado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of poor random generation in VAEs by proposing hyperspherical coordinates for latent variables, which compresses latent vectors towards a hypersphere island to reduce sparsity and improve generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VAEs fail to generate meaningful data when sampling random latent vectors from the prior, especially in high-dimensional latent spaces (>12 dimensions). This occurs because latent vectors are distributed uniformly on a hypersphere, leading to latent sparsity issues that hurt generation performance.

Method: The authors propose reformulating VAE latent variables using hyperspherical coordinates instead of standard Cartesian coordinates. This parameterization compresses latent vectors towards an "island" on the hypersphere, reducing the sparsity problem while maintaining limited computational overhead.

Result: The hyperspherical parameterization successfully reduces latent sparsity and improves the generation ability of VAEs. The method demonstrates better performance in generating meaningful data from random latent samples compared to standard VAEs.

Conclusion: Hyperspherical coordinate parameterization offers an effective solution to the latent sparsity problem in VAEs, enabling better random generation capabilities with minimal computational cost increase. This approach provides theoretical insight from high-dimensional statistics and practical improvements for VAE architectures.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent
vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, decoding a
random latent vector from the prior usually does not produce meaningful data,
at least when the latent space has more than a dozen dimensions. In this paper,
we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics:
in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction
distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent
variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing
the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the
latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the
VAE. We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited
computational overhead.

### [177] [Towards Mitigation of Hallucination for LLM-empowered Agents: Progressive Generalization Bound Exploration and Watchdog Monitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15903)
*Siyuan Liu,Wenjing Liu,Zhiwei Xu,Xin Wang,Bo Chen,Tao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HalMit is a black-box framework that detects hallucinations in LLM-powered intelligent agents by modeling their generalization bounds through probabilistic fractal sampling, without requiring internal access to the LLM architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered intelligent agents suffer from hallucinations that generate outputs inconsistent with facts, undermining their credibility and creating catastrophic risks in real-world deployment. Existing detection methods either require white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify hallucinations, necessitating a more effective and accessible solution.

Method: The paper proposes HalMit, a black-box watchdog framework that models the generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents. It uses a probabilistic fractal sampling technique to generate sufficient queries that trigger problematic responses in parallel, efficiently identifying the generalization bound of the target agent without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that HalMit significantly outperforms existing approaches in hallucination monitoring. The framework demonstrates superior performance while maintaining its black-box nature, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: HalMit presents a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of LLM-powered systems by providing effective hallucination detection without requiring white-box access. Its superior performance and practical black-box approach make it suitable for ensuring the reliability of intelligent agents in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a
popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI
deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are
inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the
credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the
intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.
Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to
ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches
either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify
hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent
agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the
generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations
without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a
probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient
number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently
identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing
approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior
performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of
LLM-powered systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fast-VAT is a high-performance Python reimplementation of the Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) algorithm that achieves up to 50x speedup while maintaining output fidelity through Numba JIT compilation and Cython optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard VAT algorithm implementation suffers from significant performance limitations due to O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage, making it impractical for larger datasets despite being a widely used unsupervised technique for assessing cluster structure.

Method: The authors developed Fast-VAT by reimplementing the VAT algorithm in Python with two key optimizations: (1) Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for runtime performance improvements, and (2) Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations to reduce memory overhead and computational complexity.

Result: Fast-VAT achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline VAT implementation while preserving the output fidelity of the original method. The approach was validated on real and synthetic datasets (Iris, Mall Customers, Spotify subsets) using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and t-SNE for cluster tendency verification, with results compared against DBSCAN and K-Means clustering.

Conclusion: Fast-VAT successfully addresses the performance bottlenecks of the original VAT algorithm, providing a practical and efficient solution for visual cluster tendency assessment that maintains algorithmic integrity while dramatically improving computational efficiency, making it viable for larger-scale applications.

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised

Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach
achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving
the output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of
real and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify
subsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and
t-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering
results from DBSCAN and K-Means to confirm its reliability.

### [180] [Towards Reliable, Uncertainty-Aware Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15906)
*Debangshu Banerjee,Kintan Saha,Aditya Gopalan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a variance-aware policy optimization framework for LLM alignment that incorporates reward model uncertainty to achieve more stable and robust alignment compared to standard methods that rely on single reward model estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to inaccuracies in reward models, as independently trained reward models on the same preference dataset show substantial disagreement, highlighting instability in alignment strategies and potential overfitting risks.

Method: The authors propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework that includes a new policy regularizer incorporating reward model variance estimates, moving beyond reliance on single reward model estimates to account for uncertainty in reward modeling.

Result: Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model configurations demonstrate that the variance-aware approach yields more stable and robust alignment than standard variance-unaware pipelines, with provable risk reduction for outputting worse policies than the default.

Conclusion: Incorporating reward model variance into policy optimization provides a more reliable approach to LLM alignment, reducing the risk of performance degradation and achieving better stability compared to traditional single reward model-based methods.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) typically involves training a
reward model on preference data, followed by policy optimization with respect
to the reward model. However, optimizing policies with respect to a single
reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward
model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on
open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on
the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting
the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,
we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause
overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this
risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for
preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy
regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that
variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a
worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model
configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust
alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.

### [181] [Dual Turing Test: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating Undetectable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15907)
*Alberto Messina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a "dual Turing test" framework where human judges try to identify AI rather than being fooled by it, combining adversarial classification with quality constraints and RL alignment to create undetectable yet high-quality AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional Turing Test focuses on machines deceiving humans, but there's a need for a framework that ensures AI systems can be both undetectable and maintain quality standards. This addresses the challenge of creating AI alignment methods that balance stealth capabilities with performance quality through formal adversarial guarantees.

Method: The authors formalize a two-player zero-sum game where judges try to detect AI over N rounds with fresh prompts from space Q, incorporating quality function Q with parameters tau and delta. They map this minimax game to an RL-HF alignment loop using an undetectability detector D for negative rewards and quality proxies for preserving fluency, with phased difficulty levels and iterative adversarial training.

Result: The framework successfully bridges three areas: dual Turing testing, formal adversarial classification with quality constraints and worst-case guarantees, and RL alignment pipelines. The method provides minimax bounds and combines quality thresholds with phased difficulty levels in a unified mathematical formulation.

Conclusion: The dual Turing test framework offers a novel approach to AI alignment by inverting the traditional Turing test paradigm and incorporating formal adversarial training with explicit quality constraints. This provides a pathway for developing AI systems that are both undetectable and maintain high performance standards through rigorous mathematical foundations.

Abstract: In this short note, we propose a unified framework that bridges three areas:
(1) a flipped perspective on the Turing Test, the "dual Turing test", in which
a human judge's goal is to identify an AI rather than reward a machine for
deception; (2) a formal adversarial classification game with explicit quality
constraints and worst-case guarantees; and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL)
alignment pipeline that uses an undetectability detector and a set of quality
related components in its reward model. We review historical precedents, from
inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing
classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased
difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define
the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a
prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,
and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's
feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style
alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward
for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.
Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the
meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative
adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate
actions.

### [182] [HyDRA: A Hybrid-Driven Reasoning Architecture for Verifiable Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15917)
*Adrian Kaiser,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei,Ryan Gold,Marius-Constantin Dinu,Markus Hofmarcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDRA is a hybrid neurosymbolic architecture that automates reliable Knowledge Graph construction by first building ontologies through collaborative agents and competency questions, then using design-by-contract principles to guide LLM-based triplet extraction with verifiable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated Knowledge Graph construction faces critical challenges including output reliability, consistency, and verifiability issues such as structural inconsistencies, isolated data islands, and incorrect conflation of abstract classes with specific instances, creating a bottleneck for advancing neurosymbolic AI.

Method: HyDRA employs collaborative neurosymbolic agents to construct ontologies by agreeing on competency questions that define scope and requirements. The resulting ontology graph guides automated triplet extraction from documents, using design-by-contract principles and verifiable contracts to control LLM generative processes.

Result: The approach produces more reliable and structurally consistent Knowledge Graphs with verifiable outputs. An evaluation framework using symbolic verifications from the SymbolicAI framework demonstrates improved functional correctness compared to standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: HyDRA successfully addresses key reliability challenges in automated KG construction through its hybrid-driven architecture, contributing both a novel construction method and improved evaluation approaches for measuring functional integrity of generated Knowledge Graphs.

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to
advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to
output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest
as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the
formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate
conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these
challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven
$\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG
automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first
constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These
agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define
the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these
CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated
extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by
design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts
as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large
Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond
standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the
functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications
as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This
work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of
automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for
measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly
available.

### [183] [On the transferability of Sparse Autoencoders for interpreting compressed models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15977)
*Suchit Gupte,Vishnu Kabir Chhabra,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how model compression affects interpretability in LLMs by studying Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), finding that SAEs trained on original models can interpret compressed models with minimal performance loss, and that pruning the original SAE directly is as effective as retraining on compressed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale, leading to various compression methods like pruning and quantization. However, the impact of compression on model interpretability remains unclear, particularly for interpretation methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that decompose activation spaces into feature bases.

Method: The authors compare SAEs trained on original models versus compressed models, examining how well SAEs from original models can interpret compressed versions. They also investigate pruning the original SAE directly as an alternative to retraining SAEs on compressed models.

Result: SAEs trained on original models can successfully interpret compressed models with only slight performance degradation compared to SAEs specifically trained on compressed models. Additionally, simply pruning the original SAE achieves comparable performance to training a new SAE on the pruned model.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that expensive retraining of SAEs for compressed models may not be necessary, as existing SAEs can transfer effectively to compressed versions. This enables significant reduction in SAE training costs while maintaining interpretability capabilities for compressed LLMs.

Abstract: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To
address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and
quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability
remains elusive. While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as
circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly
effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In
this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed
models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the
compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the
trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original
SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned
model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of

*Kyung-hwan Lee,Kyung-tae Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAL-GP, a semantic-aware layer-wise Gaussian Process framework that mirrors neural network architecture to improve confidence calibration by applying local GP corrections at each layer while maintaining global coherence through structured multi-layer kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Gaussian Process calibration methods fail to capture the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, which limits both interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability in neural network classifiers.

Method: The paper introduces Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that employs a multi-layer GP model where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration correction. These layer-wise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers.

Result: The SAL-GP framework captures both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the network, enhancing interpretability aligned with the network architecture.

Conclusion: SAL-GP enables principled evaluation of confidence consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models by better capturing the hierarchical structure of neural networks compared to conventional single global GP correction methods.

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

*Mohammad Taha Askari,Lutz Lampe,Amirhossein Ghazisaeidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an autoregressive end-to-end learning method for probabilistic shaping in nonlinear fiber optic channels, achieving 0.3-bits/2D information rate improvement over optimized marginal distributions for 64-QAM transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional probabilistic shaping methods for fiber optic communications typically optimize marginal symbol distributions independently, but this approach may not capture the complex joint dependencies in nonlinear fiber channels, limiting performance gains.

Method: The authors develop an autoregressive end-to-end learning approach that learns the joint symbol distribution rather than just marginal distributions, enabling better adaptation to the nonlinear characteristics of fiber optic channels.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 0.3-bits/2D achievable information rate gain compared to optimized marginal distribution approaches when tested on dual-polarized 64-QAM transmission over a single-span 205 km fiber link.

### [187] [Reactivation: Empirical NTK Dynamics Under Task Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16039)
*Yuzhi Liu,Zixuan Chen,Zirui Zhang,Yufei Liu,Giulia Lanzillotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) dynamics in continual learning settings where data distributions change over time, challenging the validity of static-kernel approximations used in theoretical continual learning analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous NTK research has been limited to single-task settings with constant data distributions. The authors aim to understand how NTK dynamics behave in continual learning scenarios where data distributions shift over time, as this is crucial for understanding feature learning in more realistic settings.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning settings, examining how the kernel evolves when the data distribution changes over time rather than remaining static.

Result: The findings reveal that continual learning serves as a rich testbed for studying neural training dynamics. The results challenge the validity of static-kernel approximations commonly used in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large scale.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that continual learning provides valuable insights into neural network dynamics and questions the appropriateness of static NTK assumptions in continual learning theory, suggesting that kernel evolution is essential even in large-scale settings.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the
functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel
regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is
linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK
during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep
learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical
discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However,
this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data
distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where
the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual
learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural
training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel
approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large
scale.

### [188] [A Lower Bound for the Number of Linear Regions of Ternary ReLU Regression Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16079)
*Yuta Nakahara,Manabu Kobayashi,Toshiyasu Matsushima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of ternary neural networks (using parameters {-1, 0, +1}) by studying their expressivity through linear regions, proving they achieve polynomial growth with width and exponential growth with depth similar to standard networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite excellent practical performance of ternary neural networks in applications like image recognition and NLP, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. The authors aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the expressivity of ternary NNs to explain their practical success.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze ternary neural networks from the perspective of linear regions. They evaluate the number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with ReLU activation functions and compare their expressivity bounds with standard neural networks.

Result: The paper proves that ternary NNs achieve polynomial growth in linear regions with respect to network width and exponential growth with respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. They show that squaring the width or doubling the depth of ternary NNs can achieve comparable lower bounds on maximum linear regions as general ReLU regression NNs.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis provides mathematical justification for the practical success of ternary neural networks by demonstrating their comparable expressivity to standard networks when appropriate architectural adjustments (width/depth scaling) are made.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning, reducing computational complexity and
memory consumption has become a critical challenge, and ternary neural networks
(NNs) that restrict parameters to $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ have attracted attention as a
promising approach. While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in
practical applications such as image recognition and natural language
processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the
perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the
number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions
increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with
respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices
to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a
lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of
general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some
sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease shows substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response, but current predictive models are limited in their ability to accurately forecast individualized disease trajectories. There's a need for personalized modeling approaches that can capture patient-specific disease dynamics.

Method: The authors developed a machine learning-based operator learning framework that integrates longitudinal multimodal imaging, biomarker, and clinical data.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable, interpretable platform for precision modeling and personalized therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases, offering significant improvements over conventional models with prespecified dynamics through its patient-specific operator learning approach.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative
disorder with substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response.
Despite recent therapeutic advances, predictive models capable of accurately
forecasting individualized disease trajectories remain limited. Here, we
present a machine learning-based operator learning framework for personalized
modeling of AD progression, integrating longitudinal multimodal imaging,
biomarker, and clinical data. Unlike conventional models with prespecified
dynamics, our approach directly learns patient-specific disease operators
governing the spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration
biomarkers. Using Laplacian eigenfunction bases, we construct geometry-aware
neural operators capable of capturing complex brain dynamics. Embedded within a
digital twin paradigm, the framework enables individualized predictions,
simulation of therapeutic interventions, and in silico clinical trials. Applied
to AD clinical data, our method achieves high prediction accuracy exceeding 90%
across multiple biomarkers, substantially outperforming existing approaches.

*Yang Yu,Kai Han,Hang Zhou,Yehui Tang,Kaiqi Huang,Yunhe Wang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Data Weighting Model (DWM) that dynamically adjusts data weights during LLM training using bi-level optimization, improving training efficiency and model performance while providing insights into evolving data preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for LLM training use static, training-agnostic criteria that don't account for dynamic interactions between model training and data. There's a need for adaptive data utilization that responds to the model's changing preferences during training to enhance efficiency and reduce computational costs.

Method: The authors develop a Data Weighting Model (DWM) that dynamically adjusts weights of selected data within each training batch. They implement a bi-level optimization framework to update the weighting model, allowing it to capture the evolving data preferences of the trained model throughout the training process.

Result: DWM improves performance of models trained with randomly-selected data. The learned weighting model demonstrates transferability, successfully enhancing other data selection methods and models of different sizes. The method provides valuable insights into how model data preferences evolve during training.

Conclusion: The proposed DWM successfully addresses limitations of static data selection by introducing dynamic data weighting during LLM training. The bi-level optimization approach effectively captures evolving model preferences, leading to improved training efficiency and transferable performance gains across different models and data selection methods.

Abstract: While large-scale training data is fundamental for developing capable large
language models (LLMs), strategically selecting high-quality data has emerged
as a critical approach to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational
costs. Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,
training-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training
and data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model
(DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a
dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the
dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework
is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and
the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection
methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a
model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights
into the data preference of the model during training.

*Kaiyuan Li,Pengyu Wang,Yunshan Peng,Pengjia Yuan,Yanxiang Zeng,Rui Xiang,Yanhua Cheng,Xialong Liu,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes EBaReT, a novel transformer-based reinforcement learning approach for automated bidding that addresses data quality issues and reward uncertainty by using expert-guided training and bag-based reward smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL approaches for automated bidding suffer from low data quality due to sub-optimal bids and sparse rewards from low click/conversion rates. Existing generative RL methods rely on supervised learning which is vulnerable to these data quality issues, yet few studies address these fundamental challenges.

Method: The paper formalizes automated bidding as sequence decision-making and introduces Expert-guided Bag Reward Transformer (EBaReT). Key components include: (1) generating expert trajectories as supplementary training data, (2) using Positive-Unlabeled learning-based discriminator to identify expert transitions, (3) expert-guided inference strategy, and (4) bag-based reward function that groups transitions within time periods for smoother reward acquisition.

Result: Extensive experiments show that EBaReT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding methods, demonstrating effectiveness in handling data quality issues and reward uncertainty in automated bidding scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed EBaReT successfully addresses key challenges in automated bidding by incorporating expert guidance and bag-based reward smoothing, leading to improved performance over existing methods and providing a robust solution for real-world bidding applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a "bag" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.

TL;DR: RealBench is the first benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks, featuring complex designs, multi-modal specifications, and rigorous verification environments. Even the best LLMs achieve low performance (13.3% pass@1 for module-level, 0% for system-level), revealing significant room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation are inadequate for real-world scenarios due to their simplicity, poor design specifications, and insufficient verification environments, failing to replicate actual hardware design workflows.

Method: The authors developed RealBench with complex, structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design specifications, and rigorous verification environments including 100% line coverage testbenches and formal checkers. The benchmark supports both module-level and system-level tasks.

Result: Evaluation results show that even top-performing LLMs like o1-preview achieve only 13.3% pass@1 on module-level tasks and 0% on system-level tasks, demonstrating the significant challenge posed by real-world Verilog generation tasks.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and real-world hardware design requirements, highlighting the urgent need for developing stronger Verilog generation models for practical hardware design automation applications.

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs)
has garnered significant interest in hardware design automation. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation fall short in
replicating real-world design workflows due to their designs' simplicity,
inadequate design specifications, and less rigorous verification environments.
To address these limitations, we present RealBench, the first benchmark aiming
at real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks. RealBench features complex,
structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design
specifications, and rigorous verification environments, including 100% line
coverage testbenches and a formal checker. It supports both module-level and
system-level tasks, enabling comprehensive assessments of LLM capabilities.
Evaluations on various LLMs and agents reveal that even one of the
best-performing LLMs, o1-preview, achieves only a 13.3% pass@1 on module-level

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: METER is a unified multi-modal benchmark for interpretable forgery detection across images, videos, audio, and audio-visual content, featuring evidence-chain-based explanations and a human-aligned Chain-of-Thought training strategy to advance generalizable deepfake detection in the generative AI era.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detection methods focus only on binary classification without interpretable explanations, treat modalities separately without unified benchmarks, and lack detailed forensic analysis capabilities needed for safety-critical scenarios where understanding why content is fake is crucial.

Method: The authors introduce METER, a multi-modal benchmark with four tracks requiring real-vs-fake classification plus evidence-chain explanations (spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, forgery type tracing), and propose a three-stage Chain-of-Thought training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a novel Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) stage with human-aligned evaluation.

Result: METER provides broader modality coverage than prior benchmarks and offers richer interpretability metrics including spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class tracing, and evidence consistency, establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework for cross-modal forgery detection with detailed explanations.

Conclusion: METER serves as a standardized foundation for advancing generalizable and interpretable forgery detection, addressing the critical need for explainable AI systems in combating misinformation from increasingly sophisticated generative media technologies.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images,
videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of
misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary
classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of
forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.
Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a
unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To
address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark
for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and
audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not
only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations,
including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type
tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage
and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class
tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned,
three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a
novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.
We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing
generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative
media.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMPTCR, a novel molecular surface representation that combines quantum-derived scalar fields and topological descriptors in an aligned point cloud format to better capture surface-local phenomena for molecular property prediction, achieving strong performance on molecular weight prediction (R² = 0.87) and bacterial growth inhibition tasks (ROC AUC = 0.912).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular property prediction models rely on representations like SMILES strings and molecular graphs that overlook surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based approaches either reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive SE(3)-equivariant architectures to handle spatial variance.

Method: The authors developed AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and Topology Cloud Representation), which combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes chemically meaningful scalars, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates transformed into a canonical reference frame. The method was evaluated using a DGCNN framework.

Result: For molecular weight prediction, AMPTCR achieved a validation R² of 0.87, confirming it encodes physically meaningful data. For bacterial growth inhibition, the method achieved ROC AUC of 0.912 for classification and R² of 0.54 for regression of E. coli inhibition values using Dual Fukui functions and Morgan Fingerprints.

Conclusion: AMPTCR provides a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties, successfully capturing surface-local phenomena that traditional representations miss while being compatible with conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures.

Abstract: Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on
representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook
the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based
approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive
SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these
limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and
Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that
combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors
within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically
meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates
transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with
conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN
framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For
molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful
data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR
enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values
using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints
as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,
and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that
AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation
for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reinforcement learning approaches for mapping deep neural networks to hardware suffer from sample inefficiency due to the vast and complex mapping space, limiting their effectiveness in optimizing accelerator design.

Method: A decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework with an agent clustering algorithm that assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation analysis, enabling parallelized learning while avoiding training inefficiencies.

Result: The MARL approach achieves 30-300x improvement in sample efficiency compared to standard single-agent RL, with up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized MARL framework with agent clustering successfully addresses the sample inefficiency problem in DNN-to-hardware mapping, significantly accelerating the optimization process for high-performance accelerator design.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing
latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone
of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping
space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its
effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a
decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to
overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our
framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training
multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that
assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation
analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that
significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL
approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL,
achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP)
reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STWeaver is a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces memory fragmentation by 79.2% on average through offline planning and online allocation, enabling more efficient training of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models scaling creates severe GPU memory pressure, worsened by training optimizations like virtual pipeline and recomputation that cause memory fragmentation. Default allocators in frameworks like PyTorch waste up to 43% of memory due to lack of tensor lifespan knowledge, making optimization techniques ineffective.

Method: STWeaver combines offline planning with online allocation to exploit spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation patterns. The offline component generates near-optimal allocation plans using spatio-temporal regularities, while the online component handles dynamic models like Mixture-of-Experts. It's implemented as a pluggable PyTorch allocator.

Result: STWeaver reduces memory fragmentation ratio by 79.2% on average (up to 100%) across dense and sparse models with negligible overhead. This improvement enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and achieves performance improvements up to 32.5%.

Conclusion: STWeaver successfully addresses GPU memory fragmentation in large language model training through its novel offline-online allocation paradigm, significantly improving memory efficiency and training performance while maintaining compatibility with existing frameworks.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased
GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible
overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations
and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.

### [198] [Understanding Generalization, Robustness, and Interpretability in Low-Capacity Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16278)
*Yash Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between model capacity, sparsity, and robustness in low-capacity neural networks using binary classification tasks from MNIST with varying visual difficulty, finding that sparse subnetworks can maintain performance while over-parameterization improves corruption robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in low-capacity networks, which remains understudied despite the prevalence of massive over-parameterized models in modern deep learning.

Method: Created a controlled framework using binary classification tasks from MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty (e.g., 0 vs 1, 4 vs 9), then systematically studied model capacity requirements, pruning robustness, and corruption resistance. Used interpretability analysis via saliency maps to examine sparse subnetworks.

Result: Three key findings: (1) minimum model capacity scales directly with task complexity, (2) trained networks are robust to extreme pruning up to 95% sparsity while maintaining high performance, and (3) over-parameterization significantly improves robustness against input corruption. Sparse subnetworks preserve core reasoning of dense models.

Conclusion: The study provides clear empirical evidence of foundational trade-offs in simple neural networks, demonstrating that sparse high-performing subnetworks exist within trained models and that over-parameterization offers robustness benefits beyond just improved training dynamics.

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

*Boheng Li,Renjie Gu,Junjie Wang,Leyi Qi,Yiming Li,Run Wang,Zhan Qin,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework for text-to-image diffusion models that maintains safety effectiveness even after downstream fine-tuning, addressing the fragility of existing safety methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, and existing safety-driven unlearning methods fail to retain effectiveness when models are fine-tuned on downstream tasks, even with benign datasets.

Method: ResAlign uses a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation to model downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem for efficient gradient estimation, combined with a meta-learning strategy to simulate diverse fine-tuning scenarios and improve generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability across various datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations.

Conclusion: ResAlign successfully addresses the fragility problem of safety-driven unlearning methods by maintaining safety effectiveness against downstream fine-tuning while preserving model performance on benign tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

*Xin-De Wang,Zhi-Rui Chen,Peng-Jie Guo,Ze-Feng Gao,Cheng Mu,Zhong-Yi Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers developed Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model trained on 1,232 scientific publications and 33,269 materials to accelerate discovery and design of perovskite solar cell precursor additives, demonstrating effective AI-driven materials discovery through experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perovskite solar cells show great promise but face commercialization challenges including long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing. The explosive growth of scientific literature and complex material interactions make it difficult for researchers to efficiently access and utilize domain knowledge for precursor additive engineering solutions.

Method: The authors created Perovskite-R1 by fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on a domain-specific dataset constructed from 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and 33,269 candidate materials. They used automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning to build the instruction-tuning dataset, enabling the model to synthesize literature insights and generate solutions for defect passivation and precursor additive selection.

Result: Perovskite-R1 successfully generated innovative and practical solutions for defect passivation and precursor additive selection. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirmed their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance in perovskite solar cells.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that domain-adapted large language models can effectively accelerate materials discovery in perovskite photovoltaics. The research provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements and shows the potential for AI to bridge the gap between vast scientific literature and practical materials engineering solutions.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

### [201] [The Cost of Compression: Tight Quadratic Black-Box Attacks on Sketches for $\ell_2$ Norm Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16345)
*Sara Ahmadian,Edith Cohen,Uri Stemmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a universal black-box adversarial attack against linear sketching methods for dimensionality reduction that can cause norm estimation failures or construct adversarial inputs using only O(k²) queries, regardless of the specific sketching matrix or estimator used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear sketching for dimensionality reduction is widely used but known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. The authors aim to understand the fundamental limitations and vulnerabilities of these compressed representations in black-box adversarial settings where attackers can only query the system without knowing the internal sketching matrix.

Method: The authors develop a universal, non-adaptive attack algorithm that works in a black-box setting. The attack queries a hidden sketching system that maps high-dimensional vectors to lower-dimensional sketches and obtains approximate ℓ2-norm estimates. The method is agnostic to both the sketching matrix and the estimator, working against any linear sketch and query responder.

Result: The attack successfully causes norm estimation failures or constructs adversarial inputs using only Õ(k²) queries, where k is the sketch dimension. This attack complexity tightly matches known upper bounds of Õ(Ω(k²)) achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. The attack works against randomized, adaptive, or distribution-tailored estimators.

Conclusion: The paper establishes fundamental vulnerabilities in linear sketching methods, showing that any such system can be attacked with optimal query complexity. The results reveal structural parallels between adversarial attacks on sketching systems and image classification, highlighting that compressed representations are inherently vulnerable to adversarial manipulation regardless of their specific implementation.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used
technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the
black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in
$R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional
sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain
approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch.
  We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$)
queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an
adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution
(used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching
matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query
responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the
query distribution.
  Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of
tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson
Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results
uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification,
highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.

### [202] [Leveraging Personalized PageRank and Higher-Order Topological Structures for Heterophily Mitigation in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16347)
*Yumeng Wang,Zengyi Wo,Wenjun Wang,Xingcheng Fu,Minglai Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HPGNN integrates Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks to improve node classification on heterophilic graphs by capturing multi-scale interactions and reducing noise, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 5 out of 7 benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs assume homophily (connected nodes have similar labels) but fail on heterophilic graphs where this doesn't hold. Current models for heterophilic graphs only use pairwise relationships, missing multi-scale information from higher-order structures, leading to suboptimal performance especially under noise from conflicting class information.

Method: HPGNN proposes an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) integrated with Graph Neural Networks to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. The method embeds higher-order structural information into convolutional networks while reducing computational complexity and mitigating noise from surrounding information.

Result: HPGNN achieves better performance than 5 out of 7 state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness in balancing multi-scale information and robustness to noise.

Conclusion: HPGNN provides a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges by effectively modeling key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. The integration of higher-order PPR with GNNs successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches on heterophilic graphs while preserving performance on homophilic graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often
assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption
does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for
heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking
multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal
performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across
nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating
Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces
an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture
long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces
computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By
embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks,
HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness.
The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art
methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining
competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance
multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution
for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at

### [203] [Bipartite Patient-Modality Graph Learning with Event-Conditional Modelling of Censoring for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16363)
*Hailin Yue,Hulin Kuang,Jin Liu,Junjian Li,Lanlan Wang,Mengshen He,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CenSurv proposes a bipartite patient-modality graph learning approach with event-conditional modeling of censoring to improve cancer survival prediction by better utilizing censored samples and handling modality-missing scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cancer survival prediction studies focus only on samples with known survival risks without fully leveraging censored samples, suffer from performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios, and struggle during inference processes.

Method: The method uses bipartite graph structure to model multimodal data, implements complete-incomplete alignment strategy for modality-agnostic features, and designs a plug-and-play event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) module that selects reliable censored data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences and assigns more accurate survival times.

Result: CenSurv outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.1% in mean C-index across 5 cancer datasets, shows excellent robustness under modality-missing scenarios, and the ECMC module improves 8 baseline methods by 1.3% mean C-index increase.

Conclusion: The proposed CenSurv framework effectively addresses limitations in cancer survival prediction by better utilizing censored data and handling missing modalities, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for
personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the
relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully
leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer
performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during
the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality
graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer
survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to
model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance
degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to
simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing
scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore
modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play
event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored
data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate
survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data
into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase
the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of
the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various
modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,
the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of
CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.

*Zhihan Zeng,Yiqi Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes SGD training of two-layer physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for least-squares regression without requiring over-parameterization, showing that networks can achieve O(ε) training and expected loss with width depending only on ε and the problem, not the number of training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous theoretical analysis of PINNs relied on over-parameterization regime where network width must increase vastly with training samples, leading to prohibitive computational costs and impractical theory far from real experiments. There was a need for more practical theoretical understanding that avoids over-parameterization.

Method: The authors perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in training two-layer PINNs by making specific assumptions about the target function to avoid the over-parameterization requirement. They analyze the convergence behavior under these more practical conditions.

Result: The paper proves that if the network width exceeds a threshold that depends only on ε (error tolerance) and the problem characteristics (but not on the number of training samples), then both training loss and expected loss will decrease below O(ε).

Conclusion: The work provides a more practical theoretical framework for understanding PINN training that avoids the computational prohibitive requirements of over-parameterization, showing that effective training can be achieved with network widths that scale independently of the training sample size.

Abstract: This work focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
Past work on this topic has been based on the over-parameterization regime,
whose convergence may require the network width to increase vastly with the
number of training samples. So, the theory derived from over-parameterization
may incur prohibitive computational costs and is far from practical
experiments. We perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in
training two-layer PINNs, making certain assumptions about the target function
to avoid over-parameterization. Given $\epsilon>0$, we show that if the network
width exceeds a threshold that depends only on $\epsilon$ and the problem, then
the training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\epsilon)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks AI-generated synthetic data for addressing class imbalance in tabular datasets, showing that synthetic upsampling outperforms traditional methods like SMOTE-NC for improving minority class prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unbalanced tabular datasets pose significant challenges in real-world applications like fraud detection and medical diagnosis, where minority classes are vastly underrepresented. Traditional machine learning algorithms favor majority classes, leading to biased models that poorly represent minority classes.

Method: The study evaluates the MOSTLY AI Synthetic Data SDK for generating synthetic data to upsample minority classes in highly unbalanced tabular datasets. They compare predictive models trained on synthetically upsampled data against standard methods including naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC.

Result: Synthetic data upsampling consistently produces top-performing predictive models, particularly for mixed-type datasets with very few minority samples. The approach improves predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse data points that fill gaps in sparse feature space regions.

Conclusion: AI-generated synthetic data provides an effective solution for addressing class imbalance in tabular datasets, outperforming traditional upsampling methods and offering a flexible, user-friendly approach for improving minority class representation in predictive modeling.

Abstract: Unbalanced tabular data sets present significant challenges for predictive
modeling and data analysis across a wide range of applications. In many
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare
event prediction, minority classes are vastly underrepresented, making it
difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models
that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds
promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by
providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a
benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly
unbalanced tabular data sets.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data
SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to
synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained
on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods,
such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse
data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space. We show that
upsampled synthetic training data consistently results in top-performing
predictive models, particularly for mixed-type data sets containing very few
minority samples.

*Tomás Hüttebräucker,Mario Edoardo Pandolfo,Simone Fiorellino,Emilio Calvanese Strinati,Paolo Di Lorenzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to address semantic mismatches in MIMO semantic communication systems, where independently trained AI devices have divergent latent representations that impede mutual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In semantic communication systems, multi-user settings with independently trained agents (without shared context or joint optimization) lead to divergent latent representations across AI-native devices, causing semantic mismatches that impede mutual understanding even without traditional transmission errors.

Method: The authors propose a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework leveraging RIS in MIMO channels. The semantic equalization involves three stages: (i) pre-equalization at transmitter, (ii) propagation through RIS-aided channel, and (iii) post-equalization at receiver. They formulate this as a constrained MMSE optimization problem and propose two solutions: linear semantic equalization chain and non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer, both operating under semantic compression and transmit power constraints.

Result: Through extensive evaluations, both proposed joint equalization strategies (linear and non-linear) consistently outperform conventional disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Conclusion: The joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework using RIS effectively addresses semantic mismatches in multi-user semantic communication systems, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional separate equalization approaches across various wireless channel conditions.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

*Isabella Degen,Zahraa S Abdallah,Kate Robson Brown,Henry W J Reeve*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces canonical correlation patterns as validation targets for clustering multivariate time series, addressing the challenge that existing clustering validity indices designed for Euclidean data are inadequate for correlation-based clustering validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering with discrete geometric reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns, making validation of correlation-based clustering a fundamental challenge.

Method: The authors introduce canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretize the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. They use synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions to evaluate different norms (L1 for mapping, L5 for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index).

Result: Canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. The methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation.

Conclusion: This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains by providing practical implementation guidelines for validating correlation-based clustering using canonical correlation patterns.

Abstract: Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods
reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health,
finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered
clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were
developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns
has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where
geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in
continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this
validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically
defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into
finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect
ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical
patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5
norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior
performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately
detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation
guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous
correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

### [208] [Analogy making as amortised model construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16511)
*David G. Nagy,Tingke Shen,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu,Peter Dayan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework where agents use analogies as partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes to flexibly construct internal models for navigation in novel situations, enabling reuse of solution-relevant structure from past experiences through modular building blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans need to construct internal models that are both faithful enough to the environment for effective planning and tractable to build. The challenge is balancing model accuracy with computational feasibility when facing novel situations that require flexible adaptation.

Method: The authors formalize analogies as partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes and develop a framework using abstract modules derived from previous construals as composable building blocks. This enables modular reuse of structure across domains with shared essence.

Result: The framework allows agents to amortize computational costs of both model construction (construal) and planning by reusing solution-relevant structure from past experiences. It enables flexible adaptation of policies and representations across different domains.

Conclusion: Analogy plays a central role in enabling agents to construct useful internal models by providing a mechanism for structural reuse that balances computational tractability with environmental fidelity, supporting flexible navigation across novel situations.

Abstract: Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be
useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment
that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must
be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a
central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant
structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both
model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial
homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which
abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable
building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation
of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

*Abhash Kumar Jha,Shakiba Moradian,Arjun Krishnakumar,Martin Rapp,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library for gradient-based one-shot NAS that addresses benchmark saturation and implementation fragmentation issues, revealing critical flaws in current evaluation methods through new DARTS-based benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of gradient-based one-shot NAS faces two major challenges: (1) overreliance on DARTS benchmark leading to saturation with improvements often within noise margins, and (2) fragmented implementations across different repositories making fair comparisons and reproducible research difficult.

Method: The authors develop Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library with a minimal API that enables easy integration of new search spaces and supports decomposition of NAS optimizers into core components. They create new DARTS-based benchmarks and implement a novel evaluation protocol.

Result: The framework successfully streamlines development and evaluation of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. The new benchmarks and evaluation protocol reveal critical flaws in how current gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are assessed, providing more reliable evaluation capabilities.

Conclusion: Confopt addresses key infrastructure challenges in gradient-based NAS research by providing a unified framework for fair comparisons and revealing evaluation issues that were previously hidden by benchmark limitations and implementation differences.

Abstract: Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design
choices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces
two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily
rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available
benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements
often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate
repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further
development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an
extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes
it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the
decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this
framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them
with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how

### [210] [Symbolic Graph Intelligence: Hypervector Message Passing for Learning Graph-Level Patterns with Tsetlin Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16537)
*Christian D. Blakely*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a symbolic framework for graph classification using sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines, which encodes graphs through structured message passing while maintaining interpretability and achieving competitive performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural graph models lack interpretability and symbolic transparency. There is a need for graph classification methods that can provide both competitive accuracy and clear explanations of their decision-making process, particularly through symbolic representations that preserve hierarchical graph semantics.

Method: A multilayered symbolic framework that uses sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Graphs are encoded through structured message passing where node, edge, and attribute information are bound and bundled into symbolic hypervectors. The approach uses layered binding from node attributes to edge relations to structural roles, creating compact discrete representations. A local interpretability framework is also formulated.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive accuracy on TUDataset benchmarks while providing strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph models. The approach successfully maintains interpretability without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: The proposed symbolic framework successfully combines competitive graph classification performance with interpretability through sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. The hierarchical encoding preserves graph semantics while enabling local interpretability, offering a transparent alternative to black-box neural approaches.

Abstract: We propose a multilayered symbolic framework for general graph classification
that leverages sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Each graph is
encoded through structured message passing, where node, edge, and attribute
information are bound and bundled into a symbolic hypervector. This process
preserves the hierarchical semantics of the graph through layered binding from
node attributes to edge relations to structural roles resulting in a compact,
discrete representation. We also formulate a local interpretability framework
which lends itself to a key advantage of our approach being locally
interpretable. We validate our method on TUDataset benchmarks, demonstrating
competitive accuracy with strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph
models.

*Zhengyu Wu,Xunkai Li,Yinlin Zhu,Zekai Chen,Guochen Yan,Yanyu Yan,Hao Zhang,Yuming Ai,Xinmo Jin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey proposes a novel data-centric taxonomy for Federated Graph Learning (FGL) that categorizes research based on data characteristics and utilization, rather than just methodology, to better understand how FGL handles data-centric challenges in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL surveys focus primarily on methodology and simulated scenarios, lacking a systematic data-centric perspective that examines how FGL methods handle data properties and usage constraints. This gap limits understanding of how FGL studies tackle data-centric challenges to enhance model performance in real applications.

Method: The authors develop a two-level data-centric taxonomy: (1) Data Characteristics - categorizing studies based on structural and distributional properties of datasets, and (2) Data Utilization - analyzing training procedures and techniques to overcome data-centric challenges. Each level uses three orthogonal criteria representing distinct data-centric configurations.

Result: The survey successfully reorganizes FGL research through the proposed data-centric lens, examines FGL integration with pretrained large models, showcases realistic applications, and provides comprehensive analysis of how different FGL approaches handle various data characteristics and utilization scenarios.

Conclusion: The data-centric taxonomy provides a more systematic and practical framework for understanding FGL research compared to existing methodology-focused surveys. This perspective better aligns with real-world constraints and highlights future directions that incorporate emerging trends in graph machine learning and large model integration.

Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has
emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing
the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and
preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have
contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning
(FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that
emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric
perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data
properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is
critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to
enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric
taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the
structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data
Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to
overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three
orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration.
Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large
Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction
aligned with emerging trends in GML.

*Rahul Khorana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops new machine learning methods for CW complexes by deriving Wasserstein distance expressions using Hodge-Laplacian matrices and introducing novel kernels for probability measures on cell complexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of available machine learning methods suitable for learning on CW complexes, despite recent advances discussing cell complexes as ideal learning representations.

Method: The authors derive an explicit expression for Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal distributions using Hodge-Laplacian matrices, extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW complexes, and introduce novel kernels based on dual formulation of optimal transport.

Result: The paper provides a structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes, defines optimal transportation maps, and creates methods that simultaneously include both feature and structure information.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap in machine learning methods for CW complexes by providing mathematical frameworks that incorporate both structural and feature information through optimal transport theory.

Abstract: Recent advances have discussed cell complexes as ideal learning
representations. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods
suitable for learning on CW complexes. In this paper, we derive an explicit
expression for the Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal
distributions in terms of a Hodge-Laplacian matrix. This leads to a
structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes and define the optimal
transportation map. In order to simultaneously include both feature and
structure information, we extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW
complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability
measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.

### [213] [Scaling Linear Attention with Sparse State Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16577)
*Yuqi Pan,Yongqi An,Zheng Li,Yuhong Chou,Ruijie Zhu,Xiaohui Wang,Mingxuan Wang,Jinqiao Wang,Guoqi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sparse State Expansion (SSE), a novel linear attention mechanism that addresses Transformer's quadratic complexity in long contexts by using sparse state updates and multi-partition contextual states, achieving superior performance in retrieval and mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Transformers suffer from quadratic computation and linear memory growth in long-context scenarios. Existing linear attention variants that compress context into fixed-size states often degrade performance in tasks like in-context retrieval and reasoning, creating a need for more effective context compression methods.

Method: The paper introduces two key innovations: (1) A row-sparse update formulation for linear attention that treats state updating as information classification, enabling sparse state updates via softmax-based top-k hard classification; (2) Sparse State Expansion (SSE) that expands contextual state into multiple partitions, decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining sparse classification.

Result: SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and favorable scaling with state size. A 2B SSE-H model after reinforcement learning training achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers.

Conclusion: SSE represents a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling that successfully addresses the efficiency constraints of traditional Transformers while maintaining or improving performance on challenging tasks like retrieval and mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

### [214] [Meta-Learning for Cold-Start Personalization in Prompt-Tuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16672)
*Yushang Zhao,Huijie Shen,Dannier Li,Lu Chang,Chengrui Zhou,Yinuo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a meta-learning framework for LLM-based recommender systems that uses parameter-efficient prompt-tuning to quickly personalize recommendations for cold-start users, achieving real-time performance (275ms adaptation) with applications in both recommendation systems and financial risk profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based recommender systems struggle with cold-start users who have little to no interaction history. Existing solutions like supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are dense-user-item focused, expensive to maintain and update, and poorly adapted to situations where users have minimal historical data.

Method: The authors develop a meta-learning framework that performs parameter-efficient prompt-tuning using soft prompt embeddings. The method employs first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization, treating each user as a separate task. Learnable prompt vectors serve as differentiable control variables representing user behavioral priors, optimized through episodic sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization.

Result: The adaptive model outperforms strong baselines on MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole datasets across metrics including NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR. The system achieves real-time performance with adaptation times below 300ms on consumer GPUs, specifically 275ms for adaptation. It supports zero-history personalization and demonstrates scalability for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses cold-start personalization in LLM-based recommender systems while maintaining real-time performance. The 275ms adaptation capability enables practical applications beyond recommendations, including real-time risk profiling for financial institutions, which can reduce detection latency and strengthen payment network stability against systemic vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Generative, explainable, and flexible recommender systems, derived using
Large Language Models (LLM) are promising and poorly adapted to the cold-start
user situation, where there is little to no history of interaction. The current
solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are
dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This
paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based
recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt
embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by
treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,
these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent
user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic
sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On
MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model
outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in
real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization
is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation
allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening
detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275
ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial
institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly
versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment
networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial
infrastructure resilience.

### [215] [GASPnet: Global Agreement to Synchronize Phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16674)
*Andrea Alamiaa,Sabine Muzellec,Thomas Serre,Rufin VanRullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a brain-inspired neural network architecture that combines Transformer attention mechanisms with neuroscience's "binding by synchrony" theory, using angular phases and Kuramoto dynamics to improve feature binding and achieve better accuracy, noise robustness, and generalization compared to standard CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural networks struggle with the visual binding problem - efficiently binding features from the same object while separating those from different objects. Previous work on "routing by agreement" showed promise but was insufficient for multi-classification tasks. The motivation is to address this limitation by incorporating neuroscience insights about how the brain binds features through temporal synchronization.

Method: The authors incorporate angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network and use Kuramoto dynamics to achieve phase alignment. This creates a mechanism that enhances operations between neurons with similar phases while suppressing those with opposite phases, effectively implementing the "binding by synchrony" theory from neuroscience combined with Transformer-like attention operations.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates better accuracy than CNN networks on two datasets: pairs of digits and MNIST items superimposed on CIFAR-10 images. The approach shows improved robustness to noise and better generalization abilities compared to baseline CNN architectures.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by creating a novel mechanism that synergistically combines insights from neuroscience (binding by synchrony) and machine learning (Transformer attention). This brain-inspired approach proves more effective than standard CNNs for multi-object scenarios requiring feature binding and separation.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of
artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the
agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the
network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture
that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by
agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by
matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire
network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise
robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification
tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that
combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling
neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that
the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of
neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the
same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We
drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all
layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto
dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with
similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits
of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one
composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.
Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to
noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel
mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by
leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

*Vasileios Titopoulos,Kosmas Alexandridis,Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flash-ABFT is a novel error detection method for attention mechanism accelerators that computes online checksums across the entire three-matrix product (query, key, value) including softmax operations, achieving high fault detection with only 5.3% area overhead and <1.9% energy overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques can only verify individual matrix multiplications but cannot handle the complete attention mechanism, especially the intermediate softmax normalization. There's a need for efficient error detection in specialized hardware accelerators for Transformers and LLMs that can handle the full attention computation pipeline.

Method: Flash-ABFT computes an online checksum across the entire three-matrix product of query, key, and value matrices in an attention layer, including the softmax operation, using a single unified check instead of separate verifications for each matrix multiplication.

Result: Flash-ABFT achieves high fault-detection accuracy while incurring only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9% energy overhead. The method significantly reduces computational overhead by eliminating redundant checks compared to traditional ABFT approaches.

Conclusion: Flash-ABFT provides a cost-effective and robust solution for error detection in attention accelerators by enabling comprehensive fault tolerance for the complete attention mechanism with minimal hardware and energy overheads, making it practical for deployment in specialized AI hardware.

Abstract: Transformers and large language models (LLMs), powered by the attention
mechanism, have transformed numerous AI applications, driving the need for
specialized hardware accelerators. A major challenge in these accelerators is
efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional
algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix
multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism,
particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes
Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire
three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer,
including the softmax operation, with a single check. This approach
significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while
maintaining high fault-detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that Flash-ABFT incurs only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9%
energy overhead, making it a cost-effective and robust solution for error
detection in attention accelerators.

*Mario Edoardo Pandolfo,Simone Fiorellino,Emilio Calvanese Strinati,Paolo Di Lorenzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a MIMO-based approach to solve semantic misalignment issues in semantic communications by learning precoder/decoder pairs that jointly perform latent space compression and semantic channel equalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic communications may suffer from semantic mismatches when devices use different languages, logic, or internal representations, which can hinder mutual understanding and task completion in information exchange.

Method: The paper develops two solutions: (1) a linear model optimized through biconvex optimization using ADMM, and (2) a neural network-based model that learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder pairs under power budget and complexity constraints to address latent space misalignment.

Result: Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed MIMO approach in goal-oriented semantic communication scenarios, demonstrating clear trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and solution complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed MIMO-based semantic communication method successfully mitigates both semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments by jointly performing latent space compression and semantic channel equalization, offering practical solutions for semantic communication systems.

Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the
meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks
that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on
different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches
may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a
novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic
communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair
that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel
equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel
impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving
a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic
MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity
constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the
main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the
solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FISHER is a foundation model that addresses the M5 problem in industrial signal analysis by providing unified multi-modal representation learning for SCADA systems, achieving 5.03% performance improvement over existing SSL models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial signal analysis faces the M5 problem - significant heterogeneity across different signal modalities. Previous approaches only tackle small sub-problems with specialized models, failing to leverage synergies between modalities and scaling laws, despite the intrinsic similarity of these signals.

Method: FISHER uses STFT sub-bands as modeling units to handle arbitrary sampling rates by treating sampling rate increments as concatenation of sub-band information. The model employs a teacher-student self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for pre-training on multi-modal industrial signals.

Result: FISHER demonstrates versatile capabilities with up to 5.03% general performance gain compared to top SSL models, along with more efficient scaling curves. The authors also developed the RMIS benchmark for evaluating M5 industrial signal representations across multiple health management tasks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that unified modeling of heterogeneous industrial signals is feasible and beneficial, with FISHER providing a foundation model approach that outperforms specialized models while offering better scalability for industrial signal analysis applications.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze
industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the
industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we
summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems
and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between
modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals
can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a
result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal
compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER
considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band
information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit
and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop
the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial
signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,
FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general
performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We
also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential
avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on

*Viktor Muryn,Marta Sumyk,Mariya Hirna,Sofiya Garkot,Maksym Shamrai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Screen2AX is a framework that automatically generates hierarchical accessibility metadata from desktop screenshots to help AI agents and assistive technologies better interpret and interact with desktop interfaces, achieving 77% F1 score and 2.2x performance improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many desktop applications lack proper accessibility metadata (only 33% of macOS apps offer full support), making them difficult for AI agents and assistive technologies like screen readers to interpret. Existing screen representation methods address specific challenges but fail to capture the full hierarchical complexity of desktop interfaces.

Method: Screen2AX uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and hierarchically organize UI elements from a single screenshot, replicating macOS's system-level accessibility structure. The authors compiled three datasets with 112 macOS applications annotated for UI detection, grouping, and hierarchical metadata.

Result: Screen2AX achieves 77% F1 score in reconstructing complete accessibility trees and delivers 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations. It outperforms state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 on the ScreenSpot benchmark. The generated hierarchy trees significantly improve autonomous agents' ability to interpret complex desktop interfaces.

Conclusion: Screen2AX successfully addresses the accessibility gap in desktop applications by automatically generating real-time, hierarchical accessibility metadata from screenshots. This framework enhances both assistive technology support and autonomous agent performance in desktop environments, with the release of comprehensive datasets enabling future research in this domain.

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic framework for tuning coreset generation to improve classification performance by introducing new parameters beyond traditional sensitivity scores, demonstrating superior results compared to vanilla coresets and full dataset training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional sensitivity-based coreset construction focuses on loss approximation rather than optimizing for classification performance metrics like F1 score, leading to suboptimal downstream classification quality in data-centric AI applications.

Method: The authors develop a systematic framework that introduces tunable parameters including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation, and refinement via active sampling, going beyond traditional sensitivity scores to optimize coreset generation for classification tasks.

Result: Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, tuned coresets significantly outperformed both vanilla coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, demonstrating improved efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed tuning framework for coreset generation provides an effective path towards better and more efficient model training by optimizing for classification performance rather than just loss approximation, offering superior results in data-centric AI applications.

Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the ability to curate high-quality training
data is as crucial as model design. Coresets offer a principled approach to
data reduction, enabling efficient learning on large datasets through
importance sampling. However, conventional sensitivity-based coreset
construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance
metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation. In this
work, we present a systematic framework for tuning the coreset generation
process to enhance downstream classification quality. Our method introduces new
tunable parameters--including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation,
and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.
Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, we
demonstrate that tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla
coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an
effective path towards better and more efficient model training.

### [221] [A Partitioned Sparse Variational Gaussian Process for Fast, Distributed Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16771)
*Michael Grosskopf,Kellin Rumsey,Ayan Biswas,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP), a scalable machine learning approach for exascale supercomputers that enables in-situ training on spatially distributed data by allowing limited communication between neighboring spatial partitions to create smoother, more accurate predictions while maintaining high scalability and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation exascale supercomputers will generate far more computational data than can be stored to disk, making post-hoc statistical analysis impossible. This creates an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can perform in-situ training on spatially distributed data across multiple nodes while being highly scalable and memory efficient.

Method: The authors extend the independent Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) approach by introducing Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP), which allows limited communication between neighboring spatial partitions. This decentralized communication scheme encourages better alignment of local models at shared boundaries while maintaining scalability and adding minimal computational overhead with no additional memory requirements.

Result: The PSVGP approach successfully addresses the discontinuous response surface problem that occurs with independent SVGP models at partition boundaries. The method produces smoother spatial predictions and better overall fit compared to the independent SVGP case, as demonstrated through testing on the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM).

Conclusion: The proposed PSVGP method successfully enables scalable, memory-efficient machine learning for exascale computing environments by incorporating minimal inter-partition communication to improve model consistency and prediction quality while maintaining the computational advantages needed for in-situ analysis of massive distributed datasets.

Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of
exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible
than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely
on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical
analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning
algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting
must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is
distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable
approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model
independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is
scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect
of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between
neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea
by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial
partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to
smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our
decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly
scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in
terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the
independent SVGP case.

*Helena Casademunt,Caden Juang,Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAFT is a new technique that uses interpretability tools to control how large language models generalize during fine-tuning by ablating undesired concepts in the model's latent space, without requiring modifications to training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models often leads to unintended out-of-distribution generalization, and standard approaches requiring training data modification are not always practical. There's a need for methods to control LLM generalization without modifying training data or using target distribution data.

Method: Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT) identifies directions in an LLM's latent space that correspond to undesired concepts, then uses linear projections to ablate these concepts during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations.

Result: CAFT successfully addresses three fine-tuning tasks including emergent misalignment. It reduces misaligned responses by 10x while maintaining performance on the training distribution, all without changing the fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization that doesn't require modifying training data, offering a practical solution for controlling unintended out-of-distribution behavior in fine-tuned language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended
out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on
modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the
intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce
Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages
interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without
needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target
distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding
to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear
projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended
generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,
including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow
task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.
Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses
by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,
CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without
modifying training data.

### [223] [Beyond Binary Rewards: Training LMs to Reason About Their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16806)
*Mehul Damani,Isha Puri,Stewart Slocum,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Yoon Kim,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), a method that trains language models to generate both accurate predictions and well-calibrated confidence estimates for reasoning tasks by augmenting binary correctness rewards with Brier scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL training for reasoning uses binary rewards that don't penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, leading to degraded calibration and increased hallucination rates. There's a need for training methods that jointly improve both accuracy and confidence calibration in reasoning models.

Method: RLCR trains language models to generate predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning, optimizing a reward function that combines binary correctness scores with Brier scores (a proper scoring rule for confidence estimates). The method uses bounded, proper scoring rules to incentivize calibrated predictions.

Result: RLCR substantially improves calibration without sacrificing accuracy on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations across diverse datasets. It outperforms ordinary RL training and post-hoc confidence classifiers. Verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to further improve accuracy and calibration through confidence-weighted scaling methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for calibration during RL training produces more generally reliable reasoning models. RLCR successfully addresses the calibration degradation problem of standard RL approaches while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating that joint optimization of accuracy and calibration is both theoretically sound and practically effective.

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a
variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful
applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the
correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize
guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect
of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate
incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper
describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach
to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated
confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical
confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward
function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a
scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.
We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that
uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both
accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR
substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain
and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and
classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL
hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized
confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration
via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly
optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning
models.

### [224] [Semi-off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Slow-thinking Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16814)
*Junhao Shen,Haiteng Zhao,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Haian Huang,Jianfei Gao,Dahua Lin,Wenwei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOPHIA is a semi-off-policy reinforcement learning method that enhances large vision-language models with slow-thinking reasoning by combining on-policy visual understanding with off-policy reasoning from language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with complex multimodal reasoning due to limitations in adopting reinforcement learning for slow-thinking abilities. On-policy RL is restricted by initial model capabilities, while off-policy RL can cause visual hallucinations when distilling trajectories from external models with mismatched visual perception abilities.

Method: SOPHIA uses a semi-off-policy behavior model that combines on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model. It assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning, propagates visual rewards backward, and enables the LVLM to learn slow-thinking reasoning through off-policy RL algorithms using the obtained reasoning trajectories.

Result: SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% on average, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. It outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4.1 on challenging datasets, achieving 49.08% pass@1 accuracy on MathVision and 49.95% on OlympiadBench.

Conclusion: SOPHIA effectively addresses the challenges of enhancing LVLMs with slow-thinking reasoning by providing a scalable semi-off-policy RL approach. It outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy RL methods, offering better policy initialization for further training and demonstrating superior performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.

*Keen Leung,Colen Yan,Jun Yin*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: A Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework is proposed to efficiently analyze galaxy morphology from large-scale photometric surveys, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional parametric fitting methods for billions of galaxy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ongoing and future photometric surveys will generate unprecedented volumes of galaxy images requiring efficient morphological analysis methods, as traditional parametric light-profile fitting becomes computationally prohibitive for billions of sources.

Method: A Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework trained on realistic mock galaxy images from GalSim, which encodes galaxy images into low-dimensional latent representations conditioned on key morphological parameters (flux, half-light radius, Sersic index, ellipticity) to recover features in a disentangled manner while reconstructing original images.

Result: The CAE approach successfully recovers morphological features in a disentangled manner and accurately reconstructs galaxy images, demonstrating its ability to efficiently infer complex structural properties from galaxy images.

Conclusion: The CAE framework provides a powerful and computationally efficient alternative to existing parametric methods for galaxy morphological analysis, making it suitable for processing the massive datasets expected from future photometric surveys.

Abstract: Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of
galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy
morphological parameters at scale. Traditional approaches, such as parametric
light-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally
prohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a
Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and
characterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock
galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types,
photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index,
ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into
a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our
model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled
manner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate
that the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural
properties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods.

### [226] [Nonlinear Framework for Speech Bandwidth Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15970)
*Tarikul Islam Tamiti,Nursad Mamun,Anomadarshi Barua*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: NDSI-BWE introduces a novel adversarial bandwidth extension framework using seven specialized discriminators inspired by nonlinear dynamical systems and a complex-valued ConformerNeXt generator to recover high-frequency audio components, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 8x parameter reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency components are often lost due to bandwidth constraints in telecommunications and audio applications on limited resources. Existing bandwidth extension methods lack the ability to capture diverse temporal behaviors and complex dynamics present in audio signals, necessitating a more sophisticated approach that can model nonlinear dynamical characteristics.

Method: The paper proposes NDSI-BWE, an adversarial framework with seven discriminators inspired by nonlinear dynamical systems: Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD), Multi-Scale Recurrence Discriminator (MS-RD), Multi-Scale Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA), Multi-Resolution Poincaré Plot Discriminator (MR-PPD), Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD), Multi-Resolution Amplitude Discriminator (MRAD), and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD). The generator uses a complex-valued ConformerNeXt architecture with dual-stream Lattice-Net for simultaneous magnitude and phase refinement. Depth-wise convolution is employed to reduce parameters.

Result: NDSI-BWE achieves state-of-the-art performance in bandwidth extension across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective tests with five human judges. The framework demonstrates an eight-times parameter reduction compared to existing methods while maintaining superior performance in recovering high-frequency audio components.

Conclusion: The proposed NDSI-BWE framework successfully establishes a new state-of-the-art in bandwidth extension by effectively leveraging nonlinear dynamical system-inspired discriminators and a sophisticated generator architecture. The method demonstrates both computational efficiency through significant parameter reduction and superior performance in both objective and subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Recovering high-frequency components lost to bandwidth constraints is crucial
for applications ranging from telecommunications to high-fidelity audio on
limited resources. We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width
Extension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired by
nonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: a
Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity to
initial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale Recurrence
Discriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-Scale
Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variant
scale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution Poincar\'e Plot Discriminator
(MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-Period
Discriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution Amplitude
Discriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) for
capturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics. By using depth-wise
convolution at the core of the convolutional block with in each discriminators,
NDSI-BWE attains an eight-times parameter reduction. These seven discriminators
guide a complex-valued ConformerNeXt based genetor with a dual stream
Lattice-Net based architecture for simultaneous refinement of magnitude and
phase. The genertor leverage the transformer based conformer's global
dependency modeling and ConvNeXt block's local temporal modeling capability.
Across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective based texts comprises of
five human judges, NDSI-BWE establishes a new SoTA in BWE.

*Eduardo Pacheco,Atila Orhon,Berkin Durmus,Blaise Munyampirwa,Andrey Leonov*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The authors introduce SDBench, an open-source benchmark suite for speaker diarization that integrates 13 diverse datasets with consistent evaluation tools, and demonstrate its effectiveness by developing SpeakerKit, which achieves 9.6x speedup over Pyannote v3 with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speaker diarization systems show high variance in error rates across datasets and lack standardized evaluation practices, making it difficult to perform fair comparisons between different systems and enabling reproducible research in this field.

Method: The authors developed SDBench, an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets with built-in tooling for consistent evaluation. They also created SpeakerKit, an inference efficiency-focused system based on Pyannote v3, and benchmarked 6 state-of-the-art systems including commercial APIs.

Result: SpeakerKit achieved 9.6x faster inference speed compared to Pyannote v3 while maintaining comparable error rates. The benchmark revealed important trade-offs between accuracy and speed across 6 evaluated state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI API.

Conclusion: SDBench provides a standardized platform for reproducible speaker diarization evaluation that enables rapid system development and fair comparison across different approaches, facilitating future research and development in speaker diarization systems.

Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in
error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and
domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of
best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for
apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization
Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets
with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker
diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench
enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time.
To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference
efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid
execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than
Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6
state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI
API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

### [228] [Detect Any Sound: Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection with Multi-Modal Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16343)
*Pengfei Cai,Yan Song,Qing Gu,Nan Jiang,Haoyu Song,Ian McLoughlin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DASM is a query-based framework for open-vocabulary sound event detection that uses multi-modal queries (text or audio) and a dual-stream decoder to achieve better generalization to novel sound classes while maintaining localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sound event detection methods are limited to closed-set assumptions with predefined classes, and recent zero-shot approaches using audio-language models show poor performance due to lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature fusion.

Method: DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task with audio features matched against query vectors from text/audio prompts. It uses a dual-stream decoder that separates event recognition (cross-modality event decoder) and temporal localization (context network), plus an inference-time attention masking strategy leveraging semantic relations between base and novel classes.

Result: On AudioSet Strong dataset, DASM outperforms CLAP-based methods by +7.8 PSDS in open-vocabulary setting and baseline by +6.9 PSDS in closed-set setting. On cross-dataset zero-shot evaluation (DESED), it achieves 42.2 PSDS1, exceeding supervised CRNN baseline.

Conclusion: DASM successfully balances localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, demonstrating superior performance in both open-vocabulary and closed-set sound event detection tasks through its query-based framework and dual-stream architecture.

Abstract: Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a
closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined
classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by
exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from
satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature
fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a
query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries.
DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are
matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support
this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly
decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event
decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound
events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies
for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking
strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel
classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments
on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances
localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming
CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in
the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot
evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the
supervised CRNN baseline. The project page is available at

*Yuxuan He,Xiaoran Yang,Ningning Pan,Gongping Huang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A cascaded method that generates multisource binaural audio from text by using an LLM to extract temporal and spatial information, creating mono audio for each event, and then rendering them into spatially-aware binaural audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-audio generation methods only produce mono outputs, which lack spatial information necessary for immersive auditory experiences. There is a need to generate spatially-aware audio that provides realistic positioning of multiple sound sources.

Method: A cascaded approach with three stages: (1) Use a pretrained LLM to parse text into structured format with temporal and spatial details for each sound event, (2) Generate multiple mono audios with varying durations using a pretrained mono audio generation network, (3) Transform mono audios into binaural audio using a neural binaural rendering network based on spatial data, then arrange them by start times.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method achieves superior performance in both audio generation quality and spatial perceptual accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The cascaded text-to-multisource binaural audio generation method successfully addresses the limitations of mono audio generation by incorporating spatial control, enabling more immersive and realistic audio experiences with proper temporal and spatial positioning of multiple sound sources.

Abstract: Most existing text-to-audio (TTA) generation methods produce mono outputs,
neglecting essential spatial information for immersive auditory experiences. To
address this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource
binaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control.
First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a
structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a
pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with
varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into
binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data
from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times,
resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality
and spatial perceptual accuracy.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper proposes a large-scale validation method for AI-native network slicing orchestration using deep neural networks and ML algorithms to predict latency in real production testbeds, addressing the challenge of validating network slicing solutions beyond laboratory simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network slicing solutions with AI-native orchestration face validation challenges as they are typically tested only in local networks or laboratory simulations rather than real production environments. There is a need for production-ready validation methods to evaluate ML-enabled orchestration architectures that can handle heterogeneous user requirements in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors develop a network slicing prediction model using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and basic ML algorithms embedded within a network slicing architecture. They deploy a distributed database application as a network slice and evaluate the performance across two large-scale production testbeds, measuring and comparing different DNNs and ML algorithms for latency forecasting.

Result: The study demonstrates how AI-based prediction models can enhance network slicing orchestration architectures and provides performance comparisons of different DNNs and ML algorithms in real production environments. The validation method successfully operates in large-scale production testbeds rather than controlled simulations.

Conclusion: The paper presents a seamless, production-ready validation method as a viable alternative to fully controlled simulations or laboratory setups for evaluating AI-native network slicing orchestration. This approach enables more realistic assessment of ML-enabled network slicing solutions in actual production environments.

Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) realization requires AI-native orchestration
architectures to efficiently and intelligently handle heterogeneous user
requirements. To achieve this, network slicing is evolving towards a more
user-centric digital transformation, focusing on architectures that incorporate
native intelligence to enable self-managed connectivity in an integrated and
isolated manner. However, these initiatives face the challenge of validating
their results in production environments, particularly those utilizing
ML-enabled orchestration, as they are often tested in local networks or
laboratory simulations. This paper proposes a large-scale validation method
using a network slicing prediction model to forecast latency using Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) and basic ML algorithms embedded within an NS architecture,
evaluated in real large-scale production testbeds. It measures and compares the
performance of different DNNs and ML algorithms, considering a distributed
database application deployed as a network slice over two large-scale
production testbeds. The investigation highlights how AI-based prediction
models can enhance network slicing orchestration architectures and presents a
seamless, production-ready validation method as an alternative to fully

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This systematic review of 226 studies (2020-2025) compared machine learning approaches for cancer outcome prediction using PET/SPECT imaging, finding that deep radiomics features achieved highest accuracy (0.862) while fusion models had highest AUC (0.861), but identified significant methodological limitations including poor handling of class imbalance and low adherence to standardization guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The comparative performance of different machine learning approaches (handcrafted radiomics features, deep radiomics features, deep learning models, and hybrid fusion approaches) for cancer outcome prediction using PET and SPECT imaging remains inconsistent across clinical applications, necessitating a comprehensive systematic review to evaluate and compare these methods.

Method: Systematic review of 226 studies published from 2020-2025 using a comprehensive 59-item evaluation framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. Key extracted details included model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics (accuracy and AUC), with statistical analysis using ANOVA to compare performance differences.

Result: PET-based studies (95%) outperformed SPECT studies due to higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. Deep radiomics features (DRF) achieved highest mean accuracy (0.862), while fusion models yielded highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant performance differences (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Major limitations included inadequate class imbalance handling (59%), missing data issues (29%), low population diversity (19%), and only 48% adherence to IBSI standards.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant performance variations among machine learning approaches for cancer outcome prediction, with deep radiomics features and fusion models showing superior performance. However, widespread methodological limitations including poor data quality management and low standardization adherence necessitate the development of standardized pipelines, improved data quality protocols, and explainable AI methods to enable successful clinical integration.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based
methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT
imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features
(HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches
remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review
analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or
SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item
framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation
methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including
model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as
accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally
outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and
sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while
fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant
differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common
limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data
(29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI
standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines,
improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.

*Zekun Xu,Yudi Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model-agnostic approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to rerank complementary product recommendations, achieving better accuracy-diversity balance without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural network approaches for complementary product recommendation struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail items. There's a need for better methods to balance recommendation accuracy and diversity in e-commerce scenarios.

Method: The authors develop a model-agnostic approach that uses LLM-based prompting strategies to rerank candidate items from existing recommendation models. Unlike previous works that use LLMs for data preprocessing, this method directly applies LLMs to the reranking process without requiring model retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show at least 50% improvement in accuracy metrics and 2% improvement in diversity metrics on average for top recommended items. The approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations.

Conclusion: LLM-based reranking provides an effective, model-agnostic solution for improving complementary product recommendations by better balancing accuracy and diversity, offering significant performance gains without the need for model retraining.

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are
used together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in
e-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made
significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often
struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail
items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product
recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data
preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting
strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing
recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through
extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach
effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product
recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in
diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.

*Danil Gusak,Anna Volodkevich,Anton Klenitskiy,Alexey Vasilev,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates evaluation protocols for sequential recommender systems, showing that common evaluation methods like leave-one-out splitting have significant flaws (temporal leakage, unrealistic test horizons) and proposes more realistic evaluation strategies using global temporal splitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for sequential recommender systems are insufficiently developed and fail to accurately reflect real-world recommendation scenarios. The widely used leave-one-out split creates temporal leakage and unrealistically long test horizons, while global temporal splitting lacks clear definitions for sequential recommendations.

Method: The authors systematically compare different splitting strategies for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established baselines. They analyze how evaluation outcomes vary across different splitting strategies and examine the impact on model rankings and deployment decisions.

Result: The study demonstrates that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly across different splitting strategies, affecting model rankings and practical deployment decisions. The findings reveal that prevalent splits like leave-one-out may be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current evaluation protocols need improvement to better reflect real-world scenarios. The authors provide systematic comparisons to improve reproducibility in both academic and industrial settings, highlighting the importance of choosing appropriate evaluation strategies for sequential recommender systems.

Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems, ranging from lightweight
transformer-based variants to large language models, have become increasingly
prominent in academia and industry due to their strong performance in the
next-item prediction task. Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential
recommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the
corresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with
real-world scenarios.
  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it
permits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal
leakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance.
Global temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct
future periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain
loosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and
constructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between
validation and test metrics.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly
across splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical
deployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and
industrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies
for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established
baselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may
be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies. Code:

### [234] [Is memory all you need? Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058)
*Xander de Wit,Alessandro Gabbana,Michael Woodward,Yen Ting Lin,Federico Toschi,Daniel Livescu*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper develops a machine learning surrogate model based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to accurately predict Lagrangian particle trajectories in turbulence, achieving both short-term point-wise accuracy and long-term statistical stability without expensive full-field simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows for Lagrangian particle tracking are computationally expensive, and existing reduced-order models struggle to capture the complex statistical behavior of particle trajectories due to lacking access to full turbulent field interactions. There is a need for efficient surrogate models that can reproduce both short-term accuracy and long-term statistical properties.

Method: The approach uses the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to mathematically decompose the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics (depending on current state and past history) and unresolved orthogonal dynamics. A data-driven machine learning model is trained on short-time point-wise error metrics to learn the reduced-order dynamics of Lagrangian turbulence.

Result: The trained surrogate model successfully achieves point-wise accuracy for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) while maintaining stable and statistically accurate behavior at long times. The model correctly learns Lagrangian turbulence dynamics and recovers long-time statistical behavior at test time.

Conclusion: The Mori-Zwanzig based machine learning approach successfully creates surrogate models that can reproduce complex Lagrangian particle trajectories in turbulence with both short-term accuracy and long-term statistical stability, opening new applications such as control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulent flows.

Abstract: The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in
mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their
trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the
development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without
incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the
full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because
reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with
the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques
can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the
reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a
surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian
trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions
(with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long
times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes
a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved
dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set
of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees
of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order
model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to
correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the
long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up
a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian
agents in turbulence.

*Junqi Yin,Mijanur Palash,M. Paul Laiu,Muralikrishnan Gopalakrishnan Meena,John Gounley,Stephen M. de Bruyn Kops,Feiyi Wang,Ramanan Sankaran,Pei Zhang*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Researchers developed a multiscale hierarchical Turbulence Transformer with novel RingX parallelism that achieves 1.1 EFLOPS on 32,768 GPUs and successfully captures turbulence from large scales down to dissipative eddies for the first time in AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turbulence modeling is critical for multiphysics applications (aerodynamics, fusion, combustion) but capturing its multiscale characteristics remains extremely challenging. Existing deep learning models struggle with the extreme-resolution data (billions to trillions of grid points) required to represent turbulence accurately, making reliable predictions of multiphysics interactions computationally prohibitive.

Method: The authors developed a multiscale hierarchical Turbulence Transformer that reduces sequence length from billions to millions of elements, combined with a novel RingX sequence parallelism approach for scalable long-context learning. The model was implemented and tested on the Frontier supercomputer using up to 32,768 AMD GPUs.

Result: The model achieved excellent performance up to 1.1 EFLOPS (exaFLOPS) on 32,768 AMD GPUs with 94% scaling efficiency. This represents the first AI model capable of capturing small-scale turbulent eddies down to the dissipative range, enabling unprecedented resolution in turbulence modeling.

Conclusion: This work presents a breakthrough in AI-based turbulence modeling by successfully combining hierarchical transformers with advanced parallelism techniques to achieve exascale performance. The ability to capture turbulence across all scales, including dissipative eddies, opens new possibilities for accurate multiphysics simulations in critical applications like aerodynamics, fusion, and combustion.

Abstract: Turbulence plays a crucial role in multiphysics applications, including
aerodynamics, fusion, and combustion. Accurately capturing turbulence's
multiscale characteristics is essential for reliable predictions of
multiphysics interactions, but remains a grand challenge even for exascale
supercomputers and advanced deep learning models. The extreme-resolution data
required to represent turbulence, ranging from billions to trillions of grid
points, pose prohibitive computational costs for models based on architectures
like vision transformers. To address this challenge, we introduce a multiscale
hierarchical Turbulence Transformer that reduces sequence length from billions
to a few millions and a novel RingX sequence parallelism approach that enables
scalable long-context learning. We perform scaling and science runs on the
Frontier supercomputer. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance up to
1.1 EFLOPS on 32,768 AMD GPUs, with a scaling efficiency of 94%. To our
knowledge, this is the first AI model for turbulence that can capture
small-scale eddies down to the dissipative range.

### [236] [Combining Cost-Constrained Runtime Monitors for AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15886)
*Tim Tian Hua,James Baskerville,Henri Lemoine,Mia Hopman,Aryan Bhatt,Tyler Tracy*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper develops an algorithm for optimally combining multiple AI runtime monitors to maximize detection of harmful outputs while staying within budget constraints, achieving more than double the recall rate compared to baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems need effective monitoring to detect and prevent harmful actions at runtime. Since both running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, there's a need for principled methods to combine multiple monitors efficiently while maximizing safety under budget constraints.

Method: The authors develop an algorithm that exhaustively searches over when and which monitors to call, then allocates safety interventions based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma. The approach focuses on likelihood ratios and strategically trades off spending between monitors and interventions to optimize the monitoring protocol.

Result: The algorithm more than doubles the recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review setting. The study also demonstrates that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using either monitor alone, showing clear benefits of the multi-monitor approach.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled methodology for combining existing monitors to detect undesirable AI behavior in cost-sensitive settings, offering significant improvements in safety detection while respecting budget constraints.

Abstract: Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In
this paper, we study how to combine multiple runtime monitors into a single
monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of
applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall).
Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the
protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the
monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the
most efficient protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and
which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the
Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically
trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more
than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review
setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using
either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for
combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive
settings.

### [237] [Characterizing Online Activities Contributing to Suicide Mortality among Youth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16185)
*Aparna Ananthasubramaniam,Elyse J. Thulin,Viktoryia Kalesnikava,Silas Falde,Jonathan Kertawidjaja,Lily Johns,Alejandro Rodríguez-Putnam,Emma Spring,Kara Zivin,Briana Mezuk*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study analyzed 29,124 death investigation summaries from 2013-2022 to identify 12 types of online activities related to youth suicide risk, developed a machine learning framework to detect these patterns at scale, and found associations with demographic factors and increased prevalence during COVID-19 lockdowns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising youth suicide rates and the need to understand how online experiences contribute to this public health crisis, particularly given the limited understanding of less explicit online indicators of suicide risk beyond direct expressions of suicidality.

Method: Mixed-methods approach combining thematic analysis of 29,124 open text summaries from death investigations (2013-2022) to identify online risk factors, followed by development of a zero-shot learning framework to model and analyze these themes at scale across different demographic groups and time periods.

Result: Identified 12 types of online activities related to suicide risk spanning harm to self/others, interpersonal interactions, online activity levels, and life events. Found associations between these themes and decedent characteristics (age, means of death, interpersonal problems) and increased prevalence during 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns.

Conclusion: The study reveals opportunities for developing suicide prevention interventions targeting less explicit online indicators of risk by combining suicide theories with computational research methods, beyond current digital platform efforts that focus mainly on direct expressions of suicidality.

Abstract: The recent rise in youth suicide highlights the urgent need to understand how
online experiences contribute to this public health issue. Our mixed-methods
approach responds to this challenge by developing a set of themes focused on
risk factors for suicide mortality in online spaces among youth ages 10-24, and
a framework to model these themes at scale. Using 29,124 open text summaries of
death investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to
identify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or
next of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death. We then
develop a zero-shot learning framework to model these 12 themes at scale, and
analyze variation in these themes by decedent characteristics and over time.
Our work uncovers several online activities related to harm to self, harm to
others, interpersonal interactions, activity levels online, and life events,
which correspond to different phases of suicide risk from two prominent suicide
theories. We find an association between these themes and decedent
characteristics like age, means of death, and interpersonal problems, and many
themes became more prevalent during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns. While digital
spaces have taken some steps to address expressions of suicidality online, our
work illustrates the opportunities for developing interventions related to less
explicit indicators of suicide risk by combining suicide theories with
computational research.

### [238] [Disability Across Cultures: A Human-Centered Audit of Ableism in Western and Indic LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16130)
*Mahika Phutane,Aditya Vashistha*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study examines how Western and Indian LLMs detect ableist speech compared to people with disabilities from both regions, revealing significant cultural biases in AI models' understanding of disability-related harm across different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People with disabilities face high levels of online discrimination, especially in India. While LLMs are increasingly used to detect hate speech, most research focuses on Western contexts. The authors wanted to investigate whether these models can adequately recognize ableist harm in non-Western contexts like India, and whether localized Indian language models perform better.

Method: The researchers translated an ableist speech dataset to Hindi and tested eight LLMs (four Western: GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama; four Indian: Krutrim, Nanda, Gajendra, Airavata) to score and explain ableism. They also recruited 175 people with disabilities from the U.S. and India to perform the same evaluation task for comparison.

Result: Western LLMs consistently overestimated ableist harm while Indian LLMs underestimated it. All LLMs showed more tolerance for ableism when expressed in Hindi and applied Western frameworks of harm assessment. Indian people with disabilities interpreted harm differently, focusing on intention, relationality, and resilience, with emphasis on educating perpetrators rather than punishment.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates significant cultural biases in AI models' understanding of ableism and highlights the need for global, inclusive standards that center local disability experiences in AI system design and evaluation. Current models inadequately serve non-Western contexts and disability communities.

Abstract: People with disabilities (PwD) experience disproportionately high levels of
discrimination and hate online, particularly in India, where entrenched stigma
and limited resources intensify these challenges. Large language models (LLMs)
are increasingly used to identify and mitigate online hate, yet most research
on online ableism focuses on Western audiences with Western AI models. Are
these models adequately equipped to recognize ableist harm in non-Western
places like India? Do localized, Indic language models perform better? To
investigate, we adopted and translated a publicly available ableist speech
dataset to Hindi, and prompted eight LLMs--four developed in the U.S. (GPT-4,
Gemini, Claude, Llama) and four in India (Krutrim, Nanda, Gajendra,
Airavata)--to score and explain ableism. In parallel, we recruited 175 PwD from
both the U.S. and India to perform the same task, revealing stark differences
between groups. Western LLMs consistently overestimated ableist harm, while
Indic LLMs underestimated it. Even more concerning, all LLMs were more tolerant
of ableism when it was expressed in Hindi and asserted Western framings of
ableist harm. In contrast, Indian PwD interpreted harm through intention,
relationality, and resilience--emphasizing a desire to inform and educate
perpetrators. This work provides groundwork for global, inclusive standards of
ableism, demonstrating the need to center local disability experiences in the
design and evaluation of AI systems.

### [239] [The Impact of Pseudo-Science in Financial Loans Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16182)
*Bruno Scarone,Ricardo Baeza-Yates*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper examines how pseudo-scientific assumptions and survival bias in machine learning models for financial lending create societal harm while creating an illusion of improvement over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand the societal impact of biased machine learning models in high-stakes applications like financial lending, particularly how pseudo-scientific assumptions and survival bias affect both accuracy and social fairness.

Method: The researchers analyze machine learning models for loan risk prediction by evaluating both accuracy metrics and social costs, comparing socially optimal models against standard approaches across commonly used learning methods and datasets.

Result: The study finds that socially optimal models don't significantly sacrifice accuracy in loan prediction tasks. It reveals a concerning dynamic where models with survival bias show slight accuracy deterioration but improved recall and precision over time, creating a false impression of system improvement while actually increasing unfairness.

Conclusion: The research concludes that machine learning systems in financial lending can maintain similar accuracy while being more socially responsible, but warns that traditional performance metrics can mask growing bias and unfairness, creating dangerous illusions of improvement in biased systems.

Abstract: We study the societal impact of pseudo-scientific assumptions for predicting
the behavior of people in a straightforward application of machine learning to
risk prediction in financial lending. This use case also exemplifies the impact
of survival bias in loan return prediction. We analyze the models in terms of
their accuracy and social cost, showing that the socially optimal model may not
imply a significant accuracy loss for this downstream task. Our results are
verified for commonly used learning methods and datasets. Our findings also
show that there is a natural dynamic when training models that suffer survival
bias where accuracy slightly deteriorates, and whose recall and precision
improves with time. These results act as an illusion, leading the observer to
believe that the system is getting better, when in fact the model is suffering
from increasingly more unfairness and survival bias.

### [240] [PRAC3 (Privacy, Reputation, Accountability, Consent, Credit, Compensation): Long Tailed Risks of Voice Actors in AI Data-Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16247)
*Tanusree Sharma,Yihao Zhou,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper examines the risks faced by voice actors whose voices were used in early audio datasets like LibriSpeech and are now being synthetically replicated without adequate protection, proposing the PRAC3 framework to address privacy, reputation, accountability, consent, credit, and compensation concerns in the synthetic voice economy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice actors who contributed to early large-scale audio datasets are now exposed to significant risks from synthetic voice replication, including reputational harm, financial fraud, and legal fallout, while existing ethical frameworks (C3: Consent, Credit, Compensation) fail to address these emergent threats involving decontextualized vocal identities.

Method: Qualitative interviews with 20 professional voice actors to understand their experiences and concerns regarding synthetic voice replication, combined with analysis of existing ethical frameworks to develop an expanded governance model.

Result: The study reveals that voice actors face threats ranging from reputational damage (erotic content, offensive messaging) to accountability breakdowns in high-stakes scenarios (financial fraud, misinformation). Most actors lack legal representation or union protection, creating vulnerability in the synthetic voice economy.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the PRAC3 framework (Privacy, Reputation, Accountability, Consent, Credit, Compensation) as an expansion of existing C3 frameworks, arguing that voice requires special governance as both biometric identifier and creative labor, with emphasis on restoring creator agency, ensuring traceability, and establishing enforceable ethical boundaries.

Abstract: Early large-scale audio datasets, such as LibriSpeech, were built with
hundreds of individual contributors whose voices were instrumental in the
development of speech technologies, including audiobooks and voice assistants.
Yet, a decade later, these same contributions have exposed voice actors to a
range of risks. While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit,
and Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks
involving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context,
authorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional
voice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without
enforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond
reputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive
political messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about
accountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that
are deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation
campaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal
fallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or
union protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the
PRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation,
Accountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of
data used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy
risks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm
arises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be
reimagined AI Data ecosystems. We argue that voice, as both a biometric
identifier and creative labor, demands governance models that restore creator
agency, ensure traceability, and establish enforceable boundaries for ethical
reuse.

*Octavian M. Machidon*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper examines the ethical challenges of AI-driven recommender systems and argues that current technical approaches are insufficient, proposing a comprehensive human-centered framework that integrates interdisciplinary perspectives, regulation, and education to protect human autonomy and well-being.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven recommender systems have become central to digital environments and social interactions, actively shaping individual experiences across platforms. Despite their ubiquity, the ethical implications remain insufficiently explored, with growing concerns over privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being that existing technical solutions cannot adequately address.

Method: The paper employs ethical and anthropological analysis to examine recommender systems, critiquing existing algorethics approaches and developing a comprehensive framework that integrates interdisciplinary perspectives, regulatory strategies, and educational initiatives for human-centered RS design.

Result: The analysis reveals that recommender systems inherently reduce human complexity to quantifiable dimensions, exploit user vulnerabilities, and prioritize engagement over well-being. Current ethical approaches like algorethics are found to be necessary but ultimately inadequate for addressing these fundamental issues.

Conclusion: Addressing the ethical challenges of recommender systems requires moving beyond purely technical solutions toward a comprehensive human-centered design framework that fosters human autonomy and societal flourishing through interdisciplinary collaboration, regulatory intervention, and educational initiatives.

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by
AI-driven recommender systems (RSs), which have become central to shaping
digital environments and social interactions. By curating personalized content,
RSs do not merely reflect user preferences but actively construct individual
experiences across social media, entertainment platforms, and e-commerce.
Despite their ubiquity, the ethical implications of RSs remain insufficiently
explored, even as concerns over privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being
intensify. I argue that existing ethical approaches, including algorethics, the
effort to embed ethical principles into algorithmic design, are necessary but
ultimately inadequate. RSs inherently reduce human complexity to quantifiable
dimensions, exploit user vulnerabilities, and prioritize engagement over
well-being. Addressing these concerns requires moving beyond purely technical
solutions. I propose a comprehensive framework for human-centered RS design,
integrating interdisciplinary perspectives, regulatory strategies, and
educational initiatives to ensure AI systems foster rather than undermine human
autonomy and societal flourishing.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: UTR-STCNet is a Transformer-based deep learning model that predicts mRNA translational efficiency from variable-length 5'UTR sequences using saliency-aware token clustering and guided attention mechanisms, outperforming existing methods while providing biological interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for predicting translational efficiency from 5'UTR sequences are limited by fixed input lengths and poor interpretability, hindering their ability to understand translation regulation and design effective therapeutic mRNAs.

Method: The authors developed UTR-STCNet, which combines a Saliency-Aware Token Clustering (SATC) module that aggregates nucleotide tokens into multi-scale semantic units based on saliency scores, and a Saliency-Guided Transformer (SGT) block that captures local and distal regulatory dependencies using lightweight attention mechanisms.

Result: UTR-STCNet consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in predicting mean ribosome load (MRL) across three benchmark datasets, while successfully recovering known functional elements like upstream AUGs and Kozak motifs, demonstrating both superior performance and biological interpretability.

Conclusion: UTR-STCNet provides an efficient and interpretable solution for modeling variable-length 5'UTRs without input truncation or increased computational cost, offering potential for mechanistic insights into translation regulation and applications in therapeutic mRNA design.

Abstract: Understanding how 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) regulate mRNA translation
is critical for controlling protein expression and designing effective
therapeutic mRNAs. While recent deep learning models have shown promise in
predicting translational efficiency from 5'UTR sequences, most are constrained
by fixed input lengths and limited interpretability. We introduce UTR-STCNet, a
Transformer-based architecture for flexible and biologically grounded modeling
of variable-length 5'UTRs. UTR-STCNet integrates a Saliency-Aware Token
Clustering (SATC) module that iteratively aggregates nucleotide tokens into
multi-scale, semantically meaningful units based on saliency scores. A
Saliency-Guided Transformer (SGT) block then captures both local and distal
regulatory dependencies using a lightweight attention mechanism. This combined
architecture achieves efficient and interpretable modeling without input
truncation or increased computational cost. Evaluated across three benchmark
datasets, UTR-STCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
predicting mean ribosome load (MRL), a key proxy for translational efficiency.
Moreover, the model recovers known functional elements such as upstream AUGs
and Kozak motifs, highlighting its potential for mechanistic insight into
translation regulation.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUARD, a lightweight framework that improves the robustness of learning-augmented caching algorithms to 2H_k + 2 while maintaining 1-consistency and O(1) overhead per request.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-augmented caching algorithms face a trade-off between consistency and robustness - naive algorithms achieve ideal 1-consistency but lack robustness guarantees, while current robustification methods either sacrifice 1-consistency or add significant computational overhead.

Method: The authors develop GUARD, a lightweight robustification framework that can be applied to a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms. The framework enhances robustness while preserving the original algorithm's 1-consistency and maintaining O(1) additional per-request overhead.

Result: GUARD achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness (1-consistency and 2H_k + 2 robustness) with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: GUARD successfully addresses the consistency-robustness trade-off in learning-augmented caching by providing a lightweight framework that maintains ideal consistency while significantly improving robustness guarantees, validated through comprehensive experimental evaluation.

Abstract: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a
sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented
caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness
guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency
or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce
\textsc{Guard}, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the
robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k +
2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. \textsc{Guard} achieves the current
best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the
original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across
multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness
of \textsc{Guard} in practice.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach using conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to synthesize realistic cardiac CT frame pairs with dense 3D flow field annotations, addressing the challenge of obtaining labeled data for cardiac motion estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven cardiac motion estimation methods require vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth motion annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain in practice, creating a significant bottleneck for developing accurate cardiac motion estimation models.

Method: The authors propose a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism that generates 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. The generated flow field is then applied to warp the input frame, creating realistic pairs of cardiac CT frames that simulate myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle.

Result: The method successfully generates realistically looking pairs of cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations, providing fully annotated data samples with optical flow ground-truth annotations that can serve as training data for motion estimation models.

Conclusion: The proposed data generation pipeline enables training and validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models while substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations, potentially advancing cardiac motion estimation in CT imaging for better cardiac function assessment and surgical planning.

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is
critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven
methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they
rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion
annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation,
we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of
cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.
  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which
incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained
to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the
generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that
simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These
pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT
annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and
validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for
substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations.

TL;DR: QANA is a quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture that enables efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices, achieving 91.6% accuracy on HAM10000 dataset while reducing inference latency by 94.6% and energy consumption by 98.6% compared to GPU-based CNNs when deployed on neuromorphic hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skin lesion classification systems face significant challenges when deployed on edge devices due to computational, energy, and privacy constraints, making accessible dermatological care difficult to achieve in resource-limited environments.

Method: QANA integrates ghost modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for robust feature representation, combined with a quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations that enable seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) for deployment on neuromorphic platforms.

Result: QANA achieved 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 82.4% macro F1 on HAM10000 dataset, and 90.8%/81.7% on clinical dataset, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models. When deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, it achieved 1.5ms inference latency and 1.7mJ energy per image.

Conclusion: QANA demonstrates effectiveness for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical analysis in edge environments, reducing inference latency and energy use by over 94.6%/98.6% compared to GPU-based CNNs while maintaining competitive accuracy for skin lesion classification.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical
for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to
computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel
quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion
classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost

robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference.
Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable
seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on
neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a
real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6\% Top-1 accuracy and
82.4\% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8\% / 81.7\% on the clinical dataset,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair
comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5\,ms
inference latency and 1.7\,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and
energy use by over 94.6\%/98.6\% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing
state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical
analysis in edge environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges from anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric data. While recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve excellent results, they add significant complexity.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging
due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric
data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art
results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a
Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance
segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key
innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that
enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale
Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via
multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available
benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that
MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of
87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing
leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and
ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and
computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest
that MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. Source code is available at:

### [247] [SFNet: A Spatio-Frequency Domain Deep Learning Network for Efficient Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16267)
*Xinyue Yang,Meiliang Liu,Yunfang Xu,Xiaoxiao Yang,Zhengye Si,Zijin Li,Zhiwen Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SFNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework that combines both spatial and frequency domain information from 3D MRI scans to improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, achieving 95.1% accuracy while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD diagnostic models typically extract features from only a single domain (spatial or frequency), limiting their ability to fully capture complex neuroimaging characteristics. While MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, most studies combining dual-domain analysis are confined to 2D MRI, leaving 3D MRI dual-domain analysis unexplored.

Method: The paper introduces Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), which integrates: (1) an enhanced dense convolutional network for extracting local spatial features, (2) a global frequency module for capturing frequency-domain representations, and (3) a novel multi-scale attention module to refine spatial feature extraction. This creates an end-to-end framework that simultaneously processes both spatial and frequency information from 3D MRI.

Result: SFNet achieved 95.1% accuracy in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases on the ADNI dataset, outperforming existing baseline methods while also reducing computational overhead compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: SFNet successfully demonstrates that combining spatial and frequency domain information in 3D MRI analysis significantly improves AD diagnosis performance. The framework represents the first end-to-end approach to leverage dual-domain information for 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis, achieving superior accuracy with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is
essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial
and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain
and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most
existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting
their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the
disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,
they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain
analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework
that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to
enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense
convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency
module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a
novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial
feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ANDI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines
and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and
AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.

*Jinquan Guan,Junhong Guo,Qi Chen,Jian Chen,Yongkang Cai,Yilin He,Zhiquan Huang,Yan Wang,Yutong Xie*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Researchers introduce Multi-OSCC, a comprehensive histopathology dataset of 1,325 OSCC patients with multi-magnification images for both diagnostic and prognostic tasks, achieving excellent performance with top models reaching 94.72% AUC for recurrence prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSCC datasets have limited patient cohorts and narrow focus on either diagnostic or prognostic tasks, hindering the development of comprehensive and generalizable deep learning models for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis of this aggressive malignancy.

Method: Created Multi-OSCC dataset with 1,325 patients, each represented by six high-resolution histopathology images at different magnifications (x200, x400, x1000) covering core and edge tumor regions. Systematically evaluated various visual encoders, multi-image fusion techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks across six clinical tasks.

Result: Top-performing models achieved excellent results with 94.72% AUC for recurrence prediction and 81.23% for tumor differentiation, with all tasks exceeding 70% AUC. Stain normalization helped diagnostic tasks but hurt recurrence prediction. Multi-task learning showed 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to single-task models.

Conclusion: The Multi-OSCC dataset successfully addresses limitations of existing OSCC datasets by providing comprehensive multi-task annotations and multi-magnification images. While achieving strong performance, the study reveals challenges in multi-task learning and the nuanced effects of preprocessing techniques across different clinical tasks.

Abstract: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy
where deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance
clinical assessments.However, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often
suffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic
or prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and
generalizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new
histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both
diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each
patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at
x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the
core and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six
critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis
(LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE),
and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically
evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion
techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our
analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve
excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and
81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization
benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3)
Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to
single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of
balancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we
publicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at

*Yutong Du,Zicheng Liu,Bazargul Matkerim,Changyou Li,Yali Zong,Bo Qi,Jingwei Kou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A physics-driven neural network (PDNN) approach for inverse scattering problems that avoids generalization issues by training on scattered field data alone, achieving high reconstruction accuracy and stability without requiring large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for inverse scattering problems heavily rely on large datasets and suffer from limited generalization capabilities, creating a need for a more robust approach that can work with minimal data while maintaining accuracy.

Method: A physics-driven neural network (PDNN) that iteratively updates solutions by optimizing hyperparameters through a loss function incorporating scattered field constraints and prior scatterer information. The method identifies subregions containing scatterers to improve imaging efficiency and trains using only scattered field inputs and corresponding computed fields.

Result: Numerical and experimental results show high reconstruction accuracy and strong stability, even for challenging cases involving composite lossy scatterers. The method demonstrates improved performance compared to traditional data-driven approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed PDNN scheme successfully addresses the generalization problem of data-driven neural networks for inverse scattering problems by incorporating physics constraints directly into the training process, providing a more robust and efficient solution for scatterer reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been proposed for solving
inverse scattering problems (ISPs), but most of them heavily rely on data and
suffer from limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, a new solving
scheme is proposed where the solution is iteratively updated following the
updating of the physics-driven neural network (PDNN), the hyperparameters of
which are optimized by minimizing the loss function which incorporates the
constraints from the collected scattered fields and the prior information about
scatterers. Unlike data-driven neural network solvers, PDNN is trained only
requiring the input of collected scattered fields and the computation of
scattered fields corresponding to predicted solutions, thus avoids the
generalization problem. Moreover, to accelerate the imaging efficiency, the
subregion enclosing the scatterers is identified. Numerical and experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high reconstruction accuracy
and strong stability, even when dealing with composite lossy scatterers.

*Cedric Zöllner,Simon Reiß,Alexander Jaus,Amroalalaa Sholi,Ralf Sodian,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper develops AI-based semantic segmentation models to support preoperative planning for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) surgery by automatically identifying and measuring relevant anatomical structures in CT scans, achieving improved performance through fine-grained pseudo-labeling and adapted loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical doctors need support during preoperative planning for TAVR surgeries when assessing medical images. Current methods require manual identification and measurement of anatomical structures in CT scans, which could be automated using AI to improve efficiency and accuracy in surgical planning.

Method: The authors derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained anatomical information to train semantic segmentation models. They propose an adaptation to the loss function during training to improve model performance in identifying anatomical structures relevant to TAVR procedures in computed tomography scans.

Result: The proposed method achieved a +1.27% Dice score increase in segmentation performance compared to baseline approaches. The models successfully quantify and make measurable the relevant anatomical structures needed for TAVR preoperative planning in CT scans.

Conclusion: AI-based semantic segmentation models can effectively support medical doctors in TAVR preoperative planning by automatically identifying and measuring relevant anatomical structures in CT scans. The fine-grained pseudo-labeling approach and adapted loss function improve segmentation accuracy, making the method viable for clinical application.

Abstract: When preoperative planning for surgeries is conducted on the basis of medical
images, artificial intelligence methods can support medical doctors during
assessment. In this work, we consider medical guidelines for preoperative
planning of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and identify
tasks, that may be supported via semantic segmentation models by making
relevant anatomical structures measurable in computed tomography scans. We
first derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained
anatomical information, in order to train segmentation models and quantify how
well they are able to find these structures in the scans. Furthermore, we
propose an adaptation to the loss function in training these segmentation
models and through this achieve a +1.27% Dice increase in performance. Our
fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels and the computed tomography scans we
build upon are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16274176.

*Xiaojiao Xiao,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PHMDiff introduces a Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model for medical image synthesis that uses multi-scale hierarchical approach with randomly masked training to generate high-quality medical images across different modalities, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image synthesis is crucial for clinical workflows to address missing imaging modalities caused by extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and intolerance to contrast agents. Current methods lack detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.

Method: The paper proposes PHMDiff, a Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model that employs: (1) multi-scale hierarchical approach for detailed control, (2) randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to accelerate diffusion training, (3) Transformer-based diffusion process with cross-granularity regularization, and (4) modeling mutual information consistency across granularity latent spaces to enhance pixel-level perceptual accuracy.

Result: PHMDiff achieves superior performance on two challenging datasets with better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to other methods. The model produces high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component.

Conclusion: PHMDiff demonstrates significant advantages as a multi-scale image synthesis framework for medical imaging modalities, successfully balancing detail fidelity and overall structure while achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical image synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows,
addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such
as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and
intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis
network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which
employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over
synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.
Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to
speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall
structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process
incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information
consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing
pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images
with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the
contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale

### [252] [Improving U-Net Confidence on TEM Image Data with L2-Regularization, Transfer Learning, and Deep Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16779)
*Aiden Ochoa,Xinyuan Xu,Xing Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of automated nanoscale defect detection in TEM images by applying transfer learning from pre-trained natural image models, achieving a 57% improvement in defect detection rate for grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TEM image analysis faces significant challenges due to nanoscale defects exhibiting greater variation than conventional photographs, complex contrast mechanisms, intricate defect structures, limited labeled data, and high annotation error rates, making traditional machine learning approaches less effective.

Method: The authors employed transfer learning using pre-trained encoders from natural image models with L2-regularization to focus on simpler, more reliable cues rather than semantically complex features. They also developed novel evaluation metrics independent of annotation accuracy to better assess model performance.

Result: The approach achieved a 57% improvement in defect detection rate for grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images. The study demonstrated that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers, and that conventional metrics like F1-score are inadequate due to annotation errors.

Conclusion: Transfer learning from pre-trained natural image models significantly improves nanoscale defect detection in TEM images by leveraging simpler, more reliable features. Novel evaluation metrics independent of annotation accuracy are necessary for proper assessment, and deep layer fine-tuning is essential for achieving model confidence in this domain.

Abstract: With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated
approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional
photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due
to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These
challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of
annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning
model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we
examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for
natural images.
  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,
semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable
cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement
cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which
can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we
introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation
accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we
found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate,
which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset
used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only
achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.

*Yushuo Niu,Tianyu Li,Yuanyuan Zhu,Qian Yang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning architecture that reframes semantic segmentation as change detection for automated analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, achieving 10.22% improvement over conventional methods in detecting small features during solid-state reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods for semantic segmentation in TEM imaging face limitations including scarcity of labeled data, visually ambiguous features, and challenges with small-object detection. There is a need for automated, high-precision analysis of dynamically evolving features in operando characterization of solid-state reactions using in-situ TEM.

Method: MTDN uses a Siamese network architecture with U-Net backbone that reconceptualizes segmentation as a change detection problem. It processes paired images to capture feature changes, employs multi-task learning to leverage correlations between physical features, and is designed to work effectively with minimal labeled data.

Result: MTDN demonstrated significant advantages over conventional segmentation models when evaluated on in-situ environmental TEM videos of filamentous carbon gasification. The method achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional models, particularly excelling in accurately delineating fine structural features and predicting small, visually ambiguous physical features.

Conclusion: MTDN successfully bridges key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis, enabling automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental settings. The approach advances the field by transforming in-situ TEM imaging into an effective tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions.

Abstract: Transforming in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging into a
tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions
requires automated, high-precision semantic segmentation of dynamically
evolving features. However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic
segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data,
visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning
architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change
detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net
backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively
utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN
utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between
physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ
environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN
demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models,
particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN
achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models
in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges
several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis,
advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental
settings.

*Yuqi Zhao,Giovanni Dettori,Matteo Boffa,Luca Vassio,Marco Mellia*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper critically reassesses BERT-inspired representation learning models for encrypted traffic classification, revealing that their claimed high performance (up to 98% accuracy) is due to data preparation flaws that create spurious correlations, and proposes Pcap-Encoder as a more robust alternative along with improved evaluation methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The explosion of BERT-inspired representation learning models for traffic classification claims impressive performance, but these claims need critical reassessment from a networking expert perspective to identify potential flaws in evaluation methodology and model design.

Method: The authors conducted extensive analysis of existing representation learning models for traffic classification, identified data preparation problems that create spurious correlations, and developed Pcap-Encoder - a Language Model-based representation learning model specifically designed to extract features from protocol headers.

Result: The study revealed that reported high performance is heavily influenced by data preparation problems allowing models to find shortcuts through spurious feature-label correlations. When these shortcuts are removed (as in real scenarios), the models perform poorly. Pcap-Encoder provides instrumental representation for traffic classification but has complexity issues for practical deployment.

Conclusion: The findings expose fundamental flaws in dataset preparation and model training for traffic classification, calling for better test design and more rigorous benchmarking. The authors propose a correct evaluation methodology to address these issues and stress the need for more conscious evaluation practices in this field.

Abstract: Recently we have witnessed the explosion of proposals that, inspired by
Language Models like BERT, exploit Representation Learning models to create
traffic representations. All of them promise astonishing performance in
encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a
networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through
extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily
influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy
shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during
fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts
are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also
introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we
specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder
appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for
traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in
practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model
training, calling for a better and more conscious test design. We propose a
correct evaluation methodology and stress the need for rigorous benchmarking.

*Zied Jenhani,Mounir Bensalem,Jasenka Dizdarević,Admela Jukan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper presents the first end-to-end testbed for evaluating split learning performance on ultra-low-power IoT devices using ESP32-S3 boards, comparing different wireless communication protocols for TinyML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning inference on ultra-low-power edge/IoT devices is severely constrained by tight memory and compute budgets of microcontrollers. While split learning can address this by offloading part of the computation, its performance on constrained devices with low-power wireless protocols remains largely unexplored.

Method: The authors built an end-to-end TinyML + split learning testbed using ESP32-S3 boards. They benchmarked a quantized 8-bit MobileNetV2 image recognition model that is partitioned and deployed via over-the-air updates. They compared performance across different wireless communication methods: ESP-NOW, BLE, UDP/IP, and TCP/IP on identical hardware.

Result: Splitting the model after block_16_project_BN layer generates a 5.66 kB tensor. UDP achieves 3.2 ms transmission time with 5.8s steady-state round-trip latency. ESP-NOW provides the best RTT performance at 3.7s, while BLE extends battery life but increases latency beyond 10s.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that split learning is viable for ultra-low-power IoT devices, with ESP-NOW offering the best latency performance and BLE providing better energy efficiency at the cost of increased latency. The testbed provides valuable insights for optimizing split learning deployments in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Running deep learning inference directly on ultra-low-power edge/IoT nodes
has been limited by the tight memory and compute budgets of microcontrollers.
Split learning (SL) addresses this limitation in which it executes part of the
inference process on the sensor and off-loads the remainder to a companion
device. In the context of constrained devices and the related impact of
low-power, over-the-air transport protocols, the performance of split learning
remains largely unexplored. TO the best of our knowledge, this paper presents
the first end-to-end TinyML + SL testbed built on Espressif ESP32-S3 boards,
designed to benchmark the over-the-air performance of split learning TinyML in
edge/IoT environments. We benchmark the performance of a MobileNetV2 image
recognition model, which is quantized to 8-bit integers, partitioned, and
delivered to the nodes via over-the-air updates. The intermediate activations
are exchanged through different wireless communication methods: ESP-NOW, BLE,
and traditional UDP/IP and TCP/IP, enabling a head-to-head comparison on
identical hardware. Measurements show that splitting the model after
block_16_project_BN layer generates a 5.66 kB tensor that traverses the link in
3.2 ms, when UDP is used, achieving a steady-state round-trip latency of 5.8 s.
ESP-NOW presents the most favorable RTT performance 3.7 s; BLE extends battery
life further but increases latency beyond 10s.

### [256] [Automated Design of Structured Variational Quantum Circuits with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16001)
*Gloria Turati,Simone Foderà,Riccardo Nembrini,Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema,Paolo Cremonesi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces two reinforcement learning-based methods (RLVQC Global and RLVQC Block) for automatically designing variational quantum circuit ansatzes, treating circuit synthesis as a sequential decision-making problem and demonstrating superior performance over traditional QAOA on combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising for near-term quantum hardware, but their effectiveness heavily depends on circuit ansatz design, which is typically done using heuristic methods. There's a need for systematic approaches to automatically discover optimal circuit structures tailored for specific problems.

Method: The authors formulate variational quantum circuit synthesis as a sequential decision-making problem and propose two reinforcement learning methods: RLVQC Block (which generalizes QAOA by discovering two-qubit blocks applied to interacting qubit pairs) and RLVQC Global (which adds gates without structural constraints). Both methods use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with empirical measurement outcomes as state observations.

Result: Both RLVQC methods show strong performance on QUBO instances from graph-based optimization problems. RLVQC Block consistently outperforms QAOA and generally surpasses RLVQC Global, producing circuits with depth comparable to QAOA. RLVQC Global can find significantly shorter circuits than the other methods.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning is an effective tool for discovering new ansatz structures tailored for specific problems. The optimal circuit design strategy lies between rigid predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, providing a favorable trade-off between structure and adaptability.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches
for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly
depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically
constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of
variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where
gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we
introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC
Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates
ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit
pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates
unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt
the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement
outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed
methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based
optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong
results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally
surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth
comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly
shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be
an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific
problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid
predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a
favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.

### [257] [Minor Embedding for Quantum Annealing with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16004)
*Riccardo Nembrini,Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema,Paolo Cremonesi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Proximal Policy Optimization to solve the minor embedding problem in Quantum Annealing, where problem graphs need to be mapped onto sparse quantum processor topologies. The RL agent learns to sequentially map variables to qubits and demonstrates good performance on both Chimera and Zephyr hardware topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minor embedding in Quantum Annealing is computationally expensive and scales poorly with problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often tailored to specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and lack generalizability. There's a need for a flexible, general-purpose approach that can adapt to different graph structures and hardware architectures.

Method: The authors treat minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem and employ Reinforcement Learning with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent. The agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping problem variables to hardware qubits. They test this approach on both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs using two hardware topologies: Chimera and Zephyr.

Result: The RL agent consistently produces valid minor embeddings with reasonably efficient qubit usage, particularly performing well on the more modern Zephyr topology. The approach successfully scales to moderate problem sizes and demonstrates good adaptability to different graph structures, showing RL's potential as a flexible framework for minor embedding.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Learning presents a promising and flexible alternative to traditional heuristics for minor embedding in Quantum Annealing. The PPO-based approach shows good generalization across different problem types and hardware topologies, highlighting RL's potential as a general-purpose framework for addressing the minor embedding challenge in quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving
combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor
embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum
processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with
increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often
developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult
to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by
treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an
agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem
variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor
embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to
embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two
hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent
consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number
of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed
approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to
different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and
general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.

*Ruchira V Bhat,Rahul Bhowmick,Avinash Singh,Krishna Kumar Sabapathy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces two meta-learning algorithms (Meta-VQT and NN-Meta-VQT) for efficient preparation of quantum Gibbs states on NISQ devices, demonstrating significant speedup and improved accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing that is essential for applications in modeling open quantum systems and quantum machine learning. Current methods face efficiency limitations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

Method: The authors develop two meta-learning algorithms based on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework: Meta-VQT (using fully quantum ansatz) and NN-Meta-VQT (using quantum-classical hybrid architecture). Both methods use collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters and serve as warm start initializations for larger systems.

Result: The methods were validated on up to 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and 2-qubit Heisenberg model, showing efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. The algorithms significantly outperformed random initializations and achieved 30-fold runtime speedup over existing VarQITE-based techniques when applied to Quantum Boltzmann Machine training.

Conclusion: The meta-learning approach successfully enables efficient quantum Gibbs state preparation with enhanced training efficiency, improved accuracy, and substantial speedup over existing methods, highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based quantum Boltzmann machines for NISQ devices.

Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum
computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum
systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum
Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem
driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms:
Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT
(NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized
Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT
utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum
classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over
training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We
validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the
2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal
state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our
meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve
as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random
initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring
example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature
crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum
Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms,
achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a
30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum
imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and
practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.

### [259] [Adaptive Bayesian Single-Shot Quantum Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16477)
*Ivana Nikoloska,Ruud Van Sloun,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive Bayesian protocol for quantum sensing that optimizes sensing policies by maximizing information gain, designed for scenarios where single probes are used per time step and supporting multi-agent fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantum sensing optimization requires searching through high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which is classically intractable. Existing approaches use offline frequentist learning criteria rather than adaptive strategies that can dynamically optimize sensing performance in real-time.

Method: The paper proposes a variational quantum sensing framework using Bayesian inference to adaptively optimize sensing policies. The method maximizes active information gain for parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) and measurements, specifically designed for non-asymptotic regimes with single probe deployment per time step.

Result: The methodology successfully enables adaptive optimization of quantum sensing protocols and extends to support fusion of estimates from multiple quantum sensing agents, providing improved performance over traditional offline optimization approaches.

Conclusion: The adaptive Bayesian approach offers a practical solution for quantum sensing optimization that can operate in real-time scenarios with single probe constraints while supporting multi-agent collaboration, advancing beyond classical optimization limitations.

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable
precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and
electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the
limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and
measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires
optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum
sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum
circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum
channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are
typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning
criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian
inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active
information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for
non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step,
and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum
sensing agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical solutions of the Helmholtz equation face significant computational and memory challenges in geophysical applications, requiring a more efficient approach to solve the wave equation fundamentally important for these applications.

Method: The authors develop PICNO (Physics-Informed Convolutional Neural Operator) that takes background wavefield (homogeneous medium) and velocity model as input function spaces to generate scattered wavefield as output. The method integrates PDE constraints directly into the training process to capture underlying physics governing wave phenomena.

Result: PICNO enables high-resolution reasonably accurate predictions even with limited training samples and demonstrates significant improvements over purely data-driven convolutional neural operator (CNO), particularly excelling in predicting high-frequency wavefields.

Conclusion: The physics-informed approach successfully addresses computational challenges in solving the Helmholtz equation, providing superior performance compared to data-driven methods and offering important features for future waveform inversion applications.

Abstract: Solving the wave equation is fundamental for geophysical applications.
However, numerical solutions of the Helmholtz equation face significant
computational and memory challenges. Therefore, we introduce a physics-informed
convolutional neural operator (PICNO) to solve the Helmholtz equation
efficiently. The PICNO takes both the background wavefield corresponding to a
homogeneous medium and the velocity model as input function space, generating
the scattered wavefield as the output function space. Our workflow integrates
PDE constraints directly into the training process, enabling the neural
operator to not only fit the available data but also capture the underlying
physics governing wave phenomena. PICNO allows for high-resolution reasonably
accurate predictions even with limited training samples, and it demonstrates
significant improvements over a purely data-driven convolutional neural
operator (CNO), particularly in predicting high-frequency wavefields. These
features and improvements are important for waveform inversion down the road.

### [262] [Attacking interpretable NLP systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16164)
*Eldor Abdukhamidov,Tamer Abuhmed,Joanna C. S. Santos,Mohammed Abuhamad*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdvChar is a black-box adversarial attack method that targets interpretable NLP systems by making minimal character-level modifications (averaging just 2 characters) to fool classifiers while maintaining semantic meaning and interpretation similarity to build false trust in system transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous adversarial attacks on text models often fail to preserve semantic meaning and similarity. There's a need for attacks that can exploit interpretable NLP systems while maintaining the appearance of trustworthy interpretations, thus exploiting users' trust in system transparency.

Method: AdvChar uses an interpretation-focused scoring approach to identify critical tokens that cause misclassification when modified. It applies simple character-level modifications to minimize differences between original and adversarial text while generating interpretations similar to benign ones. The method targets the most important tokens based on their impact on classifier decisions.

Result: AdvChar was evaluated against seven NLP models and three interpretation models using benchmark datasets. The attack successfully reduced prediction accuracy of deep learning models by modifying only two characters on average in input samples, while maintaining interpretation similarity to benign inputs.

Conclusion: AdvChar demonstrates that interpretable NLP systems can be effectively attacked with minimal, barely noticeable modifications that preserve semantic meaning and interpretation similarity. This highlights a significant vulnerability in interpretable systems where attackers can exploit user trust in system transparency through adversarial examples that appear legitimate.

Abstract: Studies have shown that machine learning systems are vulnerable to
adversarial examples in theory and practice. Where previous attacks have
focused mainly on visual models that exploit the difference between human and
machine perception, text-based models have also fallen victim to these attacks.
However, these attacks often fail to maintain the semantic meaning of the text
and similarity. This paper introduces AdvChar, a black-box attack on
Interpretable Natural Language Processing Systems, designed to mislead the
classifier while keeping the interpretation similar to benign inputs, thus
exploiting trust in system transparency. AdvChar achieves this by making less
noticeable modifications to text input, forcing the deep learning classifier to
make incorrect predictions and preserve the original interpretation. We use an
interpretation-focused scoring approach to determine the most critical tokens
that, when changed, can cause the classifier to misclassify the input. We apply
simple character-level modifications to measure the importance of tokens,
minimizing the difference between the original and new text while generating
adversarial interpretations similar to benign ones. We thoroughly evaluated
AdvChar by testing it against seven NLP models and three interpretation models
using benchmark datasets for the classification task. Our experiments show that
AdvChar can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of current deep
learning models by altering just two characters on average in input samples.

*Rui Guo,Avinash Ayalasomayajula,Henian Li,Jingbo Zhou,Sujan Kumar Saha,Farimah Farahmandi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents SVAgent, an automatic generation framework for SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) that uses requirement decomposition to improve verification efficiency and effectiveness in detecting circuit design vulnerabilities compared to traditional manual SVA development methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SVA development models are inefficient and inadequate for handling the increasing security vulnerabilities in modern complex integrated circuits, especially with the globalization of IC design and continuously upgrading security requirements.

Method: The paper proposes SVAgent, which introduces a requirement decomposition mechanism that transforms complex requirements into structured, fine-grained problem-solving chains that can be solved gradually.

Result: SVAgent effectively suppresses hallucinations and random answers, achieving significantly better accuracy and consistency in SVA generation compared to existing frameworks. The framework was successfully integrated into mainstream IC vulnerability assessment frameworks.

Conclusion: SVAgent demonstrates practical reliability in real engineering design environments and provides a more effective solution for automatic SVA generation, addressing the limitations of traditional manual development approaches in modern IC verification.

Abstract: Verification using SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) is one of the most popular
methods for detecting circuit design vulnerabilities. However, with the
globalization of integrated circuit design and the continuous upgrading of
security requirements, the SVA development model has exposed major limitations.
It is not only inefficient in development, but also unable to effectively deal
with the increasing number of security vulnerabilities in modern complex
integrated circuits. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes an
innovative SVA automatic generation framework SVAgent. SVAgent introduces a
requirement decomposition mechanism to transform the original complex
requirements into a structured, gradually solvable fine-grained problem-solving
chain. Experiments have shown that SVAgent can effectively suppress the
influence of hallucinations and random answers, and the key evaluation
indicators such as the accuracy and consistency of the SVA are significantly
better than existing frameworks. More importantly, we successfully integrated
SVAgent into the most mainstream integrated circuit vulnerability assessment
framework and verified its practicality and reliability in a real engineering
design environment.

### [264] [DREAM: Scalable Red Teaming for Text-to-Image Generative Systems via Distribution Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16329)
*Boheng Li,Junjie Wang,Yiming Li,Zhiyang Hu,Leyi Qi,Jianshuo Dong,Run Wang,Han Qiu,Zhan Qin,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DREAM is a scalable red teaming framework that automatically discovers diverse problematic prompts for text-to-image models by modeling the probabilistic distribution of unsafe prompts rather than optimizing individual prompts, achieving better effectiveness and diversity than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models can still produce harmful content despite safety measures, and current automated red teaming approaches are limited by treating prompt discovery as isolated optimization tasks, reducing their scalability, diversity, and effectiveness in identifying unsafe outputs.

Method: DREAM models the probabilistic distribution of problematic prompts using energy-based model inspiration, enabling optimization over both effectiveness and diversity. The framework includes GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provides stable gradient estimates through non-differentiable T2I pipelines, allowing large-scale sampling after training.

Result: DREAM outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines with notable margins across various T2I models and safety filters, demonstrating superior prompt success rate and diversity in discovering problematic prompts through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DREAM provides a more effective and scalable approach to red teaming text-to-image systems by modeling prompt distributions rather than individual optimization, enabling better assessment and improvement of AI safety before deployment.

Abstract: Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,
text-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing
harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious
concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which
aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs
from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential
external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly
recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before
real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often
treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which
limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to
automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.
Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly
models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic
prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and
diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve
this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw
inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple
and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient
optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long
and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is
validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9
state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I
models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.

*Paul R. B. Houssel,Siamak Layeghy,Priyanka Singh,Marius Portmann*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents eX-NIDS, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) with contextual augmentation to explain why network flows are classified as malicious by Network Intrusion Detection Systems, achieving over 20% performance improvement compared to basic prompt approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) lack interpretability when classifying network flows as malicious, making it difficult for security analysts to understand the reasoning behind detections and potentially leading to trust issues and inefficient incident response.

Method: The framework uses a Prompt Augmenter module that extracts contextual information and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) knowledge from malicious flows detected by NIDS. This enriched data is integrated with LLM input prompts to generate detailed explanations. The approach is evaluated using Llama 3 and GPT-4 models with a novel evaluation method focusing on correctness and consistency of natural language explanations.

Result: The augmented LLM approach demonstrates over 20% performance improvement compared to the Basic-Prompt Explainer baseline. The framework successfully generates accurate and consistent explanations for malicious flow classifications, proving effective as a complementary tool for NIDS interpretability.

Conclusion: eX-NIDS effectively enhances the interpretability of flow-based NIDS by leveraging LLMs with contextual augmentation. The framework serves as a valuable complementary tool that can help security analysts understand malicious flow classifications, with significant performance improvements over basic prompt-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces eX-NIDS, a framework designed to enhance
interpretability in flow-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). In our proposed framework, flows
labelled as malicious by NIDS are initially processed through a module called
the Prompt Augmenter. This module extracts contextual information and Cyber
Threat Intelligence (CTI)-related knowledge from these flows. This enriched,
context-specific data is then integrated with an input prompt for an LLM,
enabling it to generate detailed explanations and interpretations of why the
flow was identified as malicious by NIDS. We compare the generated
interpretations against a Basic-Prompt Explainer baseline, which does not
incorporate any contextual information into the LLM's input prompt. Our
framework is quantitatively evaluated using the Llama 3 and GPT-4 models,
employing a novel evaluation method tailored for natural language explanations,
focusing on their correctness and consistency. The results demonstrate that
augmented LLMs can produce accurate and consistent explanations, serving as
valuable complementary tools in NIDS to explain the classification of malicious
flows. The use of augmented prompts enhances performance by over 20% compared
to the Basic-Prompt Explainer.

### [266] [Depth Gives a False Sense of Privacy: LLM Internal States Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16372)
*Tian Dong,Yan Meng,Shaofeng Li,Guoxing Chen,Zhen Liu,Haojin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes four novel inversion attacks that can reconstruct original inputs from Large Language Models' internal states, challenging the assumption that these states are irreversible and raising significant privacy concerns for collaborative inference systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models integrated into daily routines raise privacy and safety concerns. While collaborative inference and safety auditing techniques expose LLM internal states, these states were previously assumed to be irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and abstract representations in deep layers. The authors challenge this assumption to highlight potential privacy vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors develop four inversion attacks: (1) two white-box optimization-based attacks for low-depth and high-depth internal states using a two-phase inversion process to avoid local minima, (2) a black-box attack leveraging transferability between source and derived LLMs, and (3) a generation-based attack treating inversion as a translation task using an inversion model to reconstruct inputs.

Result: Extensive evaluation on short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets across 6 LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt achieved nearly perfect inversion with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of the Llama-3 model. Four practical defenses were evaluated but found insufficient to perfectly prevent internal state inversion.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that LLM internal states are not irreversible as previously assumed, revealing significant privacy vulnerabilities in collaborative inference systems. The proposed inversion attacks achieve high semantic similarity and token matching rates, and existing defenses are inadequate, highlighting the need for better mitigation strategies in future system designs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines,
yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research
proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to
ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner
neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which
are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization
challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this
work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that
significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of
inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box
optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These
attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,
through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack
under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability
between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a
generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing
an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and
long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs
validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token
long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1
token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate
four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion
and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DID methods struggle with high-dimensional confounding variables in observational panel data, while machine learning approaches lack causal structure interpretability. There's a need for a method that can handle complex, high-dimensional data while preserving the causal identification structure of DID.

Method: S-DIDML integrates structural identification with high-dimensional estimation by: (1) employing structured residual orthogonalization techniques (Neyman orthogonality + cross-fitting) to retain group-time treatment effect identification while handling high-dimensional covariates, (2) designing a dynamic heterogeneity estimation module combining causal forests and semi-parametric models to capture spatiotemporal effects, and (3) establishing a modular framework with standardized Stata implementation.

Result: The framework successfully shifts causal inference from method stacking to architecture integration, enabling precise identification of policy-sensitive groups and optimization of resource allocation. It provides replicable evaluation tools and decision optimization references for complex intervention scenarios.

Conclusion: S-DIDML enriches methodological research on DID and DDML innovations by providing a comprehensive framework that maintains causal interpretability while handling high-dimensional data. The method offers practical applications for complex policy evaluations such as digital transformation policies and environmental regulations, advancing causal inference methodology in social sciences.

Abstract: Causal inference in observational panel data has become a central concern in

stacking to architecture integration.This advancement enables social sciences
to precisely identify policy-sensitive groups and optimize resource
allocation.The framework provides replicable evaluation tools, decision
optimization references,and methodological paradigms for complex intervention

TL;DR: A hybrid data-driven approach combining conditional diffusion models with exit prediction neural networks to simulate stochastic differential equations in bounded domains, addressing particle exit phenomena that existing ML methods cannot handle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods for learning SDEs fail to accurately capture particle exit dynamics in bounded domains, which is crucial for simulating stochastic processes where particles can exit the domain boundaries.

Method: A unified hybrid approach with two components: (1) a neural network that learns exit probabilities using binary cross-entropy loss with convergence guarantees, and (2) a training-free diffusion model that generates state transitions for non-exiting particles using closed-form score functions, integrated through a probabilistic sampling algorithm.

Result: The approach was validated on three test cases: a one-dimensional theoretical verification problem, a two-dimensional advection-diffusion problem in bounded domains, and a three-dimensional magnetically confined fusion plasma problem, demonstrating effective performance across different dimensionalities and applications.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method successfully addresses the computational challenges of simulating SDEs in bounded domains by accurately modeling both interior stochastic dynamics and boundary exit phenomena, providing a robust solution for applications requiring precise particle exit modeling.

Abstract: Simulating stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in bounded domains,
presents significant computational challenges due to particle exit phenomena,
which requires accurate modeling of interior stochastic dynamics and boundary
interactions. Despite the success of machine learning-based methods in learning
SDEs, existing learning methods are not applicable to SDEs in bounded domains
because they cannot accurately capture the particle exit dynamics. We present a
unified hybrid data-driven approach that combines a conditional diffusion model
with an exit prediction neural network to capture both interior stochastic
dynamics and boundary exit phenomena. Our ML model consists of two major
components: a neural network that learns exit probabilities using binary
cross-entropy loss with rigorous convergence guarantees, and a training-free
diffusion model that generates state transitions for non-exiting particles
using closed-form score functions. The two components are integrated through a
probabilistic sampling algorithm that determines particle exit at each time
step and generates appropriate state transitions. The performance of the
proposed approach is demonstrated via three test cases: a one-dimensional
simplified problem for theoretical verification, a two-dimensional
advection-diffusion problem in a bounded domain, and a three-dimensional
problem of interest to magnetically confined fusion plasmas.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel algorithm for off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits that constructs probably approximately correct (PAC) prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees, building upon conformal prediction frameworks to provide reliable performance estimates for target policies using data from different behavior policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing off-policy evaluation methods in contextual bandits lack reliable uncertainty quantification, especially for safety-critical applications. While conformal prediction methods provide marginal coverage guarantees, there's a need for stronger conditional coverage guarantees given specific offline datasets to ensure more robust policy evaluation.

Method: The authors develop a PAC-valid conformal prediction framework that constructs probably approximately correct prediction intervals for off-policy evaluation. The method strengthens theoretical guarantees by establishing PAC-type bounds on coverage, providing both finite-sample and asymptotic analysis of the proposed algorithm.

Result: The proposed method achieves coverage conditional on given offline datasets with PAC-type theoretical guarantees. Both finite-sample and asymptotic properties are analyzed, and empirical simulations demonstrate competitive performance compared to existing off-policy evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends conformal prediction to off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits with stronger theoretical coverage guarantees. The PAC-valid framework provides reliable prediction intervals that are particularly valuable for safety-critical applications where robust uncertainty quantification is essential.

Abstract: This paper investigates off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits, aiming
to quantify the performance of a target policy using data collected under a
different and potentially unknown behavior policy. Recently, methods based on
conformal prediction have been developed to construct reliable prediction
intervals that guarantee marginal coverage in finite samples, making them
particularly suited for safety-critical applications. To further achieve
coverage conditional on a given offline data set, we propose a novel algorithm
that constructs probably approximately correct prediction intervals. Our method
builds upon a PAC-valid conformal prediction framework, and we strengthen its
theoretical guarantees by establishing PAC-type bounds on coverage. We analyze
both finite-sample and asymptotic properties of the proposed method, and
compare its empirical performance with existing methods in simulations.

### [270] [Estimating Treatment Effects with Independent Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16467)
*Patrik Reizinger,Lester Mackey,Wieland Brendel,Rahul Krishnan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper connects causal inference and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) by showing that linear ICA can be used to estimate treatment effects in partially linear regression models, even with Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Both causal inference and identifiability theory aim to achieve accurate and sample-efficient parameter estimation, but have developed independently. The authors noticed that both fields rely on non-Gaussianity assumptions - causal inference for treatment effect estimation consistency and ICA for latent factor identification - suggesting a potential connection worth exploring.

Method: The authors theoretically and empirically investigate the connection between causal inference and ICA in the partially linear regression (PLR) setting. They apply linear ICA techniques to estimate multiple treatment effects, leveraging the non-Gaussianity assumption that benefits both fields.

Result: Linear ICA can accurately estimate multiple treatment effects in PLR models, even when dealing with Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisance terms. This demonstrates that ICA methods can be successfully adapted for causal effect estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a novel theoretical and practical bridge between causal inference and ICA, showing that techniques from identifiability theory can enhance causal effect estimation. This cross-pollination between fields opens new avenues for improving treatment effect estimation methods.

Abstract: The field of causal inference has developed a variety of methods to
accurately estimate treatment effects in the presence of nuisance. Meanwhile,
the field of identifiability theory has developed methods like Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) to identify latent sources and mixing weights from
data. While these two research communities have developed largely
independently, they aim to achieve similar goals: the accurate and
sample-efficient estimation of model parameters. In the partially linear
regression (PLR) setting, Mackey et al. (2018) recently found that estimation
consistency can be improved with non-Gaussian treatment noise. Non-Gaussianity
is also a crucial assumption for identifying latent factors in ICA. We provide
the first theoretical and empirical insights into this connection, showing that
ICA can be used for causal effect estimation in the PLR model. Surprisingly, we
find that linear ICA can accurately estimate multiple treatment effects even in
the presence of Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisance.

### [271] [Structural Effect and Spectral Enhancement of High-Dimensional Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16682)
*Yonghan Zhang,Zhangni Pu,Lu Yan,Jiang Hu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes SEDA (Spectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis), an improved version of regularized linear discriminant analysis that optimizes data structure by adjusting eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, achieving better classification accuracy in high-dimensional scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) shows inconsistent performance in high-dimensional scenarios, and existing theoretical analyses lack clear insight into how data structure affects classification performance, necessitating better understanding and improvement of RLDA methods.

Method: The authors derive non-asymptotic approximation of misclassification rate to analyze structural effects, then propose SEDA algorithm that optimizes data structure by adjusting spiked eigenvalues of population covariance matrix, along with developing new theoretical results on eigenvectors in random matrix theory for asymptotic approximation.

Result: SEDA achieves higher classification accuracy and better dimensionality reduction compared to existing LDA methods, as demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, with bias correction algorithm and parameter selection strategy successfully derived.

Conclusion: The proposed SEDA algorithm successfully addresses the limitations of RLDA in high-dimensional settings by incorporating spectral enhancement through eigenvalue adjustment, providing both theoretical foundation and practical improvements for linear discriminant analysis applications.

Abstract: Regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) is a widely used tool for
classification and dimensionality reduction, but its performance in
high-dimensional scenarios is inconsistent. Existing theoretical analyses of
RLDA often lack clear insight into how data structure affects classification
performance. To address this issue, we derive a non-asymptotic approximation of
the misclassification rate and thus analyze the structural effect and
structural adjustment strategies of RLDA. Based on this, we propose the
Spectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis (SEDA) algorithm, which optimizes the
data structure by adjusting the spiked eigenvalues of the population covariance
matrix. By developing a new theoretical result on eigenvectors in random matrix
theory, we derive an asymptotic approximation on the misclassification rate of
SEDA. The bias correction algorithm and parameter selection strategy are then
obtained. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that SEDA achieves
higher classification accuracy and dimensionality reduction compared to
existing LDA methods.

### [272] ["Just a strange pic": Evaluating 'safety' in GenAI Image safety annotation tasks from diverse annotators' perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16033)
*Ding Wang,Mark Díaz,Charvi Rastogi,Aida Davani,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran,Pushkar Mishra,Roma Patel,Alicia Parrish,Zoe Ashwood,Michela Paganini,Tian Huey Teh,Verena Rieser,Lora Aroyo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how human annotators evaluate safety in AI-generated images, finding that their judgments involve complex moral, emotional, and contextual reasoning that extends beyond standard safety taxonomies and is influenced by annotation guidelines and personal experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety evaluation relies on predefined taxonomies but real-world safety judgments are more complex, involving personal, social, and cultural perceptions of harm. There's a need to understand how annotators actually reason about safety in AI-generated content beyond structured categories.

Method: Qualitative analysis of 5,372 open-ended comments from annotators evaluating AI-generated images. The researchers examined the reasoning patterns, moral judgments, and factors that influence how annotators assess safety and potential harm.

Result: Annotators consistently use moral, emotional, and contextual reasoning beyond safety categories. They consider harm to others more than themselves, draw on lived experience and sociocultural awareness. Task structure and guidelines significantly shape interpretations. Annotators cite technical factors like image quality and prompt-output mismatches as harm contributors, which are overlooked in standard frameworks.

Conclusion: Existing safety pipelines miss critical forms of human reasoning about AI-generated content. The authors advocate for evaluation designs that scaffold moral reflection, differentiate harm types, and accommodate subjective, context-sensitive interpretations rather than relying solely on predefined taxonomies.

Abstract: Understanding what constitutes safety in AI-generated content is complex.
While developers often rely on predefined taxonomies, real-world safety
judgments also involve personal, social, and cultural perceptions of harm. This
paper examines how annotators evaluate the safety of AI-generated images,
focusing on the qualitative reasoning behind their judgments. Analyzing 5,372
open-ended comments, we find that annotators consistently invoke moral,
emotional, and contextual reasoning that extends beyond structured safety
categories. Many reflect on potential harm to others more than to themselves,
grounding their judgments in lived experience, collective risk, and
sociocultural awareness. Beyond individual perceptions, we also find that the
structure of the task itself -- including annotation guidelines -- shapes how
annotators interpret and express harm. Guidelines influence not only which
images are flagged, but also the moral judgment behind the justifications.
Annotators frequently cite factors such as image quality, visual distortion,
and mismatches between prompt and output as contributing to perceived harm
dimensions, which are often overlooked in standard evaluation frameworks. Our
findings reveal that existing safety pipelines miss critical forms of reasoning
that annotators bring to the task. We argue for evaluation designs that
scaffold moral reflection, differentiate types of harm, and make space for
subjective, context-sensitive interpretations of AI-generated content.

*Katelyn Morrison,Arpit Mathur,Aidan Bradshaw,Tom Wartmann,Steven Lundi,Afrooz Zandifar,Weichang Dai,Kayhan Batmanghelich,Motahhare Eslami,Adam Perer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper takes a human-centered approach to evaluate a text-to-CT scan generative AI model by involving medical professionals (students, trainees, and radiologists) to understand its potential benefits, risks, and challenges in medical education and practice, rather than developing the technology without stakeholder input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image generative AI models for medical imagery are being developed without involving medical professionals as stakeholders, risking the creation of models that may be useless or harmful. There's a need to understand how medical professionals would actually benefit from and use such technology in practice.

Method: The researchers adopted a human-centered approach by conducting exploratory model prompting activities with medical students, radiology trainees, and radiologists to evaluate a novel text-to-CT scan generative AI model. They gathered stakeholder perspectives on the model's potential role across medical education, training, and practice.

Result: The study uncovered perspectives from medical professionals on how text-to-CT scan GenAI could be used in medical education, training, and practice. It also surfaced technical challenges and domain-specific risks associated with generating synthetic medical images through stakeholder engagement.

Conclusion: The paper reflects on the implications of medical text-to-image GenAI and demonstrates the importance of involving stakeholders in responsible model development. The human-centered approach revealed both opportunities and risks that would have been missed without medical professional input.

Abstract: As text-to-image generative models rapidly improve, AI researchers are making
significant advances in developing domain-specific models capable of generating
complex medical imagery from text prompts. Despite this, these technical
advancements have overlooked whether and how medical professionals would
benefit from and use text-to-image generative AI (GenAI) in practice. By
developing domain-specific GenAI without involving stakeholders, we risk the
potential of building models that are either not useful or even more harmful
than helpful. In this paper, we adopt a human-centered approach to responsible
model development by involving stakeholders in evaluating and reflecting on the
promises, risks, and challenges of a novel text-to-CT Scan GenAI model. Through
exploratory model prompting activities, we uncover the perspectives of medical
students, radiology trainees, and radiologists on the role that text-to-CT Scan
GenAI can play across medical education, training, and practice. This
human-centered approach additionally enabled us to surface technical challenges
and domain-specific risks of generating synthetic medical images. We conclude
by reflecting on the implications of medical text-to-image GenAI.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study evaluates user acceptance of a web-based XR training system for journalists that uses virtual avatars, extending the Almere model to include new factors like dependability and security, and finds insights for improving XR agent technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to provide safe, accessible training for journalists in sensitive or dangerous scenarios without requiring specialized equipment, while understanding social acceptance factors for XR agent technology in professional contexts.

Method: Controlled experiment using an extended Almere model that includes traditional factors (perceived ease of use, usefulness) plus new attributes (dependability, security), with quantitative and qualitative data collection through questionnaires in real-world settings.

Result: The study successfully collected user perception data on XR agent acceptance and identified specific areas for improvement in XR systems, contributing to understanding of social acceptance factors for XR technology in professional training contexts.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into user acceptance of XR agent solutions for professional training, demonstrates the effectiveness of extending existing acceptance models for XR contexts, and identifies improvement areas for future XR system development.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the findings of a user study that evaluated the
social acceptance of eXtended Reality (XR) agent technology, focusing on a
remotely accessible, web-based XR training system developed for journalists.
This system involves user interaction with a virtual avatar, enabled by a
modular toolkit. The interactions are designed to provide tailored training for
journalists in digital-remote settings, especially for sensitive or dangerous
scenarios, without requiring specialized end-user equipment like headsets. Our
research adapts and extends the Almere model, representing social acceptance
through existing attributes such as perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness, along with added ones like dependability and security in the
user-agent interaction. The XR agent was tested through a controlled experiment
in a real-world setting, with data collected on users' perceptions. Our
findings, based on quantitative and qualitative measurements involving
questionnaires, contribute to the understanding of user perceptions and
acceptance of XR agent solutions within a specific social context, while also
identifying areas for the improvement of XR systems.

TL;DR: This paper conducts a multivocal literature review examining how AI can enhance user experience (UX) in Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) software, revealing significant gaps between academic research and industry implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) faces challenges in user experience that limit efficiency and accessibility for simulation experts. While AI shows potential to enhance CAE processes, research integrating AI with CAE from a UX perspective remains fragmented, creating a need for comprehensive analysis of this intersection.

Method: The authors conducted a multivocal literature review (MLR) to examine how AI enhances UX in CAE software, analyzing both academic research and industry implementations to map the current state and identify gaps between theoretical research and practical applications.

Result: The analysis revealed significant gaps between academic explorations and industry applications. Industry is actively implementing LLMs, adaptive UIs, and recommender systems, while academic research primarily focuses on technical capabilities without UX validation.

*Laura Moradbakhti,Dorian Peters,Jennifer K. Quint,Björn Schuller,Darren Cook,Rafael A. Calvo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A survey of 1,257 asthma patients found that 53% are interested in using chatbots for health support, with WhatsApp being the preferred platform. Patients who perceive their asthma as more serious and have lower self-management confidence are most likely to engage with chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The UK has the highest asthma-related deaths in Europe with only 30% of patients accessing basic care. There is a need for alternative approaches to reach asthma patients and provide health education, self-management support, and care bridges through automated conversational agents (chatbots).

Method: A patient survey (N=1,257) was conducted by a multidisciplinary team of asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers to identify optimal factors for chatbot efficacy, value, and engagement in asthma care.

Result: 53% of adults with asthma expressed interest in using chatbots. Patients most likely to engage are those who believe their asthma is more serious and have lower self-management confidence. Patients showed enthusiasm for 24/7 access, personalization, and WhatsApp as the preferred platform. Main barriers include security/privacy concerns and skepticism about technological capabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides 7 recommendations for developers to optimize chatbot-based health support effectiveness. The findings suggest significant potential for chatbot adoption in asthma care, particularly among patients with greater perceived disease severity and self-management challenges, with WhatsApp being the optimal delivery platform.

Abstract: Asthma-related deaths in the UK are the highest in Europe, and only 30% of
patients access basic care. There is a need for alternative approaches to
reaching people with asthma in order to provide health education,
self-management support and bridges to care. Automated conversational agents
(specifically, mobile chatbots) present opportunities for providing alternative
and individually tailored access to health education, self-management support
and risk self-assessment. But would patients engage with a chatbot, and what
factors influence engagement? We present results from a patient survey (N=1257)
devised by a team of asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers,
conducted to identify optimal factors for efficacy, value and engagement for a
chatbot. Results indicate that most adults with asthma (53%) are interested in
using a chatbot and the patients most likely to do so are those who believe
their asthma is more serious and who are less confident about self-management.
Results also indicate enthusiasm for 24/7 access, personalisation, and for
WhatsApp as the preferred access method (compared to app, voice assistant, SMS
or website). Obstacles to uptake include security/privacy concerns and
skepticism of technological capabilities. We present detailed findings and
consolidate these into 7 recommendations for developers for optimising efficacy
of chatbot-based health support.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlgoTune, a benchmark for evaluating language models' ability to design and implement efficient algorithms for computationally challenging problems, finding that while models achieve modest speedups, they lack true algorithmic innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of language models focus on tasks humans have already solved, lacking assessment of models' ability to create novel algorithmic solutions for open-ended computational problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics.

Method: The authors created AlgoTune benchmark with 155 coding tasks from domain experts and a validation framework for timing LM-synthesized code against reference implementations from popular packages like SciPy and sk-learn. They also developed AlgoTuner, a baseline LM agent, to evaluate frontier models.

Result: AlgoTuner achieved an average 1.72x speedup compared to reference solvers using established libraries, but current models failed to discover genuine algorithmic innovations, instead relying on surface-level optimizations.

Conclusion: While language models can achieve performance improvements through optimization, they currently lack the capability for creative algorithmic problem-solving and innovation beyond existing human solutions, highlighting the need for further development in this area.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus
far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved,
including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al.,
2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement
algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that
efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science,
physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 155 coding tasks
collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing
LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations
from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent,
AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models.
AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers,
which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that
current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring
surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of
LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human
performance.

### [278] [Dr. Boot: Bootstrapping Program Synthesis Language Models to Perform Repairing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15889)
*Noah van der Vleuten*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bootstrapping algorithm for program synthesis that teaches models code repair, addressing limitations in current datasets and model training approaches that don't align with human iterative programming practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current program synthesis language models face two key issues: (1) limited size and quality of training datasets (MBPP, APPS) despite being extremely data hungry, and (2) misaligned synthesis process compared to humans who iteratively develop code with compiler feedback, while models produce code in one go.

Method: The authors propose a bootstrapping algorithm for program synthesis that incorporates code repair capabilities. This approach teaches models how to iteratively fix code, better mimicking human programming behavior compared to traditional one-shot generation methods.

Result: Bootstrapping consistently outperforms regular fine-tuning. The bootstrapped model achieves comparable performance to fine-tuned models that are 68% larger. Bootstrapping with repairing improves non-repairing performance compared to regular bootstrapping, though repairing during inference may be inferior to simply sampling more solutions.

Conclusion: The bootstrapping approach with repair capabilities offers a promising direction for improving program synthesis models efficiency and performance. However, the authors identify significant issues with example test cases in the APPS dataset training portion that affect repairing and reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Language models for program synthesis are usually trained and evaluated on
programming competition datasets (MBPP, APPS). However, these datasets are
limited in size and quality, while these language models are extremely data
hungry. Additionally, the language models have a misaligned program synthesis
process compared to humans. While humans iteratively develop code with the help
of a compiler, most program synthesis models currently produce code in one go.
To solve these issues, we introduce a bootstrapping algorithm for program
synthesis, that supports teaching models how to repair. We show that
bootstrapping consistently outperforms regular fine-tuning. Compared to other
work, our bootstrapped model performs on par with fine-tuned models that are
68\% larger. Notably, bootstrapping with repairing also improves non-repairing
performance compared to regular bootstrapping during inference. However, on our
models, repairing during inference is likely inferior to simply sampling the
same number of solutions. Furthermore, we find that there are issues with the
example test cases in the training portion of the APPS dataset that are
valuable to the community, as many repairing and reinforcement learning methods
rely on them.

TL;DR: The paper introduces APCE (AI-Powered Commit Explorer), a tool that helps developers and researchers generate, evaluate, and study LLM-generated commit messages for version control systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writing high-quality commit messages is often neglected in practice, yet they provide valuable information about code changes. LLM-generated commit messages have emerged as a solution, but there's a need for tools to support their use and evaluation.

Method: The authors developed APCE, a tool that allows users to store different LLM prompts, provides an evaluation prompt to enhance commit messages, and offers mechanisms for both automated and human evaluation of LLM-generated commit messages.

Result: APCE successfully provides a comprehensive platform for generating, storing, and evaluating LLM-generated commit messages, with features for prompt management and dual evaluation approaches (automated and human).

Conclusion: APCE offers a practical solution for developers and researchers to leverage LLMs for commit message generation while providing robust evaluation capabilities to ensure quality and effectiveness of the generated messages.

Abstract: Commit messages in a version control system provide valuable information for
developers regarding code changes in software systems. Commit messages can be
the only source of information left for future developers describing what was
changed and why. However, writing high-quality commit messages is often
neglected in practice. Large Language Model (LLM) generated commit messages
have emerged as a way to mitigate this issue. We introduce the AI-Powered
Commit Explorer (APCE), a tool to support developers and researchers in the use
and study of LLM-generated commit messages. APCE gives researchers the option
to store different prompts for LLMs and provides an additional evaluation
prompt that can further enhance the commit message provided by LLMs. APCE also
provides researchers with a straightforward mechanism for automated and human

### [280] [LOCOFY Large Design Models -- Design to code conversion solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16208)
*Sohaib Muhammad,Ashwati Vipin,Karan Shetti,Honey Mittal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Large Design Models (LDMs), a specialized paradigm for converting design mockups to code that outperforms general Large Language Models by incorporating design-specific training, optimized data pipelines, and automated component extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Language Models and Multimodal LLMs face significant challenges in design-to-code conversion including interpretability issues, scalability problems, high resource requirements, and poor repeatability, necessitating a specialized approach tailored for design understanding and code generation.

Method: The authors developed LDMs with a comprehensive training pipeline including: 1) Design Optimiser using proprietary ground truth data to fix sub-optimal designs, 2) Tagging and feature detection with pre-trained and fine-tuned models for accurate UI element classification, and 3) Auto Components for extracting reusable UI structures. They also created an inference pipeline for processing real-world designs with interpretable code generation instructions.

Result: LDMs demonstrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments showed superior performance over LLMs in node positioning accuracy, responsiveness, and reproducibility. The custom tagging and feature detection model achieved high precision and consistency in UI element identification across diverse test designs.

Conclusion: LDMs provide a reliable and superior solution for design understanding and code generation, offering better accuracy, consistency, and production-ready code quality compared to general-purpose language models, making them highly suitable for practical design-to-code applications.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language
Models (LLMs), numerous challenges related to interpretability, scalability,
resource requirements and repeatability remain, related to their application in
the design-to-code space. To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models
(LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless
conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference
pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture
modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design
Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses
sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and
fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI
elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable
components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while
enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but
key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline
processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions
for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models
illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a
novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior
performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning,
responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and
feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in
identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our
proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs
that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable
production-ready code.

*Fangjian Lei,Mariam El Mezouar,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores RAG pipeline designs for improving LLM responses to developer questions by constructing a 3M+ Stack Overflow corpus and evaluating 7 different RAG pipelines across 63 variants, finding that HyDE with full-answer context performs best and consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across 4 open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models show promise for code-related questions but suffer from unreliability and hallucinations. While RAG has been proposed to address this issue, designing effective RAG pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design choices and the need to handle both similar historical questions and novel questions without close matches.

Method: The authors construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java and Python Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines with 63 variants, implement automatic similarity threshold lowering for novel questions, and test the optimal pipeline (HyDE with full-answer context) on 4 open-source LLMs using LLM-as-a-judge evaluation.

Result: The HyDE with full-answer context RAG pipeline performs best for retrieving and answering Stack Overflow questions. The optimal RAG pipeline consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across all tested models, achieving higher scores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail. The approach successfully handles both previously seen questions and novel questions without close matches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that well-designed RAG pipelines can robustly enhance answer quality for developer queries across different LLMs. The optimal pipeline combining HyDE with full-answer context provides a reliable solution for improving LLM responses to both historical and novel developer questions, making LLMs more trustworthy for code-related assistance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting developers with
code-related questions; however, LLMs carry the risk of generating unreliable
answers. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been
proposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,
designing effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design
choices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java
and Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore
various RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their
effectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,
we (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants
to answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new
questions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the
similarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding
partially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find
that implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding
(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering
similarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG

### [282] [Rethinking LLM-Based RTL Code Optimization Via Timing Logic Metamorphosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16808)
*Zhihao Xu,Bixin Li,Lulu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods for optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, particularly focusing on complex timing logic, and finds that while LLMs excel at logic operations optimization, they struggle with timing-related optimizations compared to traditional compiler-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RTL code optimization relies on manual tuning and heuristics which are time-consuming and error-prone. While recent studies proposed using LLMs for RTL optimization, there lacks thorough evaluation of LLM effectiveness specifically for RTL code with complex timing logic, creating a research gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: The authors propose a new benchmark comprising four subsets for RTL optimization evaluation and introduce a metamorphosis-based method to systematically evaluate LLM-based RTL optimization methods. The key insight is that optimization effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more complex code.

Result: Through intensive experiments, the study found that: (1) LLM-based methods effectively optimize logic operations and outperform compiler-based methods in this area, and (2) LLM-based methods do not perform better than compiler-based methods on complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow and clock domain optimization, due to LLMs' challenges in understanding timing logic in RTL code.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLMs show promise for RTL logic optimization but have significant limitations in handling complex timing logic. The authors provide insights for future research directions in leveraging LLMs for RTL code optimization, highlighting the need to address LLMs' understanding of timing semantics in hardware description languages.

Abstract: Register Transfer Level(RTL) code optimization is crucial for achieving high
performance and low power consumption in digital circuit design. However,
traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics,
which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to
leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs
can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions,
potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches
have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization
methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we
conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of
LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex
timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL
optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a
specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on
metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL
code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization
effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more
complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.
(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic
operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL
optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods
on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow
optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the
challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these
findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL
code optimization.

*Gautam Kishore Shahi,Scot A. Hale*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study analyzes 580 claims from WhatsApp tiplines during India's 2021 assembly elections, examining misinformation patterns across English, Hindi, and Telugu languages, finding similarities in claims across languages and providing insights into fact-checking response times and user behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how WhatsApp tiplines combat misinformation during elections by analyzing user behavior, claim patterns, and fact-checker response effectiveness across different languages and organizations during a critical political period.

Method: Mixed-method approach analyzing 580 unique claims from 451 users across three languages (English, Hindi, Telugu). Methods include content categorization into election/COVID-19/others, frequent word analysis, neural sentence embedding clustering, user overlap investigation, and response time measurement.

Result: Claims show similarities across languages with some multilingual user submissions to same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers typically require a couple of days to debunk claims. No users submit to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating distinct audiences for each organization. Variations in claim types observed across different languages.

Conclusion: WhatsApp tiplines effectively facilitate fact-checking across languages during elections, with each organization maintaining unique user bases. The study provides practical recommendations for election-period tipline usage while emphasizing ethical considerations for user information handling.

Abstract: WhatsApp tiplines, first launched in 2019 to combat misinformation, enable
users to interact with fact-checkers to verify misleading content. This study
analyzes 580 unique claims (tips) from 451 users, covering both high-resource
languages (English, Hindi) and a low-resource language (Telugu) during the 2021
Indian assembly elections using a mixed-method approach. We categorize the
claims into three categories, election, COVID-19, and others, and observe
variations across languages. We compare content similarity through frequent
word analysis and clustering of neural sentence embeddings. We also investigate
user overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations. We measure the
average time required to debunk claims and inform tipline users. Results reveal
similarities in claims across languages, with some users submitting tips in
multiple languages to the same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers generally require a
couple of days to debunk a new claim and share the results with users. Notably,
no user submits claims to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that
each organization maintains a unique audience. We provide practical
recommendations for using tiplines during elections with ethical consideration
of users' information.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExpTeach is a framework that grounds vision-language models to physical robots by building a self-generated memory of real-world experiences, using reflection and retrieval-augmented generation to improve robotic task performance from 36% to 84% success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models trained on internet data face challenges when grounding to diverse real-world robots for autonomous planning, requiring a framework to bridge this gap between internet-trained models and physical robot environments.

Method: ExpTeach uses a closed-loop framework where VLMs autonomously plan actions, verify outcomes, reflect on failures, and adapt behaviors. The system builds a self-generated memory from these experiences and uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for future task guidance, enhanced with an on-demand image annotation module for spatial understanding.

Result: Reflection improved success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks, with emergence of intelligent object interactions including creative tool use. Long-term memory grounding boosted single-trial success rates from 22% to 80% across 12 real-world scenarios (including 8 unseen ones).

Conclusion: ExpTeach effectively grounds VLMs to physical robots through self-generated experience memory and reflection, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rates and generalizability across diverse real-world robotic scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable
autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet
data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents
ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a
self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM
autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts
robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this
process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of
learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with
an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection
improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and
observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative
tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight
unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial
success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of ExpTeach.

### [285] [Compositional Coordination for Multi-Robot Teams with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16068)
*Zhehui Huang,Guangyao Shi,Yuwei Wu,Vijay Kumar,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAN2CB is a framework that uses large language models to automatically convert natural language mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot coordination, eliminating the need for manual expert translation and making robot coordination accessible to non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-robot coordination requires a labor-intensive, expert-driven pipeline where domain experts manually translate natural language mission descriptions into mathematical formulations, algorithms, and code. This process is inaccessible to non-experts and inflexible to changes in mission requirements.

Method: LAN2CB leverages large language models with two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation that parses missions into task graphs with dependencies, and (2) Code Generation that uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to generate deployable robot control code. The framework also includes a dataset of natural language mission specifications for development and benchmarking.

Result: Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination directly from natural language descriptions, significantly reducing manual engineering requirements while supporting generalization across different mission types.

Conclusion: LAN2CB successfully streamlines and generalizes the multi-robot coordination pipeline by automatically converting natural language to executable code, making multi-robot systems more accessible to non-experts and more adaptable to changing mission requirements.

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination has traditionally relied on a task-specific and
expert-driven pipeline, where natural language mission descriptions are
manually translated by domain experts into mathematical formulation, algorithm
design, and executable code. This conventional process is labor-intensive,
inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements.
Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework
that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the
multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB directly converts natural language
mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems
through two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation,
which parses the mission into a task graph with dependencies, and (2) Code
Generation, which uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to
generate deployable robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of
natural language mission specifications to support development and
benchmarking. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings
show that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination from
natural language, significantly reducing the need for manual engineering while
supporting generalization across mission types. Website:

### [286] [Equivariant Goal Conditioned Contrastive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16139)
*Arsh Tangri,Nichols Crawford Taylor,Haojie Huang,Robert Platt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Equivariant Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (ECRL) that incorporates rotation symmetries into contrastive RL to improve sample efficiency and spatial generalization in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Contrastive RL learns representations by pulling together state-action pairs with future states, but doesn't leverage inherent symmetries in manipulation tasks. The authors want to improve sample efficiency and spatial generalization by incorporating equivariant constraints that respect rotation symmetries in goal-conditioned robotic manipulation.

Method: The authors formally define Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs to characterize rotation-symmetric manipulation tasks. They introduce ECRL with a rotation-invariant critic representation paired with a rotation-equivariant actor, structuring the latent space using equivariant constraints while maintaining the contrastive learning framework.

Result: ECRL consistently outperforms strong baselines across simulated tasks in both state-based and image-based settings. The method demonstrates improved sample efficiency and spatial generalization. The approach also extends successfully to offline RL settings across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating equivariant constraints into contrastive RL effectively leverages symmetries in robotic manipulation tasks, leading to better sample efficiency and generalization. The formal framework of Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs provides a principled way to structure representations, and the method shows robust performance across different settings including offline RL.

Abstract: Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (CRL) provides a promising framework for
extracting useful structured representations from unlabeled interactions. By
pulling together state-action pairs and their corresponding future states,
while pushing apart negative pairs, CRL enables learning nontrivial policies
without manually designed rewards. In this work, we propose Equivariant CRL
(ECRL), which further structures the latent space using equivariant
constraints. By leveraging inherent symmetries in goal-conditioned manipulation
tasks, our method improves both sample efficiency and spatial generalization.
Specifically, we formally define Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs to
characterize rotation-symmetric robotic manipulation tasks, and build on this
by introducing a novel rotation-invariant critic representation paired with a
rotation-equivariant actor for Contrastive RL. Our approach consistently
outperforms strong baselines across a range of simulated tasks in both
state-based and image-based settings. Finally, we extend our method to the
offline RL setting, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple tasks.

### [287] [Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16124)
*Dakota Sullivan,Shirley Zhang,Jennica Li,Heather Kirkorian,Bilge Mutlu,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study evaluates privacy awareness of large language models (LLMs) in household social robots by comparing human privacy preferences with LLM responses across privacy scenarios, finding low agreement and exploring potential improvements through different prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing use of LLMs in social robots that collect sensitive personal data in home environments, creating a critical need to evaluate whether these models can appropriately handle privacy-sensitive scenarios while maintaining utility for human-robot interaction.

Method: The researchers created privacy-relevant scenarios using Contextual Integrity framework, surveyed 450 users about their privacy preferences for in-home social robot behaviors, tested 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on the same scenarios, and implemented four additional prompting strategies to assess LLM privacy awareness capabilities.

Result: The study found low agreement between human privacy preferences and LLM responses in household social robot scenarios. The researchers also evaluated different prompting strategies to improve LLM privacy awareness and examined how users' privacy orientations affect their behavioral choices.

Conclusion: Current out-of-the-box LLMs demonstrate limited privacy awareness in household social robot contexts, highlighting the need for better AI privacy controllers and more sophisticated approaches to align LLM behavior with human privacy expectations in human-robot interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following
human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal
cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have
previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user
interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new
opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot
interaction. To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to
collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a
result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within
home environments. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks,
evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we
aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the
context of household social robots. In this study, we present a set of
privacy-relevant scenarios crafted through the lens of Contextual Integrity
(CI). We first survey users' privacy preferences regarding in-home social robot
behaviors and then examine how their privacy orientation affects their choices
of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provide the same set of scenarios and
questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and find that the agreement between
humans and LLMs is low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as a
potential privacy controller, we implement four additional prompting strategies
and compare their results. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential
of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.

*Xuying Huang,Sicong Pan,Olga Zatsarynna,Juergen Gall,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a joint-learning method for privacy-preserving robot navigation that performs semantic segmentation on ultra-low-resolution images to protect visual privacy while maintaining navigation effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User privacy in mobile robotics is a critical concern, and existing methods either prioritize task performance or privacy protection, with privacy measures often constraining task effectiveness. There's a need to jointly address both objectives in robotic navigation.

Method: A novel fully joint-learning approach that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a segmentation-aware discriminator to perform semantic segmentation on ultra-low-resolution RGB images for privacy-preserving semantic object-goal navigation.

Result: The method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution semantic segmentation and the improved segmentation results increase the success rate of semantic object-goal navigation in real-world privacy-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed joint-learning method successfully enables privacy-preserving robot navigation by effectively recovering semantic information from ultra-low-resolution images, demonstrating that both privacy protection and navigation performance can be achieved simultaneously.

Abstract: User privacy in mobile robotics has become a critical concern. Existing
methods typically prioritize either the performance of downstream robotic tasks
or privacy protection, with the latter often constraining the effectiveness of
task execution. To jointly address both objectives, we study semantic-based
robot navigation in an ultra-low-resolution setting to preserve visual privacy.
A key challenge in such scenarios is recovering semantic segmentation from
ultra-low-resolution RGB images. In this work, we introduce a novel fully
joint-learning method that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a
segmentation-aware discriminator to solve ultra-low-resolution semantic
segmentation, thereby enabling privacy-preserving, semantic object-goal
navigation. Our method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution
semantic segmentation and our improved segmentation results increase the
success rate of the semantic object-goal navigation in a real-world
privacy-constrained scenario.

*Batu Candan,Simone Servadio*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A computer vision and adaptive filtering pipeline for robust relative pose estimation of tumbling satellites in Active Debris Removal missions, featuring CNN-based corner detection and dual-adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter for enhanced navigation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active Debris Removal missions targeting tumbling derelict satellites like ESA's ENVISAT require accurate and robust relative pose estimation for safe proximity operations, which is challenging due to measurement uncertainties and dynamic model complexities.

Method: An integrated pipeline combining CNN-enhanced computer vision for structural marker detection, camera modeling for 3D measurement conversion, and a dual-adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter that dynamically tunes both measurement and process noise covariances based on CNN uncertainty and residual analysis.

Result: High-fidelity simulations using realistic ENVISAT model demonstrate enhanced robustness against measurement imperfections and dynamic model uncertainties, with successful performance evaluation under various conditions including measurement outages.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-adaptive integrated system significantly advances onboard relative navigation capabilities for ADR missions, providing a comprehensive solution that handles both measurement uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics for safe proximity operations around tumbling satellites.

Abstract: Accurate and robust relative pose estimation is crucial for enabling
challenging Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions targeting tumbling derelict
satellites such as ESA's ENVISAT. This work presents a complete pipeline
integrating advanced computer vision techniques with adaptive nonlinear
filtering to address this challenge. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
enhanced with image preprocessing, detects structural markers (corners) from
chaser imagery, whose 2D coordinates are converted to 3D measurements using
camera modeling. These measurements are fused within an Unscented Kalman Filter
(UKF) framework, selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relative
dynamics, to estimate the full relative pose. Key contributions include the
integrated system architecture and a dual adaptive strategy within the UKF:
dynamic tuning of the measurement noise covariance compensates for varying CNN
measurement uncertainty, while adaptive tuning of the process noise covariance,
utilizing measurement residual analysis, accounts for unmodeled dynamics or
maneuvers online. This dual adaptation enhances robustness against both
measurement imperfections and dynamic model uncertainties. The performance of
the proposed adaptive integrated system is evaluated through high-fidelity
simulations using a realistic ENVISAT model, comparing estimates against ground
truth under various conditions, including measurement outages. This
comprehensive approach offers an enhanced solution for robust onboard relative
navigation, significantly advancing the capabilities required for safe
proximity operations during ADR missions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study investigated how people evaluate robot behaviors when assisting individuals with disabilities or advanced age, using cognitive-affective mapping to enhance participant reflection despite limited real-world robot experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research is scarce on how people assess robot behaviors with diverse human needs, particularly for protected groups like those with disabilities or advanced age, due to participants' limited experience with advanced domestic robots.

Method: Online study with 112 participants evaluating 7 videos from 28 variations of human-robot collaboration. Experimental group completed cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise before rating, while control group provided direct ratings.

Result: CAM reflection didn't significantly affect overall ratings but led to more pronounced assessments for specific robot-human combinations. Antisocial robot behavior rated lowest, collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations, and object handover scenarios were viewed more positively.

Conclusion: Both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, emphasizing the importance of prosocial design. Reflective methods like CAM can elicit nuanced feedback to support development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems for diverse populations.

Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical
questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting
with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or
advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying
robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since
participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.
In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that
enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support
meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112
participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos
from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The
experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise
on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM
reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more
pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human
condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences
the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,
while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.
Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those
without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and
interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative
robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight
the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,
supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic
systems tailored to diverse populations.

Motivation: Extrinsic calibration is critical for autonomous driving safety, but modern multi-sensor systems make data alignment challenging. Accurate calibration is essential for the perception pipeline, as calibration errors can compromise vehicle safety.

Method: The authors develop a target-based calibration system using a custom ChArUco board combined with a tailored nonlinear optimization method. This approach enables cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with minimal prior knowledge requirements.

Result: Real-world testing in a warehouse environment demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method, showing successful alignment of multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor data.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration system proves feasible and effective for multi-sensor suites, offering a unique pipeline solution that can handle various sensor types in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Extrinsic Calibration represents the cornerstone of autonomous driving. Its
accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can
have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect
different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the
data. To this end, we propose a target-based extrinsic calibration system
tailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables
cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using
a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test
the system with real-world data gathered in a warehouse. Results demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the feasibility of a
unique pipeline tailored for various types of sensors.

*Chenhao Yao,Zike Yuan,Xiaoxu Liu,Chi Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate and adjust reward functions for multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, enabling efficient formation control with collision avoidance in fewer training iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces significant challenges in Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA) due to the difficulty of designing effective reward functions that enable swift convergence to optimal solutions for complex collaborative objectives.

Method: The framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate reward functions based on task prioritization and observable agent information. The system dynamically adjusts these reward functions online using advanced evaluation metrics rather than relying solely on the rewards themselves.

Result: The proposed approach enables multi-agent systems to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to reach superior performance levels compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Empirical studies conducted in both simulation and real-world settings validate the practicality and effectiveness of the LLM-based reward function generation framework for improving MARL performance in complex multi-agent coordination tasks.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplishing complex objectives through
the collaborative efforts of individual agents. Among the methodologies
employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of
the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex
objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an
effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy
network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework
that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on
the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each
agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically
adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced
evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables
the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in
dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to
reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both
simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness
of our proposed approach.

### [293] [Toward Routine CSP of Pharmaceuticals: A Fully Automated Protocol Using Neural Network Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16218)
*Zachary L. Glick,Derek P. Metcalf,Scott F. Swarthout*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A fully automated, high-throughput crystal structure prediction (CSP) protocol using a novel neural network potential (Lavo-NN) that significantly reduces computational costs and enables routine deployment in pharmaceutical development for polymorph identification and risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crystal structure prediction is valuable for pharmaceutical development to identify and assess polymorphism risks, but widespread adoption has been limited by high computational costs and the requirement for manual specification and expert knowledge to achieve useful results.

Method: Development of Lavo-NN, a specialized neural network potential architected and trained for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking, integrated into a scalable cloud-based workflow for fully automated, high-throughput CSP.

Result: Successfully validated on 49 unique drug-like molecules, generating structures matching all 110 Z'=1 experimental polymorphs with average computational cost of 8.4k CPU hours (significant reduction vs other protocols). Demonstrated practical utility through case studies resolving experimental ambiguities and semi-blinded challenges identifying polymorphs from powder X-ray diffraction patterns.

Conclusion: The protocol significantly reduces time and cost requirements, enabling CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in drug discovery (e.g., during lead optimization) and run in parallel with experimental screening to provide real-time insights for chemists.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is a useful tool in pharmaceutical
development for identifying and assessing risks associated with polymorphism,
yet widespread adoption has been hindered by high computational costs and the
need for both manual specification and expert knowledge to achieve useful
results. Here, we introduce a fully automated, high-throughput CSP protocol
designed to overcome these barriers. The protocol's efficiency is driven by
Lavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained
specifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This
NNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based
workflow. We validate this CSP protocol on an extensive retrospective benchmark
of 49 unique molecules, almost all of which are drug-like, successfully
generating structures that match all 110 $Z' = 1$ experimental polymorphs. The
average CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours,
which is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical
utility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that
resolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that
successfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder
X-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time
and cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug
discovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization. Rapid turnaround times
and high throughput also enable CSP that can be run in parallel with
experimental screening, providing chemists with real-time insights to guide
their work in the lab.

### [294] [Recursive Equations For Imputation Of Missing Not At Random Data With Sparse Pattern Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16107)
*Trung Phung,Kyle Reese,Ilya Shpitser,Rohit Bhattacharya*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces MISPR (Multivariate Imputation via Supported Pattern Recursion), a new missing data imputation algorithm that works for both MAR and MNAR settings without requiring additional parametric assumptions, addressing limitations of existing methods like MICE that assume MAR and impose unrealistic distributional assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiple imputation methods like MICE and Amelia assume data are missing at random (MAR) and impose parametric or smoothing assumptions on imputing distributions, which are unrealistic in practice and introduce model misspecification bias. These methods struggle with missing data patterns that have no support in the data, requiring additional assumptions beyond the missing data model.

Method: The authors develop a new characterization for the full data law in graphical models of missing data that is constructive and easily adapted for calculating imputation distributions under both MAR and MNAR mechanisms. Based on this characterization, they create MISPR, which uses Gibbs sampling similar to MICE but remains consistent under both MAR and MNAR settings without imposing additional assumptions.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that MISPR achieves comparable results to MICE when data are MAR, and superior, less biased results when data are MNAR. The method successfully handles missing data patterns with no support without requiring additional distributional assumptions beyond those in the missing data model itself.

Conclusion: MISPR represents a principled step toward making missing data methods more practical for applied settings where data are likely MNAR and high-dimensional enough to yield missing patterns with no support at available sample sizes. The new characterization and algorithm provide a theoretically sound alternative to existing imputation methods.

Abstract: A common approach for handling missing values in data analysis pipelines is
multiple imputation via software packages such as MICE (Van Buuren and
Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) and Amelia (Honaker et al., 2011). These packages
typically assume the data are missing at random (MAR), and impose parametric or
smoothing assumptions upon the imputing distributions in a way that allows
imputation to proceed even if not all missingness patterns have support in the
data. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and induce model
misspecification bias on any analysis performed after such imputation.
  In this paper, we provide a principled alternative. Specifically, we develop
a new characterization for the full data law in graphical models of missing
data. This characterization is constructive, is easily adapted for the
calculation of imputation distributions for both MAR and MNAR (missing not at
random) mechanisms, and is able to handle lack of support for certain patterns
of missingness. We use this characterization to develop a new imputation
algorithm -- Multivariate Imputation via Supported Pattern Recursion (MISPR) --
which uses Gibbs sampling, by analogy with the Multivariate Imputation with
Chained Equations (MICE) algorithm, but which is consistent under both MAR and
MNAR settings, and is able to handle missing data patterns with no support
without imposing additional assumptions beyond those already imposed by the
missing data model itself.
  In simulations, we show MISPR obtains comparable results to MICE when data
are MAR, and superior, less biased results when data are MNAR. Our
characterization and imputation algorithm based on it are a step towards making
principled missing data methods more practical in applied settings, where the
data are likely both MNAR and sufficiently high dimensional to yield missing
data patterns with no support at available sample sizes.

### [295] [Adaptive Multi-task Learning for Multi-sector Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16433)
*Qingliang Fan,Ruike Wu,Yanrong Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-adaptive multi-task learning methodology for multi-sector portfolio optimization that learns relationships between factor models across different sectors, improving both factor model estimation and portfolio performance through a novel projection-penalized principal component analysis algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate information transfer across multiple sectors is crucial but challenging in multi-sector portfolio optimization with large numbers of assets from different classes. Existing approaches struggle to effectively quantify and leverage the relatedness among principal temporal subspaces across sectors, leading to suboptimal factor model estimation and portfolio performance.

Method: The authors develop a data-adaptive multi-task learning framework within factor modeling that quantifies and learns relatedness among principal temporal subspaces across multiple sectors. They introduce a novel projection-penalized principal component analysis algorithm to implement the multi-task learning procedure, enabling simultaneous estimation of multiple factor models while leveraging cross-sector information.

Result: The methodology demonstrates improved simultaneous estimation of multiple factor models and enhanced multi-sector portfolio optimization performance. Validation through diverse simulation designs and practical application on daily return data from Russell 3000 index shows the advantages of the proposed multi-task learning approach over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed data-adaptive multi-task learning methodology with projection-penalized principal component analysis successfully addresses the challenge of information transfer across sectors in portfolio optimization, leading to better factor model recovery and improved portfolio performance, as demonstrated through both simulations and real-world financial data.

Abstract: Accurate transfer of information across multiple sectors to enhance model
estimation is both significant and challenging in multi-sector portfolio
optimization involving a large number of assets in different classes. Within
the framework of factor modeling, we propose a novel data-adaptive multi-task
learning methodology that quantifies and learns the relatedness among the
principal temporal subspaces (spanned by factors) across multiple sectors under
study. This approach not only improves the simultaneous estimation of multiple
factor models but also enhances multi-sector portfolio optimization, which
heavily depends on the accurate recovery of these factor models. Additionally,
a novel and easy-to-implement algorithm, termed projection-penalized principal
component analysis, is developed to accomplish the multi-task learning
procedure. Diverse simulation designs and practical application on daily return

### [296] [Beyond Rate Coding: Surrogate Gradients Enable Spike Timing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16043)
*Ziqiao Yu,Pengfei Sun,Dan F. M. Goodman*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent can learn from precise spike timing information beyond just firing rates, using synthetic tasks and modified speech recognition datasets where spike count information is eliminated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if SNNs can truly exploit temporal spike timing information rather than just relying on firing rate coding, which is crucial for determining whether SNNs offer genuine advantages over traditional artificial neural networks in processing temporal information.

Method: The authors designed synthetic tasks focusing on intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony with matched spike counts, created modified versions of SHD and SSC speech datasets with eliminated spike count information, and tested SNNs trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent with and without delay learning under various biologically inspired perturbations.

Result: SNNs trained with Surrogate GD performed significantly above chance on timing-only tasks while rate-based models performed at chance level. Networks showed consistent but perturbation-specific degradation under biological perturbations, and exhibited sharp performance drops when spike sequences were time-reversed, with delay-trained networks showing larger drops indicating more human-like temporal processing behavior.

Conclusion: SNNs can indeed learn from precise spike timing information beyond firing rates when trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent, demonstrating genuine temporal coding capabilities that distinguish them from rate-based approaches, though performance varies depending on the type of temporal perturbation applied.

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained
with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay
learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first
design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and
cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based
speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech
Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is
eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate
GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely
rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under
biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or
per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but
perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when
spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from
SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in
terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have
released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.

*Marcel C. Bühler,Ye Yuan,Xueting Li,Yangyi Huang,Koki Nagano,Umar Iqbal*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DLA is a framework that creates animatable 3D human avatars from a single image by using video diffusion models to generate multi-views, lifting them to 3D Gaussians, and mapping them to UV space for pose-driven animation with real-time rendering capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between unstructured 3D representations and high-fidelity, animation-ready avatars by creating animatable 3D human avatars from just a single input image, enabling real-time rendering and intuitive editing without post-processing.

Method: The method involves three main steps: (1) dreaming plausible multi-views from a single image using video diffusion models, (2) lifting these views into unstructured 3D Gaussians, and (3) using a transformer-based encoder to project Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned with UV space of a parametric body model for pose-aware animation.

Result: DLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric accuracy, while enabling real-time rendering and maintaining consistency during animation with preserved fine visual details.

Conclusion: By combining generative strengths of video diffusion models with pose-aware UV-space Gaussian mapping, DLA successfully creates high-quality animatable avatars from single images, ensuring animation consistency while preserving visual details and enabling real-time applications.

Abstract: We introduce Dream, Lift, Animate (DLA), a novel framework that reconstructs
animatable 3D human avatars from a single image. This is achieved by leveraging
multi-view generation, 3D Gaussian lifting, and pose-aware UV-space mapping of
3D Gaussians. Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a
video diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These
views are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we
propose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships
and projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned
with the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into
UV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and
rendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV
manifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine
visual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without
requiring post-processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
on ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric
accuracy. By combining the generative strengths of video diffusion models with
a pose-aware UV-space Gaussian mapping, DLA bridges the gap between
unstructured 3D representations and high-fidelity, animation-ready avatars.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba (MSGM), a novel EEG-based emotion recognition framework that combines multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling, and Mamba architecture to achieve superior accuracy and real-time computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based emotion recognition faces challenges in capturing multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications. Existing methods oversimplify temporal granularity and spatial hierarchies, which limits their accuracy in emotion classification tasks.

Method: The proposed MSGM framework integrates three key components: (1) multi-window temporal segmentation to capture diverse temporal scales, (2) bimodal spatial graph modeling with neuroanatomical priors to construct global-local graphs, and (3) efficient fusion using Mamba architecture with multi-depth Graph Convolutional Networks and token embedding fusion for dynamic spatiotemporal interaction at linear complexity.

Result: MSGM outperforms leading methods on three datasets (SEED, THU-EP, and FACED) for subject-independent emotion classification. The framework achieves robust accuracy while maintaining millisecond-level inference speed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, demonstrating both superior performance and real-time computational efficiency with just one MSST-Mamba layer.

Conclusion: The Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba successfully addresses the limitations of existing EEG-based emotion recognition methods by effectively capturing fine-grained emotional fluctuations and hierarchical brain connectivity while achieving linear computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition struggles with capturing multi-scale

*Da Fan,David John Gagne II,Steven J. Greybush,Eugene E. Clothiaux,John S. Schreck,Chaopeng Shen*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This study compared five Bayesian deep learning methods against a deterministic ResNet for 0-1 hour convective initiation forecasting using satellite data, finding that initial-weights ensemble + Monte Carlo dropout produced the most skillful and well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, though with some generalization limitations in non-convective regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deterministic neural networks for convective initiation nowcasting lack uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for meteorological forecasting. The study aims to evaluate whether Bayesian deep learning methods can provide better probabilistic forecasts with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates compared to deterministic approaches.

Method: The researchers evaluated five Bayesian deep learning methods against a deterministic ResNet baseline using GOES-16 satellite infrared observations for 0-1 hour convective initiation forecasting. Methods included initial-weights ensemble + Monte Carlo dropout, Bayesian ResNet ensemble, and Bayesian-MOPED ResNet ensemble. They assessed forecast skill, calibration, and uncertainty quantification performance.

Result: Most Bayesian methods outperformed the deterministic ResNet. The initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout achieved the best performance with skillful and well-calibrated forecasts by thoroughly sampling the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble performed worse at longer lead times due to optimization challenges. The Bayesian-MOPED ensemble improved performance by constraining hypothesis search. All Bayesian methods showed well-calibrated uncertainty and effectively separated large and small forecast errors.

Conclusion: Bayesian deep learning methods, particularly initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout, can significantly improve convective initiation forecasting by providing better probabilistic forecasts and uncertainty quantification. However, trade-offs exist between forecast skill in convective regions and generalization in non-convective areas. The Bayesian-MOPED approach offers a promising solution for balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This study evaluated the probability and uncertainty forecasts of five
recently proposed Bayesian deep learning methods relative to a deterministic
residual neural network (ResNet) baseline for 0-1 h convective initiation (CI)
nowcasting using GOES-16 satellite infrared observations. Uncertainty was
assessed by how well probabilistic forecasts were calibrated and how well
uncertainty separated forecasts with large and small errors. Most of the
Bayesian deep learning methods produced probabilistic forecasts that
outperformed the deterministic ResNet, with one, the initial-weights ensemble +
Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, an ensemble of deterministic ResNets with different
initial weights to start training and dropout activated during inference,
producing the most skillful and well-calibrated forecasts. The initial-weights
ensemble + MC dropout benefited from generating multiple solutions that more
thoroughly sampled the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble was the
only one that performed worse than the deterministic ResNet at longer lead
times, likely due to the challenge of optimizing a larger number of parameters.
To address this issue, the Bayesian-MOPED (MOdel Priors with Empirical Bayes
using Deep neural network) ResNet ensemble was adopted, and it enhanced
forecast skill by constraining the hypothesis search near the deterministic
ResNet hypothesis. All Bayesian methods demonstrated well-calibrated
uncertainty and effectively separated cases with large and small errors. In
case studies, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout demonstrated better
forecast skill than the Bayesian-MOPED ensemble and the deterministic ResNet on
selected CI events in clear-sky regions. However, the initial-weights ensemble
+ MC dropout exhibited poorer generalization in clear-sky and anvil cloud
regions without CI occurrence compared to the deterministic ResNet and
Bayesian-MOPED ensemble.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors recognize that proper loss function selection is crucial for machine learning models in quantitative finance applications, particularly for algorithmic investment strategies. Traditional loss functions may not be adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used in financial trading, necessitating the development of a more suitable loss function.

Method: The researchers introduce the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL) function and conduct empirical experiments comparing its performance across Transformer and LSTM models. The experiments are conducted on both equity and cryptocurrency assets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function in real financial market scenarios.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that Transformer models consistently and significantly outperform LSTM models when using the MADL function. This superior performance is observed across almost all test cases involving both equity and cryptocurrency assets.

Conclusion: The MADL function proves to be more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models in algorithmic investment strategies compared to traditional loss functions. Additionally, the research establishes that Transformer architectures are superior to LSTM models for quantitative finance applications when properly optimized with the proposed loss function.

Abstract: The proper design and architecture of testing of machine learning models,
especially in their application to quantitative finance problems, is crucial.
The most important in this process is selecting an adequate loss function used
for training, validation, estimation purposes, and tuning of hyperparameters.
Therefore, in this research, through empirical experiments on equity and
cryptocurrency assets, we introduce the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL)
function which is more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used

TL;DR: This study develops a dual-dictionary framework (BM1.0) to make radiomics-based AI models more interpretable for breast cancer diagnosis by mapping radiomic features to standardized BI-RADS descriptors, achieving 83% accuracy in classifying triple-negative breast cancer while providing clinically meaningful explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiomics-based AI models for breast cancer diagnosis lack interpretability, which limits their clinical adoption. There is a significant gap between complex radiomic features and the standardized BI-RADS lexicon that clinicians use, making it difficult to integrate AI predictions into routine clinical practice.

Method: The researchers created a dual-dictionary framework consisting of: (1) a Clinically-Informed Feature Interpretation Dictionary (CIFID) mapping 56 radiomic features to BI-RADS descriptors through literature review and expert consultation, and (2) a Data-Driven Feature Interpretation Dictionary (DDFID) for 52 additional features using SHAP explanations. They trained 27 machine learning classifiers with 27 feature selection methods on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data from 1,549 patients across multiple institutions.

Result: The best performing model combined Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) feature selection with Extra Trees Classifier, achieving 83% cross-validation accuracy for TNBC classification. Key findings showed that higher Sphericity (indicating round/oval shape) and lower Busyness (indicating more homogeneous enhancement) were associated with TNBC, aligning with established clinical knowledge while also revealing novel interpretable associations.

Conclusion: The dual-dictionary framework (BM1.0) successfully enhances AI model transparency by bridging radiomic features with clinical terminology. It confirms known imaging biomarkers while discovering new interpretable associations, supporting the integration of radiomic features into routine breast cancer diagnosis and personalized care through improved clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Radiomics-based AI models show promise for breast cancer diagnosis but often
lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption. This study addresses the gap
between radiomic features (RF) and the standardized BI-RADS lexicon by
proposing a dual-dictionary framework. First, a Clinically-Informed Feature
Interpretation Dictionary (CIFID) was created by mapping 56 RFs to BI-RADS
descriptors (shape, margin, internal enhancement) through literature and expert
review. The framework was applied to classify triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) versus non-TNBC using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from a
multi-institutional cohort of 1,549 patients. We trained 27 machine learning
classifiers with 27 feature selection methods. SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) were used to interpret predictions and generate a complementary
Data-Driven Feature Interpretation Dictionary (DDFID) for 52 additional RFs.
The best model, combining Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) selection with Extra
Trees Classifier, achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of 0.83. Key
predictive RFs aligned with clinical knowledge: higher Sphericity (round/oval
shape) and lower Busyness (more homogeneous enhancement) were associated with
TNBC. The framework confirmed known imaging biomarkers and uncovered novel,
interpretable associations. This dual-dictionary approach (BM1.0) enhances AI
model transparency and supports the integration of RFs into routine breast
cancer diagnosis and personalized care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography (mfEIT) is a promising biomedical imaging modality for estimating tissue conductivities across frequency ranges, but requires improved reconstruction methods that can leverage both classical iterative approaches and deep learning capabilities.

Method: The paper presents a variational network that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton (PRGN) framework. The approach unrolls the PRGN algorithm where each iteration corresponds to a network layer, combining physical insights from nonlinear model fitting with GNN's ability to capture inter-frequency correlations while preserving irregular triangular mesh structure.

Result: The GNN architecture successfully preserves the irregular triangular mesh structure used in the nonlinear forward model solution, enabling accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations in multi-frequency EIT imaging.

Conclusion: The proposed variational network effectively merges classical iterative reconstruction methods with deep learning, providing an interpretable model-based learning paradigm that leverages both physical insights and neural network capabilities for improved mfEIT reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography (mfEIT) represents a

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel data-driven approach using modified DeepONet architecture enhances gradient reconstruction in unstructured finite volume methods for 2D Euler equations, achieving 20-60% accuracy improvements over traditional second-order schemes while maintaining physical constraints and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional second-order finite volume schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws on unstructured meshes have limitations in accuracy and efficiency, particularly in shock-dominated regions. There is a need to extend successful structured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes while maintaining physical consistency and conservation properties.

Method: The approach uses a modified DeepONet architecture that incorporates local mesh geometry and topology to ensure rotation invariance and first-order constraints. The training methodology includes physics-informed regularization through entropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter regularization. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial conditions with periodic boundary conditions.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order finite volume schemes, achieving 20-60% gains in solution accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency. Convergence studies show improved mesh convergence rates, and validation on challenging geometry configurations confirms robust performance across complex flow configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed ML-enhanced finite volume solver successfully combines machine learning tools with traditional numerical schemes while preserving essential physical constraints. It enables high-fidelity simulations on coarser grids with improved stability and conservation properties, representing a new generation of hybrid ML-numerical solvers for hyperbolic conservation laws.

Abstract: We present a novel data-driven approach for enhancing gradient reconstruction
in unstructured finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws,
specifically for the 2D Euler equations. Our approach extends previous
structured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes through a modified
DeepONet architecture that incorporates local geometry in the neural network.
The architecture employs local mesh topology to ensure rotation invariance,
while also ensuring first-order constraint on the learned operator. The
training methodology incorporates physics-informed regularization through
entropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter
regularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in
shock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets
solutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial
conditions with periodic boundary conditions, enabling robust generalization to
complex flow configurations or geometries. Validation test cases from the
literature, including challenging geometry configuration, demonstrates
substantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order
finite volume schemes. The method achieves gains of 20-60% in solution accuracy
while enhancing computational efficiency. A convergence study has been conveyed
and reveal improved mesh convergence rates compared to the conventional solver.
The proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than the traditional
second-order finite volume solver, enabling high-fidelity simulations on
coarser grids while preserving the stability and conservation properties
essential for hyperbolic conservation laws. This work is a part of a new
generation of solvers that are built by combining Machine-Learning (ML) tools
with traditional numerical schemes, all while ensuring physical constraint on
the results.

### [307] [Efficient dataset construction using active learning and uncertainty-aware neural networks for plasma turbulent transport surrogate models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15976)
*Aaron Ho,Lorenzo Zanisi,Bram de Leeuw,Vincent Galvan,Pablo Rodriguez-Fernandez,Nathaniel T. Howard*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: This work demonstrates using uncertainty-aware neural networks with active learning to efficiently build training datasets for plasma turbulence surrogate models, achieving good performance (F1~0.8, R²~0.75) while reducing dataset requirements from expensive physics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient methods for creating training datasets for surrogate models of expensive plasma physics simulations, specifically targeting the computational bottleneck of generating labeled data for turbulent transport predictions in fusion plasmas.

Method: Applied uncertainty-aware architectures (SNGP for classification, BNN-NCP for regression) combined with active learning techniques and QuaLiKiz physics simulation as an in-the-loop data labeller, building on the previous ADEPT framework to iteratively expand training sets from 10² to 10⁴ samples over 45 iterations.

Result: Achieved F1 classification performance of ~0.8 and R² regression performance of ~0.75 across all turbulent modes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and transport fluxes, demonstrating comparable performance to previous ADEPT pipeline while handling an additional input dimension, though with faster diminishing improvement rates than expected.

Conclusion: The technique successfully demonstrates proof-of-principle for uncertainty-aware active learning in plasma physics applications, with components that can be upgraded and generalized to other surrogate modeling problems beyond plasma turbulent transport, offering a pathway to reduce computational costs for expensive physics simulations.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a proof-of-principle for using uncertainty-aware
architectures, in combination with active learning techniques and an
in-the-loop physics simulation code as a data labeller, to construct efficient
datasets for data-driven surrogate model generation. Building off of a previous
proof-of-principle successfully demonstrating training set reduction on static
pre-labelled datasets, using the ADEPT framework, this strategy was applied
again to the plasma turbulent transport problem within tokamak fusion plasmas,
specifically the QuaLiKiz quasilinear electrostatic gyrokinetic turbulent
transport code. While QuaLiKiz provides relatively fast evaluations, this study
specifically targeted small datasets to serve as a proxy for more expensive
codes, such as CGYRO or GENE. The newly implemented algorithm uses the SNGP
architecture for the classification component of the problem and the BNN-NCP
architecture for the regression component, training models for all turbulent
modes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and all transport fluxes ($Q_e$, $Q_i$, $\Gamma_e$,
$\Gamma_i$, and $\Pi_i$) described by the general QuaLiKiz output. With 45
active learning iterations, moving from a small initial training set of
$10^{2}$ to a final set of $10^{4}$, the resulting models reached a $F_1$
classification performance of ~0.8 and a $R^2$ regression performance of ~0.75
on an independent test set across all outputs. This extrapolates to reaching
the same performance and efficiency as the previous ADEPT pipeline, although on
a problem with 1 extra input dimension. While the improvement rate achieved in
this implementation diminishes faster than expected, the overall technique is
formulated with components that can be upgraded and generalized to many
surrogate modeling applications beyond plasma turbulent transport predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hydrodynamic simulations for laser fusion experiments are computationally expensive and may lack accuracy in predicting complex implosion dynamics. There is a need for AI-enhanced predictive models that can efficiently and accurately simulate laser-driven implosion experiments to improve experimental design and understanding.

Method: The researchers developed MULTI-Net, a Transformer-based deep learning model that predicts implosion features from laser waveforms and target radius inputs. They introduced a Physics-Informed Decoder (PID) for high-dimensional sampling to reduce prediction errors compared to traditional Latin hypercube sampling. The model was trained and validated using double-cone ignition (DCI) experimental data from the SG-II Upgrade facility.

Result: MULTI-Net successfully predicted implosion dynamics measured by x-ray streak cameras in DCI experiments. The model determined an effective laser absorption factor of approximately 65% for one-dimensional DCI-R10 simulations. For shot 33, the predicted mean implosion velocity was 195 km/s and collided plasma density reached 117 g/cc, showing good agreement with experimental measurements.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AI-enhanced hydrodynamic simulations can effectively predict complex laser fusion experiment dynamics. The MULTI-Net framework with Physics-Informed Decoder provides a data-driven approach that enhances prediction capabilities for complicated laser fusion experiments, potentially improving experimental design and reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: This work presents predictive hydrodynamic simulations empowered by
artificial intelligence (AI) for laser driven implosion experiments, taking the
double-cone ignition (DCI) scheme as an example. A Transformer-based deep
learning model MULTI-Net is established to predict implosion features according
to laser waveforms and target radius. A Physics-Informed Decoder (PID) is
proposed for high-dimensional sampling, significantly reducing the prediction
errors compared to Latin hypercube sampling. Applied to DCI experiments
conducted on the SG-II Upgrade facility, the MULTI-Net model is able to predict
the implosion dynamics measured by the x-ray streak camera. It is found that an
effective laser absorption factor about 65\% is suitable for the
one-dimensional simulations of the DCI-R10 experiments. For shot 33, the mean
implosion velocity and collided plasma density reached 195 km/s and 117 g/cc,
respectively. This study demonstrates a data-driven AI framework that enhances
the prediction ability of simulations for complicated laser fusion experiments.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to portfolio optimization, often rooted in Modern
Portfolio Theory and solved via quadratic programming or evolutionary
algorithms, struggle with scalability or flexibility, especially in scenarios
involving complex constraints, large datasets and/or multiple conflicting
objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce a benchmark framework for
multi-objective portfolio optimization (MPO) using gradient descent with
automatic differentiation. Our method supports any optimization objective, such
as minimizing risk measures (e.g., CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratio, along with
realistic constraints, such as tracking error limits, UCITS regulations, or
asset group restrictions. We have evaluated our framework across six
experimental scenarios, from single-objective setups to complex multi-objective
cases, and have compared its performance against standard solvers like CVXPY
and SKFOLIO. Our results show that our method achieves competitive performance
while offering enhanced flexibility for modeling multiple objectives and
constraints. We aim to provide a practical and extensible tool for researchers
and practitioners exploring advanced portfolio optimization problems in
real-world conditions.

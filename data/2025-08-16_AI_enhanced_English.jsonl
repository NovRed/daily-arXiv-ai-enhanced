To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch\nFiltering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that\nshow greater correlation with the class representation.

This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "An interpretable machine learning model (LightGBM) was developed for early AKI prediction in ICU patients with cirrhosis, achieving high accuracy and actionable insights.", "motivation": "AKI in cirrhosis patients is common and worsens outcomes, but existing predictive tools lack accuracy and workflow alignment.", "method": "Retrospective analysis of MIMIC-IV data, preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation of six ML algorithms.", "result": "LightGBM performed best (AUROC 0.808), with key predictors aligning with cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms.", "conclusion": "The model enables early AKI risk stratification, supports clinical decisions, and warrants further validation and integration."}}

Defending\nagainst backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while\npreserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we\npropose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the\nzero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By\nintegrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,\nCLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.\nTo address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against\ndiverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the\nmultimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client\nsamples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and\neliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed\naligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset\nusing prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive\nexperiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in\nASR, i.e., 2.03\\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving\naverage MA by 7.92\\% and 0.48\\%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP-Fed is a FL backdoor defense framework using vision-language models to address heterogeneous data and privacy concerns, improving defense and model performance.", "motivation": "Existing FL backdoor defenses assume homogeneous data or clean server datasets, limiting practicality.

### [1] [Structured Captions Improve Prompt Adherence in Text-to-Image Models (Re-LAION-Caption 19M)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05300)
*Nicholas Merchant,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Andrei Cristian Popescu,Carlos Garcia Jurado Suarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Structured captions improve text-to-image model alignment by enforcing a four-part template (subject, setting, aesthetics, camera details), outperforming noisy datasets like LAION-5B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle with prompt adherence due to noisy datasets, requiring heavy prompt engineering. Structured captions aim to enhance controllability.

Method: Created Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality dataset with structured captions. Fine-tuned PixArt-Σ and Stable Diffusion 2 using structured vs. shuffled captions.

Result: Models trained with structured captions achieved higher text-image alignment scores via VQA models.

Conclusion: Enforcing caption structure during training improves model alignment and controllability, reducing reliance on prompt engineering.

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/supermodelresearch/Re-LAION-Caption19M.

### [2] [CorrDetail: Visual Detail Enhanced Self-Correction for Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05302)
*Binjia Zhou,Hengrui Lou,Lizhe Chen,Haoyuan Li,Dawei Luo,Shuai Chen,Jie Lei,Zunlei Feng,Yijun Bei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CorrDetail is a visual detail enhanced self-correction framework for interpretable deepfake detection, addressing shortcomings of existing methods by focusing on authentic forgery details and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology necessitates more effective detection methods, as current approaches lack interpretability or suffer from hallucinations.

Method: CorrDetail uses error-guided questioning to correct forgery details, includes a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module, and employs a fusion decision strategy for better performance.

Result: CorrDetail achieves state-of-the-art performance, accurately identifies forged details, and shows strong generalization.

Conclusion: CorrDetail offers a reliable and interpretable solution for deepfake detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

*Aquino Joctum,John Kandiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-APD enhances YOLOv8 for pedestrian detection on complex roadways, achieving high accuracy (77.7% mAP) and real-time performance (100 FPS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving pedestrian detection on geometrically complex roadways where standard RGB camera methods fall short.

Method: Integrates SimAM attention, C3Ghost modules, SimSPPF, Mish activation, and IGD module, with adaptive ROI processing using steering dynamics.

Result: 77.7% mAP@0.5:0.95, 96% recall, 100 FPS, outperforming YOLOv8.

Conclusion: YOLO-APD offers accurate, efficient, adaptable perception for autonomous vehicles in challenging environments.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,
efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors,
contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in
challenging, less-structured driving environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlight is a virtual staining method using histogram-based foreground estimation and Dice loss to improve focus on biologically relevant structures in 3D microscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual staining methods treat all pixels equally, reproducing noise instead of focusing on meaningful signals.

Method: Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss and employs Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware learning.

Result: Applied to a 3D dataset, Spotlight enhances morphological representation while maintaining pixel-level accuracy, improving virtual stains for tasks like segmentation.

Conclusion: Spotlight outperforms existing methods by focusing on relevant cellular structures, making it more suitable for downstream applications.

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

*Vishal Nedungadi,Xingguo Xiong,Aike Potze,Ron Van Bree,Tao Lin,Marc Rußwurm,Ioannis N. Athanasiadis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates existing foundation models for agricultural tasks, proposes a framework for an ideal agricultural model (CropFM), and highlights the need for a dedicated model tailored to agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing food security challenges by leveraging foundation models for agricultural monitoring, given their success in remote sensing and climate sciences.

Method: Quantitative evaluation of existing foundation models, development of a requirements framework (CropFM), and empirical evaluation of two models in three agricultural tasks.

Result: Existing models are under-explored for agriculture; a dedicated foundational model (CropFM) is needed for better performance in agricultural tasks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of foundation models in agriculture but calls for specialized models like CropFM to address domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

### [6] [Enhancing Underwater Images Using Deep Learning with Subjective Image Quality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05393)
*Jose M. Montero,Jose-Luis Lisani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach enhances underwater images by integrating human assessments, using GANs trained on expert-labeled datasets, achieving improved quality in both subjective and objective metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater image quality by leveraging deep learning and incorporating human subjective assessments for more accurate enhancements.

Method: Train a classifier to distinguish image quality, then use GANs with enhancement criteria (e.g., color fidelity, sharpness) to refine low-quality images.

Result: The model significantly improves image quality, validated by metrics (PSNR, SSIM, UIQM) and qualitative analysis.

Conclusion: Incorporating human assessments and specific enhancement criteria in GANs effectively enhances underwater image quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

### [7] [pFedMMA: Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning with Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05394)
*Sajjad Ghiasvand,Mahnoosh Alizadeh,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: pFedMMA is a personalized federated learning framework using multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks, balancing personalization and generalization efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to decentralized, heterogeneous data without sacrificing generalization is challenging. Existing methods often favor personalization over generalization.

Method: pFedMMA employs multi-modal adapters with modality-specific and globally shared projections. It uses asymmetric optimization for local adaptation and global alignment, ensuring communication efficiency.

Result: Experiments on eleven datasets show pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming federated prompt tuning methods.

Conclusion: pFedMMA effectively addresses the challenge of adapting VLMs in federated settings, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoongX is a hands-free image editing system using neurophysiological signals (EEG, fNIRS, PPG, and head motion) to drive generative models, achieving performance comparable to text-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image editing is labor-intensive and inaccessible to some users. LoongX aims to make it intuitive and accessible via brain-computer interfaces.

Method: LoongX uses diffusion models trained on 23,928 image editing pairs with synchronized neuro signals. It integrates CS3 and DGF modules for feature encoding and fusion, aligned with edit semantics via DiT.

Result: LoongX matches text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558) and outperforms them when combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

Conclusion: LoongX demonstrates the potential of neural-driven generative models for accessible image editing, paving the way for cognitive-driven creative technologies.

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Method: In-depth categorization of methods by generative strategies, analysis of architectures, conditioning mechanisms, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements, enabling clearer comparisons and highlighting open challenges.

Conclusion: Offers a foundational reference for researchers navigating the evolving field of motion generation.

various conditioning inputs, has become a central problem in computer vision,
computer graphics, and robotics, with applications ranging from animation and
virtual agents to human-robot interaction. As the field has rapidly progressed
with the introduction of diverse modeling paradigms including GANs,
autoencoders, autoregressive models, and diffusion-based techniques, each
approach brings its own advantages and limitations. This growing diversity has
created a need for a comprehensive and structured review that specifically
examines recent developments from the perspective of the generative approach
employed.
  In this survey, we provide an in-depth categorization of motion generation
methods based on their underlying generative strategies. Our main focus is on
papers published in top-tier venues since 2023, reflecting the most recent
advancements in the field. In addition, we analyze architectural principles,
conditioning mechanisms, and generation settings, and compile a detailed
overview of the evaluation metrics and datasets used across the literature. Our
objective is to enable clearer comparisons and identify open challenges,
thereby offering a timely and foundational reference for researchers and
practitioners navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of motion generation.

### [10] [Mastering Regional 3DGS: Locating, Initializing, and Editing with Diverse 2D Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05426)
*Lanqing Guo,Yufei Wang,Hezhen Hu,Yan Zheng,Yeying Jin,Siyu Huang,Zhangyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for precise local 3D scene editing using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and 2D diffusion editing, addressing challenges in 3D semantic parsing. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D semantic parsing underperforms compared to 2D, making targeted 3D edits difficult. The goal is to enhance control and fidelity in local 3D scene editing.

Method: Leverages 2D diffusion editing for region identification, inverse rendering for 3D localization, and refines views iteratively with depth maps from a 2D foundation model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a 4× speedup, enabling efficient and effective local editing.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust, view-consistent approach to 3D scene editing, improving both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

TL;DR: OpenWorldSAM extends SAM2 for open-vocabulary segmentation using multi-modal embeddings, achieving efficiency and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of segmenting objects with open-ended language prompts and diverse categories.

Method: Integrates a vision-language model with SAM2, focusing on unified prompting, efficiency, instance awareness, and generalization.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation across benchmarks like ADE20k and PASCAL.

Conclusion: OpenWorldSAM effectively grounds language semantics into spatial masks, handling unseen categories with minimal training.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI-driven variable rate sprayer system was developed to reduce herbicide overuse by detecting weeds and adjusting spray in real time, showing promising results in indoor trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like high costs, pollution, and herbicide resistance caused by uniform herbicide application in agriculture.

Method: Integrated lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg models on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for real-time weed detection and canopy segmentation, with Arduino-controlled nozzles.

Result: High precision (0.99) and recall (1.0) for detection; segmentation showed lower performance. Spray coverage adjusted effectively based on canopy size.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for selective herbicide application using deep learning and low-cost hardware, with plans to expand weed detection and field validation.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

*Md Zahid Hasan,Guillermo Basulto-Elias,Jun Ha Chang,Sahuna Hallmark,Matthew Rizzo,Anuj Sharma,Soumik Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using naturalistic driving videos and large vision models to identify cognitive decline in older drivers, offering a scalable and non-invasive diagnostic tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for diagnosing cognitive decline like Alzheimer's disease are time-consuming and costly. The research aims to leverage driving behavior as a digital fingerprint for early detection.

Method: A framework using large vision models to analyze driving videos, classify cognitive status, and predict disease progression by correlating driving patterns with clinical features.

Result: The method identifies early warning signs of cognitive impairment, enabling proactive interventions.

Conclusion: This approach enhances early detection and supports scalable, non-invasive monitoring to reduce the societal and economic impact of cognitive decline.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural images exhibit scale invariance, unlike the white noise used in traditional diffusion models, suggesting that scale-invariant noise could improve performance.

Method: Proposes using scale-invariant noise profiles in diffusion models instead of white noise, forming "Cloud Diffusion Models."

Result: Expected benefits include faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability.

Conclusion: A follow-up study will compare Cloud Diffusion Models with traditional white noise models to validate these claims.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

*Giulio Federico,Fabio Carrara,Claudio Gennaro,Giuseppe Amato,Marco Di Benedetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoomNet is a multi-view diffusion architecture that generates consistent multi-view images from a single input, improving 3D mesh quality by leveraging a shared latent space for view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating spatially consistent multi-view images from a single image degrades 3D mesh quality in surface reconstruction.

Method: LoomNet applies a diffusion model in parallel across views, fuses encodings into aggregated planes, and processes them to propagate information and interpolate missing regions.

Result: LoomNet produces 16 high-quality, coherent views in 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in image quality and reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: LoomNet effectively addresses view consistency challenges, offering high-quality, diverse, and plausible novel views from a single input.

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves
state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on
ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.

modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional
attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable
fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in
storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these
trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions, especially Africa, to enhance perception in low-resource settings.

Method: Procedural augmentation pipeline with refractive (lens distortion, noise, warps) and weather (fog, lens flare) modules. Evaluated using three image restoration models.

Result: Released toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and benchmark results to support perception research in underrepresented African contexts.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust perception research in low-resource settings without costly data collection or simulation.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions,
particularly across Africa's diverse urban, rural, and unpaved roads, remains a
key obstacle to robust perception in low-resource settings. We present a
procedural augmentation pipeline that enhances low-cost monocular dashcam
footage with realistic refractive distortions and weather-induced artifacts
tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free
(incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous
fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or
simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and
benchmark results.

*Jiaxu Tian,Xuehui Yu,Yaoxing Wang,Pan Wang,Guangqian Guo,Shan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReLayout improves layout generation by using relation-CoT to better interpret spatial relationships and introduces a rebalance sampler for diverse, structured layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods inadequately interpret spatial relationships, causing structural and diversity issues in layout generation.

Method: ReLayout enhances layout annotations with explicit relation definitions (region, salient, margin) and introduces a layout prototype rebalance sampler for structured and diverse layouts.

Result: ReLayout outperforms baselines, generating more structured, diverse, and aesthetically coherent layouts.

Conclusion: ReLayout addresses limitations of LLM-based methods, producing layouts better aligned with human aesthetics and explainability.

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

### [19] [Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing via Cross-Modal Feature Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05575)
*Jun-Xiong Chong,Fang-Yu Hsu,Ming-Tsung Hsu,Yi-Ting Lin,Kai-Heng Chien,Chiou-Ting Hsu,Pei-Kai Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CTNet, a Cross-modal Transition-guided Network, to improve multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) by addressing distribution discrepancies and missing modalities during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage consistent cross-modal feature transitions for live faces and inconsistent ones for spoof faces to enhance FAS robustness, especially when modalities are missing.

Method: CTNet learns consistent cross-modal feature transitions for live samples and inconsistent ones for spoofing attacks. It also learns complementary IR and depth features from RGB to handle missing modalities.

Result: CTNet outperforms previous multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed CTNet effectively addresses challenges in multi-modal FAS, improving performance and robustness, particularly with missing modalities.

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

*Shuai Li,Shihan Chen,Wanru Geng,Zhaohua Xu,Xiaolu Liu,Can Dong,Zhen Tian,Changlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised defect detection framework (DSYM) using conditional diffusion and pseudo-labeling improves efficiency and reduces labeling dependency in industrial quality inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defect detection methods are inefficient and costly, prompting the need for a more robust, data-efficient solution.

Method: DSYM employs a two-stage collaborative training mechanism, pseudo-labeling, and a conditional diffusion model for multi-scale pseudo-defect synthesis, with noise filtering via CLIP cross-modal features.

Result: Achieves 78.4% mAP@0.5 with full labeled data and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% labeled data, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: DSYM offers a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for industrial defect detection, validated on the NEU-DET dataset.

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

*Zhizhuo Pang,Zhihui Ke,Xiaobo Zhou,Tie Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSVR introduces a 2D Gaussian-based video representation for faster decoding (800+ FPS) and training (2s/frame) while maintaining high quality (35+ PSNR). It uses hybrid deformation fields and dynamic-aware time slicing for efficient motion modeling and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit neural video representations focus on reconstruction quality but suffer from slow decoding and training due to high computational costs. GSVR aims to address these limitations.

Method: GSVR combines tri-plane and polynomial motion patterns in a hybrid deformation field. It uses dynamic-aware time slicing for adaptive GOP division and quantization-aware fine-tuning for compression.

Result: Achieves 800+ FPS, 35+ PSNR, and 2s/frame training on Bunny. Outperforms others in decoding speed (10x faster) and has comparable interpolation and better compression than NeRV.

Conclusion: GSVR offers a fast, efficient, and high-quality video representation, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

TL;DR: Accordion is a framework converting AI-generated pixel designs into editable layered designs, refining nonsensical text and leveraging a vision language model (VLM) for decomposition and enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated designs lack editability, but inspire human designers. Accordion bridges this gap by transforming non-layered AI designs into editable layered ones.

Method: Uses a VLM in three stages with curated prompts, top-down decomposition, and vision experts like SAM. Trained on Design39K dataset with AI-generated images and refined ground truth.

Result: Accordion performs well on DesignIntention benchmark tasks (text-to-template, adding text, text de-rendering) and excels in design variations.

Conclusion: Accordion successfully converts AI designs into editable layered formats, enhancing usability and creativity in graphic design workflows.

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

*Yuyang Hu,Kangfu Mei,Mojtaba Sahraee-Ardakan,Ulugbek S. Kamilov,Peyman Milanfar,Mauricio Delbracio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kernel Density Steering (KDS) improves diffusion models for image restoration by using an ensemble of samples to guide outputs toward higher-fidelity regions, reducing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image restoration often produce inconsistent fidelity and artifacts, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: KDS employs an N-particle ensemble to compute patch-wise kernel density gradients, steering samples toward shared high-density regions for better fidelity.

Result: KDS enhances performance on super-resolution and inpainting tasks, yielding higher-quality outputs with improved quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Conclusion: KDS is a plug-and-play framework that boosts diffusion model performance without retraining, offering robust and high-fidelity image restoration.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GenHMC, a generative method to create synthetic HMC images from unpaired data, improving avatar animation accuracy and reducing reliance on paired captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in obtaining ground truth facial states for VR/AR avatars due to limited synchronized data from HMC and dome cameras, and imperfect disentanglement in prior methods.

Method: Uses large unpaired HMC captures to generate synthetic HMC images conditioned on avatar states from dome captures, disentangling expression and appearance.

Result: Achieves accurate ground truth, generalizes to unseen identities, and improves data efficiency and accuracy in face encoders.

Conclusion: GenHMC offers a scalable solution for photorealistic avatar animations by leveraging unpaired data and improving disentanglement.

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

*Suoxiang Zhang,Xiaxi Li,Hongrui Chang,Zhuoyan Hou,Guoxin Wu,Ronghua Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptaGen is a hierarchical semantic optimization framework for domain-specific image generation, addressing semantic and visual dependencies, reducing hallucinations, and improving quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods separate prompt engineering and model adaptation, ignore domain-specific semantic constraints, and produce hallucinations and semantic deviations.

Method: AdaptaGen integrates matrix-based prompt optimization, multi-perspective understanding, cross-modal adaptation, and two-phase caption semantic transformation.

Result: Superior performance in 40 categories with only 16 images per category, improving image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency.

Conclusion: AdaptaGen effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, ensuring high-quality, semantically accurate domain-specific image generation.

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Xuemeng Song,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OFFSET, a method for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) that addresses feature degradation and visual focus bias by using dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR methods ignore inhomogeneity in visual data and overlook textual data priority, leading to degraded query features and visual focus bias.

Method: Proposes OFFSET, featuring a focus mapping-based feature extractor (dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping) and a textually guided focus revision module.

Result: Superior performance on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating reduced noise interference and improved focus perception.

Conclusion: OFFSET effectively addresses CIR limitations, enhancing retrieval accuracy by focusing on dominant portions and leveraging textual guidance.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The

Motivation: Traditional real-valued diffusion models struggle with complex-valued phase information and fine structural details in PolSAR data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world PolSAR datasets, especially in edge preservation and region homogeneity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of traditional diffusion models for PolSAR data, improving classification accuracy and detail preservation.

domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

### [29] [Dynamic Rank Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05668)
*Jiahui Wang,Qin Xu,Bo Jiang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRA improves generalization in VLMs by dynamically adapting feature ranks based on token importance and preserving informative features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overfit on less informative features, degrading generalization for unseen classes.

Method: DRA uses token importance grouping, dynamic rank adaptation, and a channel response mechanism to prioritize informative features.

Result: DRA outperforms existing methods, especially in new class performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DRA effectively enhances generalization for unseen classes in VLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

### [30] [Modeling and Reversing Brain Lesions Using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05670)
*Omar Zamzam,Haleh Akrami,Anand Joshi,Richard Leahy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion model-based framework to segment brain lesions, reverse tissue deformations, and estimate pre-lesion healthy brain states, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lesion segmentation methods fail to distinguish between damaged and deformed brain tissue, limiting accuracy in analysis.

Method: A diffusion model segments lesions, reverses deformations to isolate core damage, and inpaints to estimate pre-lesion healthy brain. Synthetic data validates the reverse process.

Result: Improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis.

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-VLM improves GUI grounding accuracy by 13% using zoomed-in region proposals and an IoU-aware objective function, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with precise element grounding due to cluttered screens and suboptimal loss functions.

Method: Proposes R-VLM with zoomed-in region proposals and an IoU-aware objective for better localization.

Result: Achieves 13% higher grounding accuracy on benchmarks and 3.2-9.7% improvements in navigation tasks.

Conclusion: R-VLM bridges VLMs and object detection, enhancing GUI automation performance.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedVideoCap-55K, a large-scale dataset for medical video generation, and MedGen, a model achieving high performance in visual quality and medical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical video generation is underexplored despite its importance for clinical training and education, with current models lacking accuracy due to inadequate datasets.

Method: The authors create MedVideoCap-55K, a dataset of 55,000 curated medical clips, and develop MedGen, a model trained on this dataset.

Result: MedGen outperforms open-source models and competes with commercial systems in visual quality and medical accuracy.

Conclusion: The dataset and model aim to advance research in medical video generation, with code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

### [33] [Integrated Structural Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05677)
*Jiahui Wang,Qin Xu,Bo Jiang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve prompt learning by modeling structural relationships between prompts and tokens, and introduces a sample probing module for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for VLMs often ignore structural relationships between prompts and tokens and struggle with balancing performance across base and new classes.

Method: ISP includes self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model relationships within and across modalities, and a sample probing module to dynamically adjust loss coefficients.

Result: Experiments on base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization show ISP outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ISP enhances VLM performance by improving prompt interactions and generalization, achieving competitive results.

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

*Yisu Zhang,Chenjie Cao,Chaohui Yu,Jianke Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiON-LoRA improves video diffusion models by introducing linear scalability, orthogonality, and norm consistency for precise control over camera and object motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise control over camera trajectories and object motion in VDMs is challenging due to unstable fusion and non-linear scalability.

Method: LiON-LoRA uses orthogonality analysis, norm consistency, and a controllable token in DiT for decoupled control and linear scalability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control and motion strength adjustment with minimal training data.

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA provides superior generalization and controllability in video synthesis.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

*Mohsi Jawaid,Marcus Märtens,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors is introduced to improve spacecraft pose estimation under harsh lighting conditions, leveraging the strengths of both modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spacecraft pose estimation is critical for autonomous operations but is challenged by harsh lighting conditions that degrade RGB sensor performance. Event sensors, with higher dynamic range, offer resilience but have limitations like lower resolution and noise.

Method: A beam-splitter prism ensures precise alignment of RGB and event sensors. A RANSAC-based technique fuses data from both channels, complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to handle extreme conditions.

Result: The method was tested on a real dataset under challenging illumination, showing promising performance for spacecraft pose estimation.

Conclusion: The event-RGB fusion approach effectively addresses individual sensor limitations, supporting the use of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. The dataset will be released publicly to aid further research.

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Motivation: To address challenges in HAD (e.g., computational complexity, noise sensitivity) and provide a comprehensive comparison of existing methods to guide future research.

Method: Categorizes HAD techniques into statistical models, representation-based methods, classical machine learning, and deep learning. Evaluates them on 17 datasets using metrics like ROC, AUC, and separability maps.

Result: Deep learning models had the highest detection accuracy, while statistical models were the fastest.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for advancing HAD, recommending deep learning for accuracy and statistical models for speed.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SenseShift6D introduces a new RGB-D dataset for 6D object-pose estimation, exploring real-world variations in illumination and sensor settings, and demonstrates the benefits of test-time sensor control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack real-world variations in illumination and sensor settings, limiting the robustness of 6D pose estimation models. SenseShift6D addresses this gap by capturing diverse sensor-lighting permutations.

Method: The dataset includes 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images for three objects, covering 13 RGB exposures, 9 gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth modes, and 5 illumination levels. State-of-the-art models were tested with sensor control during inference.

Result: Test-time sensor control outperforms digital augmentation and matches or exceeds the benefits of increasing training data. Joint adaptation of RGB-D configurations yields the best performance.

Conclusion: SenseShift6D advances 6D-pose evaluation by emphasizing sensor-aware robustness, enabling adaptive perception systems for uncertain real-world environments.

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Motivation: Accurate color balance in microscope images is challenging; this work aims to automate and improve it.

Method: An automatic white balance mechanism was developed and tested on 200 microscopic images, including HPS and immunohistochemical stains.

Result: The algorithm proved more effective than traditional photography methods for microscopic images.

Conclusion: The proposed method is superior for balancing colors in stained microscopic images.

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D object generation lack focus on part decomposition and articulation, and rely on dense data, limiting scalability. DreamArt addresses these gaps.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: 1) part-segmented 3D mesh reconstruction, 2) articulation priors via a fine-tuned video diffusion model, and 3) motion optimization and texture refinement.

Result: DreamArt produces high-quality articulated objects with accurate part shapes, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation.

Conclusion: DreamArt offers a scalable solution for articulated asset generation, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Method: Leverages large language models to interpret user instructions and activate task-specific pipelines. Introduces an instruction-based local repainting model for automated edits.

Result: Achieves better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to current methods.

Conclusion: TalkFashion enhances flexibility and automation in virtual try-on, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text
instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods
primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large

execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of

enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the

*Xin Hu,Ke Qin,Guiduo Duan,Ming Li,Yuan-Fang Li,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE improves Panoptic Scene Graph Generation by addressing VLM limitations in spatial reasoning using a diffusion model and spatial-aware transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial relation reasoning, leading to poor relation prediction in PSG.

Method: SPADE uses inversion-guided calibration and spatial-aware context reasoning to enhance relation understanding.

Result: SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in spatial relationship prediction.

Conclusion: SPADE effectively addresses spatial reasoning limitations in PSG, improving performance in open- and closed-set scenarios.

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DREAM, an autoregressive model for end-to-end document reconstruction, addressing limitations of multi-stage and generative models by preserving layout information and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for document reconstruction suffer from error propagation in multi-stage approaches and lack layout preservation in generative models.

Method: Proposes DREAM, an autoregressive model that transforms text images into document sequences end-to-end, incorporating layout and element information. Introduces DSM and DocRec1K dataset for evaluation.

Result: DREAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in document reconstruction and performs competitively in subtasks like layout analysis and text recognition.

Conclusion: DREAM effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, offering a robust and versatile solution for document reconstruction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

Motivation: Real-world data acquisition for autonomous driving is costly and limited by safety and diversity constraints, prompting the need for synthetic data generation.

Result: Demonstrates accurate capture of lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent noise in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Solar altitude is an effective, label-free solution for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

*Wang Wang,Mingyu Shi,Jun Jiang,Wenqian Ma,Chong Liu,Yasutaka Narazaki,Xuguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating synthetic 3D bridge point clouds with annotations to improve real-world bridge inspection and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bridge inspection methods are inefficient, and real-world 3D data is often incomplete, limiting the potential of data-driven approaches.

Method: Proposes a systematic framework to generate complete and annotated 3D bridge point clouds, including simulating incomplete data for training segmentation and completion networks.

Result: A PointNet++ model trained with synthetic data achieves 84.2% mIoU in real-world segmentation, and KT-Net excels in component completion.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel methodology and dataset for 3D bridge analysis, enhancing automated infrastructure management.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

*Yuhuan Xie,Aoxuan Pan,Ming-Xian Lin,Wei Huang,Yi-Hua Huang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 2D-3D-2D framework improves 2D image editing by lifting objects into 3D for edits, ensuring consistency and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D generative models struggle with consistency and object identity due to pixel-level manipulations.

Method: Lifts 2D objects into 3D for edits in a rigidity-constrained environment, then reprojects and inpaints back into 2D.

Result: Outperforms methods like DragGAN and DragDiffusion in consistency and identity preservation.

Conclusion: The 2D-3D-2D framework offers superior performance for realistic and consistent image editing.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

*L'ea Dubois,Klaus Schmidt,Chengyu Wang,Ji-Hoon Park,Lin Wang,Santiago Munoz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combines Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance video understanding, enabling causal reasoning and future prediction through a sophisticated fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models lack commonsense world knowledge, limiting their ability to perform high-level cognitive tasks like reasoning and prediction.

Method: The framework fuses a VFM for visual perception with an LLM for reasoning, using a Q-Former-inspired fusion module to align visual features with language. Training involves large-scale alignment pre-training and targeted instruction fine-tuning.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance, excels in zero-shot generalization, and demonstrates the importance of each component through ablation studies.

Conclusion: This work advances machine perception from recognition to cognitive understanding, with potential applications in robotics and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

*Ourui Fu,Hangzhou He,Xinliang Zhang,Lei Zhu,Shuang Zeng,ZhaoHeng Xie,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces I²R, a novel few-shot segmentation method addressing inter- and intra-image discrepancies to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation and limitations of current few-shot segmentation methods due to semantic gaps and visually similar regions.

Method: Proposes I²R with category-specific high-level representations for precise inter-image localization and a directional masking strategy to suppress inconsistent pixel pairs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.9% and 2.1% mIoU improvements on PASCAL-5ⁱ and COCO-20ⁱ benchmarks.

Conclusion: I²R effectively addresses key limitations in few-shot segmentation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

*Yue Peng,Bing Xiong,Fuqiang Chen,De Eybo,RanRan Zhang,Wanming Hu,Jing Cai,Wenjian Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes USIGAN, a method for IHC virtual staining that addresses challenges of weak pairing and spatial heterogeneity, improving consistency and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of generating virtual IHC images from H&E images faces challenges due to weak pairing and spatial heterogeneity, leading to inaccurate mappings and inconsistent results.

Method: USIGAN uses unbalanced self-information feature transport, UOT-CTM, and PC-SCM mechanisms to improve consistency without relying on positional correspondence.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in clinically significant metrics like IoD and Pearson-R correlation.

Conclusion: USIGAN effectively mitigates weak pairing issues, enhancing content and pathological semantic consistency in virtual IHC staining.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote sensing-based crop yield prediction struggle with limited spatial modeling and weak generalization across crop types and years.

Method: DFYP includes three components: Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA), Adaptive Operator Learning Network (AOL-Net), and a dual-branch architecture with learnable fusion.

Result: DFYP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different resolutions, crop types, and time periods.

Conclusion: DFYP is effective and robust for real-world agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

TL;DR: D-FCGS introduces a feedforward framework for compressing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting sequences, achieving high compression rates and preserving visual quality without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient compression of dynamic 3D representations for free-viewpoint video (FVV) is challenging, and existing methods lack generalizability due to optimization-dependent coding.

Method: Uses a Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, motion extraction via sparse control points, and a dual prior-aware entropy model for compression. Reconstruction involves motion compensation and a refinement network.

Result: Achieves over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds, matching optimization-based methods in rate-distortion performance while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: D-FCGS advances feedforward compression for dynamic 3DGS, enabling scalable FVV transmission and storage for immersive applications.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

*Xianzhi Ma,Jianhui Li,Changhua Pei,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMag is a new framework for remote sensing image understanding, addressing limitations of existing RS-VLMs by dynamically adjusting attention and resolution for multi-granularity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS-VLMs struggle with pixel-level tasks, small-object recognition, and high computational costs for high-resolution images.

Method: GeoMag uses Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC) to focus on relevant regions and reduce redundancy.

Result: GeoMag outperforms existing RS-VLMs in pixel-level tasks and maintains competitive performance across other granularities.

Conclusion: GeoMag is a versatile and efficient solution for multi-granularity remote sensing image parsing.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking, addressing performance degradation in existing trackers due to temporally incomplete multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal data enhances visual tracking but suffers from sensor synchronization issues, leading to incomplete data. Existing trackers lack adaptability to handle missing modalities.

Method: Proposes a Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity and a video-level masking strategy for temporal and spatial consistency.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 benchmarks, adapting to missing data rates and scene complexity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles incomplete multimodal data, outperforming existing trackers in both complete and missing modality settings.

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code
and benchmark will be publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the suitability of explainable AI (xAI) methods and metrics for remote sensing (RS) scene classification, identifying limitations and providing guidelines for their use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most xAI methods and metrics are designed for natural images, not RS, leading to potential unsuitability. This paper investigates their effectiveness in RS.

Method: Analyzes ten explanation metrics across five categories, applied to five feature attribution methods on three RS datasets.

Result: Identifies limitations in methods (e.g., perturbation-based and gradient-based approaches) and metrics (e.g., faithfulness, localization). Robustness and randomization metrics are more stable.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for selecting xAI methods and metrics in RS scene classification, emphasizing stable and reliable options.

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGPO is an RL framework for LMMs to iteratively focus on key image regions via multi-turn grounding, outperforming SFT and other models on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with high-resolution images due to irrelevant visual tokens, requiring costly annotations for grounding.

Method: MGPO uses RL to crop sub-images based on predicted grounding coordinates in a multi-turn conversation, with a binary reward for answer correctness.

Result: MGPO improves performance by 5.4% on MME-Realworld and 5.2% on V* Bench, surpassing OpenAI models.

Conclusion: MGPO enables robust grounding in LMMs without extra annotations, demonstrating strong performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric awareness via monocular depth estimation to improve Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) robustness, testing three integration methods (EDC, SV, DS). EDC and SV show significant improvements, with EDC achieving a state-of-the-art 56.2 AP on OVIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VIS struggles with occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations. The work aims to enhance robustness by incorporating depth cues.

Method: Three paradigms are tested: EDC (depth map as input), SV (shared ViT backbone), and DS (depth as auxiliary supervision).

Result: EDC and SV outperform DS, with EDC achieving 56.2 AP on OVIS, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: Depth cues are critical for robust VIS, with EDC and SV proving effective.

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sparse representation method for neural surface reconstruction improves memory efficiency and enables higher resolution reconstructions compared to dense 3D feature volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense 3D feature volumes limit reconstruction quality due to poor scalability with increasing voxel resolutions.

Method: A two-stage approach: predict voxel occupancies from images and depth maps, then compute features and render only in high-occupancy voxels. Custom algorithms handle sparse volumes efficiently.

Result: Reduces storage by 50x, enables 512³ resolution (vs. 128³), and achieves superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The sparse representation method significantly enhances reconstruction quality and efficiency, outperforming existing dense-volume approaches.

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To advance video generation by enabling simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion, addressing misalignment in multimodal conditioning.

Method: Introduces a decoupled personalization extractor, gated self-attention for multimodal integration, and a contrastive loss for joint optimization.

Result: Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, offering advanced motion control and multi-entity customization.

Conclusion: Tora2 marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation, setting a new benchmark for customization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

*Vera Soboleva,Aibek Alanov,Andrey Kuznetsov,Konstantin Sobolev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-LoRA introduces a timestep-dependent low-rank adaptation framework for fine-tuning diffusion models with limited data, addressing overfitting and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in diffusion model fine-tuning with limited samples compromises generalization and diversity, especially for single-image customization.

Method: T-LoRA uses a dynamic fine-tuning strategy and orthogonal weight parametrization to adapt models based on diffusion timesteps.

Result: T-LoRA outperforms standard LoRA and other techniques, balancing concept fidelity and text alignment effectively.

Conclusion: T-LoRA is a promising solution for data-limited scenarios, enhancing diffusion model personalization.

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

*Haiwen Li,Delong Liu,Zhaohui Hou,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation in Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) and introduces a synthetic dataset (CIRHS) and a novel framework (CoAlign) for robust zero-shot and supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods rely on costly manual triplet labeling, limiting scalability and zero-shot capability. The goal is to overcome this by automating triplet generation and improving retrieval performance.

Method: A pipeline uses a large language model (LLM) to generate prompts for a text-to-image model, creating image pairs for the CIRHS dataset. The CoAlign framework combines global alignment and local reasoning for robust representations.

Result: CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on benchmarks and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised CIR methods, demonstrating the feasibility of synthetic dataset training.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline and framework effectively address scalability and performance challenges in CIR, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

*Xin Wu,Fei Teng,Yue Feng,Kaibo Shi,Zhuosheng Lin,Ji Zhang,James Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCINet is a novel framework for partial multi-label learning, leveraging co-occurrence patterns and multimodal alignment to improve label-instance relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurately identifying ambiguous label-instance relationships in incompletely annotated data.

Method: Proposes SCINet with a bi-dominant prompter module, cross-modality fusion, and intrinsic semantic augmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SCINet effectively enhances partial multi-label learning by improving semantic alignment and label confidence.

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

*Haroon Wahab,Hassan Ugail,Lujain Jaleel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble-based deepfake detection improves generalization across diverse datasets compared to single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance deterioration of deepfake detection models on out-of-distribution data.

Method: Combine prediction probabilities from state-of-the-art asymmetric models into an ensemble.

Result: Ensemble predictions outperform single models in stability and reliability across out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Asymmetric ensembling is a robust solution for real-world deepfake detection.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive
results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates
significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of
deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent
open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several
state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span
two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery
type or quality is often unavailable.

### [62] [Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05999)
*Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Atif Mansoor,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for geo-registering LiDAR point clouds in GNSS-denied urban areas by aligning them with satellite images, using road segmentation and intersection points for global and local alignment, with elevation correction from SRTM data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geo-registration methods rely on GNSS and IMU data, which fail in dense urban areas. The paper aims to address this by proposing a method that does not depend on prior localization.

Method: Uses a Point Transformer model to segment roads, extracts road skeletons and intersection points for alignment, performs global rigid alignment, local refinement with RBF interpolation, and elevation correction using SRTM data.

Result: Achieved 55.3% improvement on KITTI dataset (0.84m STD) and 77.4% on Perth dataset (0.96m STD), with elevation correlation gains of 30.5% and 50.4%, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves geo-registration accuracy in GNSS-denied urban areas without relying on prior localization.

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

*Syeda Anshrah Gillani,Mirza Samad Ahmed Baig,Osama Ahmed Khan,Shahid Munir Shah,Umema Mujeeb,Maheen Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCDA introduces a framework for text-to-image diffusion models to generate readable and correctly spelled text in images, addressing a key limitation of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with rendering readable and meaningful text, limiting practical applications like advertising and design.

Method: GCDA extends diffusion models with a dual-stream text encoder, character-aware attention, and OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning.

Result: GCDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in text rendering (lower error rates) and maintains high image quality (FID: 14.3).

Conclusion: GCDA effectively bridges the gap in text rendering for diffusion models, enabling broader practical use.

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

*Alexandre Symeonidis-Herzig,Özge Mercanoğlu Sincan,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSpeaker improves 3D facial animations using photorealistic rendering and a perceptual lip-reading loss, outperforming prior methods by 56.1% in Lip Vertex Error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity 3D facial animations are needed for expressive avatars, but existing mesh-based methods lag behind 2D innovations.

Method: Uses photorealistic differentiable rendering supervised by visual speech recognition, with a perceptual lip-reading loss from 3D Gaussian Splatting avatar renders.

Result: Achieves 56.1% improvement in Lip Vertex Error and better perceptual quality on the MEAD dataset.

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker enhances animation quality and controllability, supporting accurate mouthings for sign language avatars.

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

*Chang Liu,Ye Pan,Chenyang Ding,Susanto Rahardja,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEDTalk is a framework for dynamic emotional 3D facial animation, disentangling content and emotion for realistic expressions using multimodal inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on static emotion labels, limiting diversity and naturalness in facial animations.

Method: Disentangles content and emotion via cross-reconstruction, integrates audio and text for dynamic expressions, and uses multimodal inputs for control.

Result: Generates fine-grained, dynamic emotional expressions suitable for industrial pipelines like MetaHuman.

Conclusion: MEDTalk advances emotional facial animation by enabling independent control and realistic expressions.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

*Tongtong Cheng,Rongzhen Li,Yixin Xiong,Tao Zhang,Jing Wang,Kai Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAM is a novel model for driving behavior recognition, addressing spurious correlations and ego-vehicle causality with multimodal causal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack deep causal analysis and ignore ego-vehicle causality, limiting accurate driving behavior recognition.

Method: MCAM uses a multi-level feature extractor, a causal analysis module with DAGs, and a vision-language transformer for alignment.

Result: MCAM achieves SOTA performance on BDD-X and CoVLA datasets, excelling in causal relationship learning.

Conclusion: MCAM effectively captures causal characteristics in driving scenarios, proving valuable for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

*Francesco Milano,Manuel López-Antequera,Naina Dhingra,Roland Siegwart,Robert Thiel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for 3D surface recovery from normal maps, handling discontinuities and generic central cameras, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal integration methods struggle with depth discontinuities and limited camera models, prompting a need for a more versatile solution.

Method: Uses a local planarity assumption with constraints between surface normals and ray directions to model discontinuities and handle generic central cameras.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks and is the first to support generic central camera models.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances normal integration by explicitly addressing discontinuities and expanding camera model compatibility.

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

*Chihan Huang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAST-Phys, a novel dataset for remote multi-modal emotion recognition, addressing the lack of non-contact affective datasets and demonstrating the importance of physiological signals alongside facial cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of non-contact affective datasets and the influence of contact-based devices on genuine emotional responses motivate the creation of CAST-Phys for remote physiological emotion recognition.

Method: The authors present CAST-Phys, a dataset with diverse physiological signals (PPG, EDA, RR) and high-resolution facial videos, enabling remote signal recovery. They evaluate individual and fused modalities for emotion recognition.

Result: The dataset and analysis highlight the importance of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions alone are insufficient, showcasing the effectiveness of multi-modal remote emotion recognition.

Conclusion: CAST-Phys advances contactless emotion recognition by providing a high-quality dataset and demonstrating the potential of remote multi-modal approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

*Jiayi Song,Zihan Ye,Qingyuan Zhou,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Jingyi Xu,Ying He,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ref-Unlock is a geometry-aware reflection modeling framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting to disentangle reflections and improve scene rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS misinterpret reflections as geometry, causing degraded reconstructions.

Method: Uses dual-branch representation with spherical harmonics, reflection removal, pseudo-depth maps, and geometry-aware constraints.

Result: Outperforms GS-based methods and competes with NeRF models, enabling reflection editing.

Conclusion: Ref-Unlock provides an efficient, generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes.

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models focus on images, leaving a gap in unified video understanding and generation. Omni-Video aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses MLLMs to generate visual clues for diffusion decoders, with a lightweight architecture and multi-stage training.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization across video tasks like generation, editing, and understanding.

Conclusion: Omni-Video efficiently unifies video tasks, showing promise for future video modeling.

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

*Haoyu Wang,Lei Zhang,Wei Wei,Chen Ding,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prompt-free conditional diffusion framework is proposed for multi-object image augmentation, addressing deviations and diversity issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-object image generation either deviate from original data due to text reliance or lack diversity due to over-reliance on original images.

Method: Introduces a local-global semantic fusion strategy and LoRA for knowledge injection, along with a reward model-based counting loss for training.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, with strong downstream task gains and out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates deviations and enhances diversity in multi-object image augmentation.

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%),
outperforming all other functions tested. These findings demonstrate that
SoftReMish offers better convergence behavior and generalization capability,
making it a promising candidate for visual recognition tasks.

### [75] [Normalizing Diffusion Kernels with Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06161)
*Nathan Kessler,Robin Magnet,Jean Feydy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generalize Laplacian-based smoothing for irregular data using similarity matrices and a symmetric Sinkhorn algorithm, retaining Laplacian-like properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Laplacian smoothing requires structured domains, which are often unavailable. Simple alternatives like convolution kernels are biased. The goal is to extend Laplacian benefits to irregular data.

Method: Proposes a class of smoothing operators from similarity/adjacency matrices, normalized via a symmetric Sinkhorn algorithm to mimic heat diffusion.

Result: The operators approximate heat diffusion and retain spectral properties of Laplacians, applicable to irregular data like point clouds.

Conclusion: The method bridges the gap between structured and irregular domains, enabling Laplacian-like smoothing and processing for diverse data types.

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniPart is a framework for part-aware 3D object generation, enabling high semantic decoupling and structural cohesion through a two-stage process: structure planning and part synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods produce monolithic 3D shapes, limiting utility for interactive applications requiring editable part structures.

Method: OmniPart uses an autoregressive structure planning module for part layout and a rectified flow model for part synthesis, leveraging 2D part masks for intuitive control.

Result: OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting user-defined part granularity and precise localization.

Conclusion: The framework advances interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content generation.

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D
content.

*Prahitha Movva,Naga Harshita Marupaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in visual question answering (VQA) for scientific data, proposing an approach for the SciVQA 2025 task using large models and ensemble techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods lack precision in interpreting scientific figures, especially for numerical values and multi-step reasoning.

Method: Experiments with 5B-8B parameter models, including InternVL3, and ensemble VLMs, using prompt optimization and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: InternVL3 achieved ROUGE-1/L F1 of 0.740 and BERTScore 0.983; ensemble models improved performance but InternVL3 was the strongest standalone.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble modeling enhance VQA performance for scientific data.

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

*Yuchen Huang,Zhiyuan Fan,Zhitao He,Sandeep Polisetty,Wenyan Li,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CultureCLIP, a fine-tuned version of CLIP, to address its limitations in distinguishing culturally distinct but visually similar concepts. It uses a synthetic dataset, CulTwin, and customized contrastive learning to improve fine-grained cultural differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP struggle with fine-grained cultural distinctions due to lack of culture-specific datasets and contextual knowledge.

Method: A data curation pipeline creates CulTwin, a synthetic dataset of concept-caption-image triplets. CLIP is fine-tuned on CulTwin using contrastive learning to create CultureCLIP.

Result: CultureCLIP outperforms CLIP by up to 5.49% in fine-grained cultural recognition while maintaining generalization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures subtle cultural distinctions, validating the data synthesis and training paradigm.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

*Aleksandar Jevtić,Christoph Reich,Felix Wimbauer,Oliver Hahn,Christian Rupprecht,Stefan Roth,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneDINO introduces an unsupervised method for semantic scene completion (SSC) using self-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results without ground-truth annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior SSC methods rely on costly ground-truth annotations; SceneDINO aims to eliminate this dependency by leveraging self-supervised learning.

Method: SceneDINO adapts self-supervised techniques and 2D unsupervised scene understanding to SSC, using multi-view consistency self-supervision and a novel 3D feature distillation approach.

Result: SceneDINO achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy in unsupervised 3D and 2D scene understanding, matching supervised SSC performance via linear probing.

Conclusion: SceneDINO demonstrates strong potential as a foundation for single-image 3D scene understanding, with domain generalization and multi-view consistency.

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

### [80] [RSRefSeg 2: Decoupling Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06231)
*Keyan Chen,Chenyang Liu,Bowen Chen,Jiafan Zhang,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSRefSeg 2 introduces a decoupling paradigm for remote sensing image segmentation, improving accuracy and semantic interpretation by separating coarse localization and fine segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with complex semantic relationships and cross-modal alignment due to coupled processing, limiting generalizability and interpretability.

Method: RSRefSeg 2 uses a dual-stage framework: CLIP for coarse localization and SAM for fine segmentation, enhanced by a cascaded second-order prompter.

Result: Outperforms contemporary methods by ~3% gIoU in segmentation accuracy and handles complex semantics better.

Conclusion: The decoupling approach and foundation model collaboration in RSRefSeg 2 significantly advance remote sensing image segmentation.

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

TL;DR: AnthroTAP automates pseudo-labeled training data generation for point tracking using the SMPL model, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data and compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion is complex and rich for point tracking but manual annotation is laborious. AnthroTAP addresses this by automating data generation.

Method: The pipeline fits SMPL to video frames, projects 3D vertices to 2D, handles occlusions with ray-casting, and filters tracks using optical flow.

Result: AnthroTAP-trained models outperform others on TAP-Vid benchmark, using 10,000x less data and 1 day on 4 GPUs vs. 256 GPUs.

Conclusion: AnthroTAP provides an efficient, scalable solution for point tracking training data, reducing reliance on manual annotation.

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Connect-Four being solved mathematically, a strong solution via a look-up table was considered infeasible. The paper revisits this challenge.

Method: Uses binary decision diagrams for symbolic search to generate a look-up table, supplemented with alpha-beta search for optimal moves.

Result: Produced an 89.6 GB look-up table for the standard $7 \times 6$ board in 47 hours, including win-draw-loss evaluation and alpha-beta search.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of strong solutions via symbolic search, offering an open-source tool for Connect-Four analysis.

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move
can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the
form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we
revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce
strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a
89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main
memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this
win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source
artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT uses LLMs to convert semi-structured traffic signal control descriptions into exact SPaT results, achieving over 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the tedious manual process of creating and updating traffic signal control plans.

Method: Leverages LLMs to understand descriptions, reformulate plans as JSON, and uses Python scripts to assemble complete plans.

Result: Achieves over 94% accuracy in generating plans from descriptions in English and Chinese.

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT offers an easy-to-use, accurate solution for traffic signal plan management, enhancing LLM applications in ITS.

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance legal rule modeling with nuanced representations of obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies, addressing gaps in existing models like LegalRuleML.

Method: Introduces spatial, temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs in OLG++. Demonstrates expressiveness via food business regulations and property graph queries.

Result: OLG++ outperforms prior graph-based models, offering native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints, and reified exceptions.

Conclusion: OLG++ is more expressive and effective for legal knowledge representation than existing approaches.

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

Result: Collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on three agents, demonstrating the platform's utility.

Conclusion: The platform provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving deep research agents.

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at

Motivation: To explore VLMs' potential in AR training and address gaps in fine-grained vision-language alignment, especially for blind and visually impaired users.

Method: Created a dataset for AR training, systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluated nine state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o.

Result: Advanced VLMs struggle with fine-grained tasks (max F1 score: 40.54%), revealing the need for improved datasets and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for better vision-language alignment in VLMs for AR training and broader social benefits, providing open resources for the community.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine

including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source

TL;DR: The paper describes a multimodal approach for dermatology question answering, combining fine-tuned models, structured reasoning, and agentic RAG, achieving competitive results in the ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of accurate and interpretable diagnostic decisions in telemedicine, especially with limited input, by emulating dermatologists' reasoning patterns.

Method: Combines fine-tuned multimodal models (Qwen, Gemma, LLaMA), structured reasoning for adjudicating outputs, and agentic RAG to enhance context from a dermatology database.

Result: Achieved second place in the competition, demonstrating high accuracy and competitive performance.

Conclusion: The approach provides a reliable pathway for automated diagnostic support in dermatology, addressing practical telemedicine challenges.

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

### [91] [Red Teaming AI Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05538)
*Subhabrata Majumdar,Brian Pendleton,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI red teaming for focusing narrowly on model flaws, proposes a two-level framework (macro and micro) for broader systemic analysis, and emphasizes multifunctional teams to address emergent risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the gap between AI red teaming's original intent as a critical exercise and its narrow focus on model-level flaws in generative AI, overlooking broader sociotechnical systems.

Method: Proposes a comprehensive framework with macro-level (system-wide) and micro-level (model-specific) red teaming, informed by cybersecurity and systems theory.

Result: Identifies the need for multifunctional teams to examine emergent risks, systemic vulnerabilities, and sociotechnical interactions in AI systems.

Conclusion: Effective AI red teaming requires a broader, systemic approach beyond model-level flaws, integrating technical and social factors.

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o-mini for generating counterfactual explanations (CFs) in zero-shot and three-shot settings, outperforming traditional methods in plausibility, validity, and sparsity, while also improving downstream classifier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating human-centric CFs to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and physiological prediction tasks.

Method: Uses GPT-4o-mini for CF generation in zero-shot and three-shot settings, evaluated on stress prediction and heart disease detection datasets.

Result: Achieves high plausibility (99%), strong validity (0.99), and competitive sparsity. Augmented CFs improve classifier accuracy by 5%.

Conclusion: Prompt-based generative techniques with LLMs show promise for improving explainability and robustness in prediction tasks.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA reformulates low-rank adaptation by decomposing the weight update into a single low-rank matrix, eliminating scale conflicts and reducing parameters. It outperforms LoRA and LoRA+ in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unstable training dynamics and suboptimal performance caused by scale disparities in LoRA's two-matrix approach.

Method: SingLoRA learns weight updates as a decomposition of a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose, ensuring stable optimization and halving parameters.

Result: Achieves 91.3% accuracy on MNLI (vs. 89.1% for LoRA) and improves image fidelity in Stable Diffusion (DINO score 0.151 vs. 0.143 for LoRA).

Conclusion: SingLoRA offers a more stable and parameter-efficient alternative to LoRA, validated by superior performance in NLP and image tasks.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize AI measurement for better comparisons, risk analysis, and understanding of how measurement defines AI capabilities.

Method: Introduces a layered measurement stack, distinguishes direct from indirect observables, and outlines a unified taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Result: Provides a framework for a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI capabilities and evaluations.

Conclusion: Formalizing AI measurement can enhance research, practice, and regulation by clarifying comparisons and risk assessments.

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of
artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will
allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes MLlm-DR, a multimodal LLM for explainable depression diagnosis, integrating a smaller LLM and LQ-former for multimodal data processing, achieving top results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of explainability in automated depression diagnosis and poor performance of current LLMs on interview data.

Method: Uses a smaller LLM for score/rationale generation and LQ-former for multimodal feature extraction, trained on a robust dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ datasets.

Conclusion: MLlm-DR effectively combines explainability and performance for depression diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Result: Geotechnical-adapted LLMs are applied in geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, design calculations, and more, with identified benefits and limitations.

Conclusion: The survey provides a foundation for practitioners and researchers to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice and future studies.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic

*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,Yanbo J. Wang,En Zhu,Xuan Yang,Yiduo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ADMC uses an Attention-based Diffusion model to complete missing multimodal features, improving emotion and intent recognition without over-coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of missing modalities in multimodal emotion/intent recognition, where traditional methods suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation.

Method: Independent feature extraction for each modality and an Attention-based Diffusion Network (ADN) to generate missing features aligned with authentic distributions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks in both missing and full-modality scenarios.

Conclusion: ADMC effectively handles missing modalities and enhances recognition, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

*Yuan An,John Liu,Niyam Acharya,Ruhma Hashmi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-generated retrieval practice questions improved student knowledge retention (89% vs. 73%) but require manual verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating retrieval practice question generation to save instructor time while maintaining learning effectiveness.

Method: Empirical study in two college data science courses comparing weeks with and without LLM-generated retrieval practice.

Result: Students with LLM-generated questions achieved 89% accuracy vs. 73% without.

Conclusion: LLM-generated questions are effective but need manual review for quality.

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

TL;DR: The paper addresses misinformation spread on social media using LLMs, identifies gaps in simulating human behavior, and proposes SIP-CoT with emotion-guided memory to enhance realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of social media and AI-driven misinformation necessitates better models for understanding and controlling information spread, as traditional methods fall short.

Method: The authors introduce an LLM-based simulation environment and propose SIP-CoT, a mechanism enhanced by emotion-guided memory, to improve social cue interpretation and behavioral realism.

Result: Experiments show SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents better mimic human behaviors, attitudes, and emotions, addressing gaps in stance detection and psychological realism.

Conclusion: The research underscores LLM limitations in simulating human dynamics and demonstrates SIP-CoT's effectiveness in enhancing social intelligence and realism.

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

*Tianxing Wu,Lizhe Cao,Shuang Wang,Jiming Wang,Shutong Zhu,Yerong Wu,Yuqing Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data (TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction, leveraging judicial performance data to improve reliability over traditional economic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FDI predictions rely on economic data like GDP, which can be manipulated. Judicial data offers a more reliable alternative by reflecting investment security and returns.

Method: The authors build an index system from adjudication documents, create a tabular dataset, and develop TLJD to encode judicial performance indicators using a mixture of experts model.

Result: TLJD outperforms ten baselines, achieving at least 0.92 R2 in cross-city and cross-time FDI prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Judicial data enhances FDI prediction reliability, and TLJD provides a robust method for city-level analysis.

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

*Dipayan Sengupta,Saumya Panda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares AI and human-generated dermatology treatment plans, revealing a significant 'evaluator effect' where humans favor peer plans while an AI judge prefers AI-generated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality and perception of AI-generated treatment plans compared to human experts, highlighting the evaluator's role in judging clinical plans.

Method: Ten dermatologists, GPT-4o, and reasoning AI (o3) created treatment plans for five cases, evaluated by peers and a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro).

Result: Humans scored peer plans higher, while the AI judge favored AI plans, with the reasoning AI (o3) ranked highest by the AI but lowest by humans.

Conclusion: The evaluator's nature dictates plan quality perception, revealing a gap between human heuristics and AI logic, necessitating synergistic human-AI systems for clinical integration.

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

### [102] [An autonomous agent for auditing and improving the reliability of clinical AI models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05755)
*Lukas Kuhn,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ModelAuditor is a tool for auditing AI models in clinical settings, identifying failure modes due to real-world variations, and providing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models in clinical practice often fail under real-world variations, lacking tools for reliable auditing and mitigation.

Method: ModelAuditor uses a self-reflective agent to simulate shifts, generate reports, and recommend fixes.

Result: It identifies failure modes, recovers 15-25% lost performance, and operates cheaply and quickly.

Conclusion: ModelAuditor effectively improves AI model reliability in clinical deployment.

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method for real-time battery SoH monitoring in microgrids uses discharge pulse analysis at the end of charge, achieving accurate predictions with high explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SoH monitoring methods are limited in microgrids due to operational constraints, necessitating an innovative approach.

Method: Analyzes a discharge pulse post-charge, using parameters from an equivalent electrical model to estimate SoH.

Result: Predicted battery degradation with ~1% mean absolute error and 0.9 explainability score, validated on experimental data.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for integration into BMS, enabling optimized battery management in continuous operation.

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTA1, a GUI agent addressing ambiguity in task planning and visual grounding challenges using test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve GUI agent performance by resolving ambiguity in task planning and enhancing visual grounding accuracy.

Method: Uses test-time scaling for action proposal selection and a reinforcement learning-based model for precise visual grounding.

Result: Achieves high accuracies (e.g., 50.1% on Screenspot-Pro) and state-of-the-art task success rates (e.g., 45.2% on OSWorld).

Conclusion: GTA1 effectively addresses key challenges in GUI agents, demonstrating superior performance and open-sourcing the solution.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

### [105] [Affective-ROPTester: Capability and Bias Analysis of LLMs in Predicting Retinopathy of Prematurity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05816)
*Shuai Zhao,Yulin Zhang,Luwei Xiao,Xinyi Wu,Yanhao Jia,Zhongliang Guo,Xiaobao Wu,Cong-Duy Nguyen,Guoming Zhang,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CROP, a Chinese dataset for ROP risk prediction, and Affective-ROPTester, a framework to evaluate LLMs' predictive capabilities and affective biases in ROP risk stratification. Results show LLMs improve with external knowledge and are influenced by emotional framing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' unexplored capacity in predicting ROP risk and investigate affective biases in their predictions.

Method: Proposed Affective-ROPTester framework with three prompting strategies (Instruction-based, CoT, ICL) and emotional elements to assess LLMs' performance and biases.

Result: LLMs perform poorly with intrinsic knowledge but improve with external inputs. Affective biases exist, with positive framing reducing bias.

Conclusion: Affect-sensitive prompt engineering is crucial for reliable ROP risk prediction, and Affective-ROPTester effectively evaluates and mitigates affective biases in clinical LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

*Aloïs Rautureau,Éric Piette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques AI's lack of human-like cognition in games, reviews cognitive psychology insights, and introduces CogniPlay, a model aiming to replicate human decision-making in General Game Playing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems excel in games but lack human-like intuitive decision-making, prompting the need for models that better mimic human cognition.

Method: The paper reviews cognitive psychology and prior AI models, then proposes CogniPlay, a work-in-progress model for human-like behavior in GGP.

Result: CogniPlay is introduced as a potential solution to bridge the gap between AI performance and human-like cognition in games.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the gap in AI's human-like cognition and proposes CogniPlay as a step toward more intuitive, human-like decision-making in games.

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled model for combining symbolic algorithms and LLMs in automated reasoning tools, aiming to enhance scalability and retain strong guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neurosymbolic AR systems lack strong guarantees and deep synchronization between neural and symbolic components, limiting their potential.

Method: Introduces Neurosymbolic Transition Systems, pairing symbolic state with intuition and enabling parallel transitions over symbols and intuition.

Result: The proposed model promises to scale logical reasoning while maintaining symbolic guarantees, with potential implementation in a logic programming language.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic Transition Systems offer a principled foundation for building more effective neurosymbolic AR tools.

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decomposed approach to time series forecasting using Transformers, focusing on sequence representation, memory construction, and target projection, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting is challenging due to diverse tasks requiring unique solutions for sequence representation, information extraction, and projection.

Method: Decomposes forecasting into three stages: input sequence representation, information extraction/memory construction, and target projection, testing various modules like convolutional layers and self-attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and computational efficiency across seven benchmark datasets, with reduced training/inference times and fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The decomposed approach effectively addresses task-specific challenges in time series forecasting, offering high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MusiScene, a model for Music Scene Imagination (MSI), which generates scene descriptions for music by leveraging cross-modal video-audio data. It outperforms MU-LLaMA and enhances Video Background Music Generation (VBMG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI to imagine scenes from music, similar to humans, by combining video and audio data, improving upon music-only captioning models.

Method: Construct a dataset of 3,371 video-audio pairs, finetune Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA) for MSI to create MusiScene, and evaluate its performance.

Result: MusiScene generates more contextually relevant captions than MU-LLaMA and improves VBMG.

Conclusion: MusiScene successfully bridges music and scene imagination, enhancing cross-modal AI applications like VBMG.

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from
text.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BlueLM-2.5-3B is a compact 3B-scale Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for edge-device deployment, offering strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities with explicit control over thinking tokens. It outperforms or matches larger models in multimodal and text-only benchmarks while using less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance high-performance, on-device MLLMs by creating a compact yet powerful model with efficient training and deployment capabilities.

Method: Developed through diversified data curation, key data resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and high-performance training infrastructure.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to larger models (e.g., Qwen3-4B, Kimi-VL-A3B-16B) in text and multimodal benchmarks, with superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B demonstrates the feasibility of high-performance, compact MLLMs for edge devices, contributing insights to the research community.

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

*Yucheng Sheng,Jiacheng Wang,Xingyu Zhou,Le Liang,Hao Ye,Shi Jin,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks is proposed, improving generalization and zero-shot performance over traditional deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of mobile networks requires accurate prediction of key parameters, but traditional DL methods struggle with generalization across scenarios and tasks.

Method: The model uses univariate decomposition, granularity encoding, a causal Transformer, and patch masking for arbitrary input lengths.

Result: The model generalizes well to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot performance surpassing traditional baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model effectively addresses the limitations of traditional DL methods in wireless network predictions.

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

TL;DR: An attribution-based method improves interpretability of AI predictions for lymphedema risk in breast cancer patients using statistical analysis of rule-based model attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency in AI techniques hinders their interpretability and acceptance in healthcare, especially for lymphedema risk assessment.

Method: Statistical analysis of rule-based model attributes using Information Retrieval metrics to compute attribute relevance and provide interpretable risk factor impact.

Result: User study showed higher interpretability and usefulness of the proposed approach compared to raw AI model output.

Conclusion: The attribution-based method enhances interpretability of AI predictions for lymphedema risk, aiding healthcare decision-making.

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

TL;DR: HopeBot, an LLM-powered chatbot, effectively administers the PHQ-9 for depression screening, showing strong agreement with self-administered versions and high user trust and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static tools like PHQ-9 lack interactivity and adaptability, prompting the development of HopeBot to enhance user experience and scalability in depression screening.

Method: HopeBot uses retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification to administer PHQ-9. A within-subject study with 132 adults compared self-administered and chatbot versions.

Result: Scores showed strong agreement (ICC = 0.91). 71% of participants trusted the chatbot more, citing clearer structure and supportive tone. Mean comfort rating was 8.4/10, with 87.1% willing to reuse or recommend HopeBot.

Conclusion: Voice-based LLM chatbots like HopeBot are feasible, scalable, and low-burden adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning framework, achieves state-of-the-art SQL generation accuracy with minimal supervision and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Text-to-SQL translation, especially for complex queries, remains challenging despite advances in large language models.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with lightweight rewards based on execution correctness and format compliance, avoiding intermediate supervision.

Result: Outperforms larger models on benchmarks like BIRD, achieving high accuracy with a smaller 7B backbone and fewer GPUs.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach is scalable and efficient, advancing execution-aligned SQL generation with released datasets for further research.

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods often fail to provide clear outputs for non-experts, limiting their practical utility.

Method: FGNS uses local and global feature importance to select neighbors, focusing on class characteristics rather than just feature-space distance.

Result: FGNS outperformed k-NN in user studies, improving decision speed and accuracy for non-experts in Kannada script classification.

Conclusion: FGNS enhances interpretability and aligns better with human assessment, though further work is needed to bridge the trust gap.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of Lockean belief sets not being closed under classical logic deduction. It provides characterizations for such closed belief sets and proposes a minimal revision approach for probabilistic updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of Lockean belief sets, particularly their lack of closure under classical logic deduction, which complicates their use in belief change theory.

Method: The paper offers two characterizations of belief sets closed under classical logic deduction and introduces a probabilistic update method for minimal belief revision.

Result: The results include characterizations of closed belief sets and a method for minimally revising beliefs to accommodate new information while maintaining deductive closure.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by demonstrating how to achieve deductive closure in belief sets through minimal revision, enhancing the applicability of Lockean belief sets.

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEVO enhances LLMs for finance via multi-stage training (CPT, SFT, RL), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research applies LLM reasoning advances to finance, which requires domain-specific knowledge.

Method: FEVO uses CPT for domain knowledge, SFT for reasoning, and RL for integration, with curated datasets.

Result: FEVO-R32B outperforms larger and specialist models on five financial benchmarks.

Conclusion: FEVO validates the importance of domain knowledge expansion and structured reasoning for financial LLMs.

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

TL;DR: An AI-based framework combining LSTM, GA, and SHAP improves healthcare energy management, outperforming traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet in forecasting accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies and high costs in healthcare energy management due to fluctuating demands and inadequate traditional methods.

Method: Uses LSTM for time-series forecasting, GA for parameter optimization and load balancing, and SHAP for model transparency.

Result: LSTM achieves lower MAE (21.69) and RMSE (29.96) compared to Prophet and ARIMA, with GA and SHAP enhancing performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: The integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a scalable, efficient, and resilient solution for healthcare energy management, with potential for future real-time and reinforcement learning enhancements.

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety is a modular framework for evaluating AI agent safety across real-world tools and tasks, revealing significant unsafe behaviors in prominent LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for rigorous evaluation of AI agents' safety in real-world settings due to potential unsafe behaviors, as prior benchmarks rely on simulations or narrow domains.

Method: Introduces OpenAgentSafety, a framework evaluating agents using real tools (e.g., web browsers, code execution) and 350+ multi-turn tasks, combining rule-based and LLM-as-judge assessments.

Result: Empirical analysis shows unsafe behavior in 51.2% to 72.7% of tasks across five LLMs, highlighting safety vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Stronger safeguards are needed before deploying AI agents in real-world scenarios, as current models exhibit significant safety risks.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

### [120] [The Delta Learning Hypothesis: Preference Tuning on Weak Data can Yield Strong Gains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06187)
*Scott Geng,Hamish Ivison,Chun-Liang Li,Maarten Sap,Jerry Li,Ranjay Krishna,Pang Wei Koh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Delta learning hypothesis shows that paired preference data, even from weak sources, can improve model performance beyond individual data points, matching state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of scarce strong supervision by leveraging weak paired preference data for model improvement.

Method: Formulated delta learning hypothesis, validated via controlled experiments and large-scale post-training of 8B models using weak preference data (3B and 1.5B model outputs).

Result: Matched performance of Tulu 3 on an 11-benchmark suite, proving delta learning's effectiveness with weaker supervisors.

Conclusion: Delta learning enables cost-effective, high-quality post-training, demonstrating models can learn effectively from weak paired data.

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

### [121] [Identifiability in Causal Abstractions: A Hierarchy of Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06213)
*Clément Yvernes,Emilie Devijver,Marianne Clausel,Eric Gaussier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchy of identifiability criteria for causal queries under causal abstractions, formalized as collections of causal diagrams, to address the challenge of incomplete causal knowledge in observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational data analysis often lacks fully specified causal diagrams, especially in complex settings. Causal abstractions offer simplified representations, but their use for identifiability needs systematic exploration.

Method: The authors formalize identifiability criteria for causal queries within collections of causal diagrams and organize these criteria into a structured hierarchy.

Result: A hierarchical framework is developed to clarify identifiability under varying levels of causal knowledge, supported by examples and tools for reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework enhances understanding of causal query identifiability when full causal knowledge is unavailable, providing practical tools for analysis.

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

### [122] [Aligned Textual Scoring Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06221)
*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Michael J. Curry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR) for text, optimizing alignment with human preference while maintaining properness in scoring rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proper scoring rules for text may not align well with human preferences, necessitating a method that balances properness and alignment.

Method: Designs ASR by minimizing mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g., human score).

Result: ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while preserving properness.

Conclusion: ASR effectively bridges the gap between properness and human-aligned scoring for textual information elicitation.

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

*Yingtai Xiao,Yuqing Zhu,Sirat Samyoun,Wanrong Zhang,Jiachen T. Wang,Jian Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokenShapley improves token-level attribution in LLMs by combining Shapley values and KNN retrieval, outperforming baselines by 11-23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentence-level attribution methods fail for specific keywords in LLM responses, necessitating finer-grained attribution.

Method: TokenShapley integrates Shapley value-based attribution with KNN retrieval, using a precomputed datastore for contextual retrieval.

Result: TokenShapley achieves 11-23% higher accuracy in token-level attribution compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TokenShapley offers a superior fine-grained attribution method for verifying LLM responses at the token level.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

### [124] [User Behavior Prediction as a Generic, Robust, Scalable, and Low-Cost Evaluation Strategy for Estimating Generalization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05266)
*Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes user behavior prediction as a better measure of generalization for LLMs, testing it on recommendation datasets with GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring LLM generalization are flawed due to data contamination and task-specific training limitations.

Method: A novel framework for user behavior prediction is introduced and tested on movie and music recommendation datasets.

Result: GPT-4o outperforms GPT-4o-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, but all models show room for improvement.

Conclusion: User behavior prediction is a viable alternative for measuring LLM generalization, with GPT-4o leading performance.

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Aditya Shah,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASCEND introduces adaptive supervised contrastive learning for implicit sexism detection, outperforming existing methods with significant F1 improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of implicit sexism on social media is often missed by conventional detection methods, necessitating a more nuanced approach.

Method: ASCEND uses threshold-based contrastive learning, jointly optimizing contrastive and cross-entropy losses, and enhances features with word-level attention, sentiment, emotion, and toxicity attributes.

Result: ASCEND achieves average Macro F1 improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% on EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets.

Conclusion: ASCEND effectively captures subtle cues of implicit sexist language, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

*Miloud Mihoubi,Meriem Zerkouk,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel AI framework improves dropout prediction by combining sentiment analysis, prompt engineering, and cross-modal attention, achieving 89% accuracy and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of classical models in capturing emotional and contextual factors in student dropout prediction.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for sentiment analysis, prompt engineering for academic stress detection, and cross-modal attention fusion to integrate diverse data types.

Result: Achieves 89% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%.

Conclusion: The framework bridges predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to reduce dropout risks globally.

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

*Cheng Yuan,Xinkai Rui,Yongqi Fan,Yawei Fan,Boyang Zhong,Jiacheng Wang,Weiyan Zhang,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LCDS is a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary system designed to address LLM hallucination and source attribution issues in EMR-based discharge summaries by using source mapping and logical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate inaccurate or fabricated content in discharge summaries and struggle with source attribution due to long-form EMR data.

Method: LCDS uses a source mapping table (textual similarity between EMRs and summaries) and logical rules to generate reliable summaries with source attribution.

Result: LCDS produces silver discharge summaries tailored to clinical fields, supports expert review, and enables incremental LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LCDS improves discharge summary reliability and source attribution, facilitating expert feedback and LLM refinement.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient methods to leverage libraries of task-specific LoRA adapters for improved performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: Proposes LAG, which filters, retrieves, and applies LoRA adapters per-token and layer without additional training or data.

Result: Superior performance over existing data-free methods on knowledge-intensive tasks; compatible with RAG when data is available.

Conclusion: LAG is a versatile and efficient solution for leveraging LoRA adapters, adaptable to both data-free and data-augmented scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and
domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We
propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of
knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training
or access to data, and efficiently filters, retrieves, and applies experts on a
per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive
tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We
explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation

*Riccardo Alberghi,Elizaveta Demyanenko,Luca Biggio,Luca Saglietti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training LLMs on inefficient reasoning traces (e.g., backtracking) improves generalization over optimal traces, linked to model confidence in next-token prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how compute allocation and reasoning structure (e.g., systematic vs. redundant) impact LLM performance on reasoning tasks.

Method: Train decoder-only transformers on shortest-path tasks using question-trace-answer triples, comparing optimal dynamic programming traces with inefficient backtracking traces.

Result: Models trained on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs, with generalization tied to next-token prediction confidence.

Conclusion: Long, coherent, and locally incremental reasoning traces enhance training optimization, outperforming optimal but rigid traces.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general-purpose annotation tools lack features for the complexities of educational dialogue, such as diverse interactions and pedagogical nuances.

Method: EduCoder provides a platform for collaborative codebook definition, supports categorical and open-ended annotations, includes contextual materials, and enables annotator comparison for reliability.

Result: The tool is open-source and includes a demo, demonstrating its feasibility for educational dialogue annotation.

Conclusion: EduCoder fills a gap in annotation tools for educational research, offering specialized features to improve data reliability and collaboration.

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, reveals that predictive information peaks in upper-middle layers (generalization ridge) before declining in final layers, highlighting the role of intermediate layers in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how task-relevant information propagates across transformer layers during training, as prior work lacks clarity on this mechanism.

Method: Proposes InfoRidge to estimate predictive information (mutual information between hidden representations and target outputs) across layers and introduces residual scaling coefficients to probe layer importance.

Result: Predictive information peaks in upper-middle layers (generalization ridge) and declines in final layers; under distribution shift, models rely more on ridge layers.

Conclusion: Intermediate layers are critical for generalization in transformers, offering new insights into their internal mechanisms.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

*Guillem Ramírez,Alexandra Birch,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes privacy profiles—natural language instructions to control data exposure—when using LLMs via APIs, balancing privacy and performance. It introduces PEEP, a dataset for this research, and tests lightweight LLMs, revealing challenges in compliance with user-defined privacy preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users risk exposing sensitive data when accessing LLMs via commercial APIs. The paper aims to empower users with control over their data through privacy profiles.

Method: A framework is developed where a local model rewrites queries based on privacy profiles, hiding sensitive details before sending to an external LLM. The PEEP dataset supports this research.

Result: Lightweight LLMs can partially follow privacy instructions but struggle with consistent compliance, indicating a need for improved models.

Conclusion: Privacy profiles offer a promising approach to data control, but better models are needed to fully adhere to user-defined privacy preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

TL;DR: GeoFact-X is a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning in low-resource languages, and BRIDGE is a training method to improve language-consistent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often default to English reasoning in multilingual tasks, undermining accuracy and trust, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Introduces GeoFact-X benchmark with annotated reasoning traces in five languages and proposes BRIDGE, a training method using language-consistency rewards.

Result: BRIDGE significantly improves multilingual reasoning fidelity, showing the importance of reasoning-aware reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is key for robust cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoPE evaluates how LLMs prioritize contextual (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK), revealing a 'lost-in-the-later' bias and showing CoT prompting degrades contextual grounding. CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs integrate and prioritize CK and PK, which remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces CoPE framework and MultiWikiAtomic dataset to analyze CK and PK integration in LLMs across languages. Examines positional bias and CoT prompting effects.

Result: LLMs show 'lost-in-the-later' bias; CoT reduces contextual grounding. CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding in summarization.

Conclusion: CoPE reveals biases in LLMs' knowledge integration; CK-informed methods enhance factual accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual

### [136] [Gendered Divides in Online Discussions about Reproductive Rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05443)
*Ashwin Rao,Sze Yuh Nina Wang,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes 10 million abortion-related posts on X (Twitter) to show how gender and local sociopolitical contexts shape abortion discourse, revealing a pronounced gender gap in conservative regions, intensified by the Dobbs ruling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how gender and local contexts interact to influence public discourse on abortion, beyond ideological divides.

Method: Analyzed nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X (Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology, and location.

Result: Gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional expression, especially in conservative regions, creating a pronounced gender gap. The Dobbs leak further mobilized pro-abortion women in threatened areas.

Conclusion: Abortion discourse is not just ideologically polarized but also deeply shaped by gender and place, emphasizing identity's role in political expression during institutional disruptions.

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

TL;DR: PhoniTale, a cross-lingual mnemonic generation system, uses LLMs to aid L2 vocabulary learning by leveraging L1 phonological similarities, performing comparably to human-authored mnemonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of vocabulary acquisition for L2 learners, especially in typologically distant languages like English and Korean, where phonological mismatches complicate learning.

Method: PhoniTale retrieves L1 keyword sequences based on phonological similarity and employs LLMs to generate mnemonics, evaluated via automated metrics, human evaluations, and a recall test.

Result: PhoniTale's mnemonics perform comparably to human-authored ones, demonstrating practical effectiveness in aiding vocabulary recall.

Conclusion: The system shows promise but identifies areas for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs like ChatGPT truly understand language by analyzing their semantic capabilities at word and sentence levels, referencing classical theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the extent of LLMs' language understanding, focusing on semantics.

Method: Examines LLMs' inner workings and language representations, using classical semantic theories (Frege and Russell).

Result: Provides a nuanced view of LLMs' semantic potential.

Conclusion: LLMs' understanding of language is complex and requires deeper semantic analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MODELCITIZENS, a dataset for toxicity detection that captures diverse annotator perspectives and conversational context, and releases finetuned models (LLAMACITIZEN-8B, GEMMACITIZEN-12B) that outperform existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing toxicity detection models erase diverse annotator perspectives and context-specific notions of toxicity, necessitating a more inclusive approach.

Method: The authors create MODELCITIZENS, a dataset with 6.8K posts and 40K annotations, augmented with LLM-generated conversational context. They finetune LLaMA- and Gemma-based models on this dataset.

Result: State-of-the-art tools underperform on MODELCITIZENS, while the finetuned models (LLAMACITIZEN-8B, GEMMACITIZEN-12B) outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5%.

Conclusion: Community-informed annotation and modeling are crucial for inclusive content moderation.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling

Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and sensitivity in high-impact clinical NLP tasks to reduce healthcare documentation burden.

Method: Evaluates open- and closed-weight LLMs on private and open-source datasets, proposes an agentic pipeline for generating realistic nurse dictations.

Result: Performance analysis of LLMs on the tasks and release of SYNUR and SIMORD datasets.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for clinical NLP tasks; new datasets support further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

TL;DR: R2-LLMs is a hierarchical retrieval-augmented framework improving test-time scaling in LLMs without needing CoT training data, enhancing reasoning via dual-level retrieval and MCTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inference-time generalization in LLMs without relying on distillation from advanced models for CoT data.

Method: Uses dual-level retrieval (coarse for problem-answer pairs, fine for intermediate steps) and MCTS with a PRM for scoring.

Result: Achieves up to 16% improvement on MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO datasets using LLaMA-3.1-8B.

Conclusion: R2-LLMs effectively enhances reasoning in complex tasks by integrating hierarchical retrieval and step-level refinement.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

### [142] [Self-Review Framework for Enhancing Instruction Following Capability of LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05598)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Re5 is a self-evaluation and revision framework for LLMs that improves instruction-following without degrading output quality, achieving high performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving LLM adherence to instructions face issues like high costs, quality degradation, or limited self-evaluation capabilities.

Method: Re5 extracts task and constraint components, performs structural evaluations, and applies selective revisions to ensure precise improvements.

Result: Re5 matches GPT-4o-mini's performance with less data and maintains quality, winning 64.24% over non-revised responses.

Conclusion: Re5 is an efficient, effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

### [143] [Flipping Knowledge Distillation: Leveraging Small Models' Expertise to Enhance LLMs in Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05617)
*Mingzhe Li,Jing Xiang,Qishen Zhang,Kaiyang Wan,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A flipped knowledge distillation paradigm where LLMs learn from SLMs, addressing architectural gaps and improving performance via Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage domain-specific strengths of small models and rich semantics of LLMs for tasks like text matching.

Method: Reinterpret LLMs as encoder-decoder using LoRA; align similarity scores from SLM to LLM via MCL.

Result: Improved performance on financial and healthcare benchmarks, deployed in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The paradigm effectively combines SLM strengths with LLM capabilities, validated by practical deployment.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in RAG like limited context length and redundancy in retrieved documents while preserving factual accuracy.

Method: Combines natural-language snippets with semantic compression vectors for efficient context representation and dynamic reranking.

Result: Improves answer relevance (+17.71), correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53) across 9 datasets and 5 LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating textual and compressed representations is key for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Result: Reduces unintended Chinese output by over 95% while maintaining task accuracy on multilingual benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, practical solution to improve language controllability in LLMs for global applications.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit language confusion, a

selectively adjusts token-level output probabilities to effectively suppress
undesired language generation. Applied to the Qwen model, our method reduces

Conclusion: Multi-strategy distillation via DualDistill effectively enhances reasoning performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Current long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models excel at mathematical
reasoning but rely on slow and error-prone natural language traces.
Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter
on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill,
that distills complementary reasoning strategies from multiple teachers into a

dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for
arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for
abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including

Result: A reusable evaluation framework, benchmark data, and public leaderboard are released to foster community involvement.

Conclusion: DRAGON addresses the gap in dynamic RAG evaluation for Russian and offers tools adaptable to other languages.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for
improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG
benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including
Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first
dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news
corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RAG models by addressing inconsistent document quality and retrieval system imperfections, and to enhance their hierarchical abilities.

Method: Proposes HIRAG, a method incorporating hierarchical abilities (filtering, combination, RAG-specific reasoning) and a 'think before answering' strategy.

Result: HIRAG significantly improves model performance on datasets like RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Conclusion: HIRAG enhances RAG models' capabilities, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling real-time and domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE methods like the Switch Transformer route experts independently per layer, leading to weak correlation between layer choices. The goal is to enhance cooperation and specialization among experts.

Method: The proposed Omni-router Transformer uses a shared router across MoE layers to align expert choices and improve collaboration.

Result: The model outperforms dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, and shows improved robustness.

Conclusion: Shared routing in MoE architectures enhances performance and specialization, making the Omni-router Transformer a strong alternative for ASR tasks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are used in multi-turn conversations but are pre-trained on continuous prose, creating a mismatch. The goal is to bridge this gap by generating conversational data.

Method: A pipeline transforms related documents into multi-turn dialogues, creating DocTalk, a corpus of 730k+ conversations.

Result: Pre-training with DocTalk improves context memory and understanding by up to 40%.

Conclusion: DocTalk effectively enhances LLMs' multi-turn conversational abilities while maintaining their foundational performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

*Amane Watahiki,Tomoki Doi,Taiga Shinozaki,Satoshi Nishida,Takuya Niikawa,Katsunori Miyahara,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large vision-language models (LVLMs) on amodal completion tasks, revealing performance gaps, especially in Japanese prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LVLMs' inferential abilities on amodal completion tasks, which remain unexplored despite their importance in multimodal systems.

Method: Constructed a benchmark using Basic Formal Ontology for systematic classification of amodal completion tasks.

Result: LVLMs show human-comparable performance overall but diverge in accuracy for certain objects, with some models performing worse on original images than blank stimuli under Japanese prompting.

Conclusion: LVLMs exhibit deficiencies in Japanese-specific linguistic competence, highlighting a need for improvement in multilingual and multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

*Tanvina Patel,Wiebke Hutiri,Aaron Yi Ding,Odette Scharenborg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares performance and bias measures for Dutch ASR systems, highlighting the insufficiency of averaged error rates and recommending additional metrics for better representation of system bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive measures for evaluating ASR system performance and bias, especially for diverse speaker groups.

Method: Comparison of various performance and bias measures, including literature-based and proposed metrics, applied to state-of-the-art Dutch ASR systems with bias mitigation strategies.

Result: Averaged error rates alone are inadequate; supplementary measures are needed to better assess system bias and performance across diverse speaker groups.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for improved reporting of ASR performance and bias to ensure fair representation for all speaker groups.

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

*Sungjib Lim,Woojung Song,Eun-Ju Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs to simulate diverse virtual respondents for scalable and cost-effective psychometric survey item generation, ensuring construct validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable survey item generation for LLMs while ensuring construct validity, traditionally requiring costly human data collection.

Method: Simulates virtual respondents with diverse mediators to identify robust survey items. Uses LLMs to generate plausible mediators and simulate behavior for validation.

Result: Effective identification of high-validity items for three psychological trait theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA). LLMs show capability in mediator generation and behavior simulation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a cost-effective solution for survey development and insights into LLM replication of human-like behavior. Dataset and code will be released for future work.

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of evaluation methodologies for knowledge editing in models, highlighting biases and false positives in current metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration into the robustness of evaluation methodologies for knowledge editing and their impact on model capabilities.

Method: Analyzes different metrics, evaluation methodologies, and edit batch sizes, and includes a manual assessment of string-matching evaluation methods.

Result: Shows that metric and methodology choices can alter editor rankings and reveals false positives in string-matching evaluations.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust and fair evaluation practices in knowledge editing.

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

### [159] [Remember Past, Anticipate Future: Learning Continual Multimodal Misinformation Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05939)
*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Mengzhe Ye,Changchun Li,Bo Fu,Jianfeng Qu,Lin Yuanbo Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DAEDCMD, a method for continual Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) to address challenges of past knowledge forgetting and evolving social environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation, especially multimodal, spreads widely on social media, causing harm. Current MMD methods trained on offline data fail in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Method: DAEDCMD isolates event-specific parameters using a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure and learns a continuous-time dynamics model for future environmental changes.

Result: DAEDCMD outperforms six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses continual MMD challenges, improving detection performance over time.

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

*Sandeep Mishra,Anubhab Mandal,Bishal Santra,Tushar Abhishek,Pawan Goyal,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the understudied problem of Chat-Ghosting (auto-completion in chat interfaces), comparing methods like tries, n-grams, and deep learning, and introduces an entropy-based early stopping strategy. Findings show n-grams/tries excel for seen prefixes, while neural models like T5/Phi-2 perform better for unseen queries. Context improves results, especially in human-bot datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ghosting enhances user experience in chat interfaces, but lacks research attention, benchmarks, and performance analysis. The study aims to fill this gap.

Method: Uses four dialog datasets (human-human and human-bot), compares tries, n-grams, and deep learning methods, and proposes an entropy-based early stopping strategy.

Result: N-grams/tries outperform deep learning for seen prefixes; neural models like T5/Phi-2 excel for unseen queries. Context boosts performance, notably in human-bot datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into Chat-Ghosting, highlighting the trade-offs between methods and the value of context. Publicly released code/data supports further research.

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

*Lucas Fonseca Lage,Simon Ostermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenFActScore is an open-source version of FActScore for evaluating LLM-generated text factuality, using open models for Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) and Validation (AFV). It matches closed-source performance and promotes transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a transparent, reproducible, and cost-effective alternative to the closed-source FActScore framework for evaluating LLM-generated text factuality.

Method: Uses AFG to extract factual claims and AFV to verify them against trusted sources, replacing closed-source models with Hugging Face-compatible ones. Evaluated using BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate for AFV.

Result: Open models like Gemma approximate closed-source performance, with a 0.99 Pearson correlation to original FActScore.

Conclusion: OpenFActScore successfully replicates FActScore's functionality with open models, offering transparency and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the ACL community for neglecting real-world impact evaluations in NLP systems, noting only 0.1% of ACL Anthology papers address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the lack of focus on real-world impact in NLP research and advocate for its importance in making NLP technology more useful and widely adopted.

Method: Conducted a structured survey of the ACL Anthology to analyze the prevalence and depth of real-world impact evaluations in NLP papers.

Result: Found minimal (0.1%) inclusion of real-world impact evaluations, with most papers prioritizing metric evaluations over practical impact.

Conclusion: Urges the NLP community to prioritize and rigorously evaluate real-world impact to enhance the utility and adoption of NLP technology.

Abstract: The ACL community has very little interest in evaluating the real-world
impact of NLP systems. A structured survey of the ACL Anthology shows that
perhaps 0.1% of its papers contain such evaluations; furthermore most papers
which include impact evaluations present them very sketchily and instead focus
on metric evaluations. NLP technology would be more useful and more quickly
adopted if we seriously tried to understand and evaluate its real-world impact.

TL;DR: RabakBench is a multilingual safety benchmark for low-resource languages in Singapore, addressing LLM safety classifier limitations through a scalable pipeline of generation, labeling, and translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and safety classifiers underperform in low-resource languages due to limited data and benchmarks. RabakBench aims to fill this gap for Singapore's linguistic context.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (i) adversarial example generation, (ii) semi-automated multi-label safety annotation, and (iii) high-fidelity translation.

Result: Over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six categories, revealing performance degradation in 11 guardrail classifiers.

Conclusion: RabakBench provides a robust evaluation tool for multilingual safety in low-resource settings and a reproducible framework for localized datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-evolution method for language models reduces training costs and carbon emissions by using a large-scale model to generate task principles and a smaller model for data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high carbon emissions and data leakage risks in traditional data augmentation methods using closed-source LLMs.

Method: Multi-level Principle Generation for task principles and Principle-based Instance Generation for data creation using a smaller model.

Result: Improved model performance and reduced carbon emissions compared to direct data generation with smaller models.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative for language model training.

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, high-quality annotated corpora are scarce for document-level entity and relation extraction, especially in zero-shot or few-shot settings.

Method: The method combines synthetic data generation with retrieval-based in-context learning using a reasoning-optimized language model, avoiding manual annotation.

Result: A synthetic dataset of over 5k Wikipedia abstracts with ~59k entities and 30k relation triples was produced. Evaluation on the DocIE shared task showed challenges in zero-shot document-level extraction.

Conclusion: In-context joint entity and relation extraction at document-level is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, even with synthetic data and retrieval-based learning.

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents often face execution failures, necessitating robust recovery mechanisms.

Method: The framework uses four error-handling stages (three during execution, one post-execution) and leverages LLMs for contextual reasoning and solution generation.

Result: Outperforms baseline by 11.5% and existing models by 19% on the TfD benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses execution failures, enhancing agent performance.

Abstract: Embodied agents performing complex tasks are susceptible to execution
failures, motivating the need for effective failure recovery mechanisms. In
this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework
that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

TL;DR: The paper explores how data entropy in LLMs correlates with memorization difficulty, introducing the Entropy-Memorization Law and demonstrating its application in distinguishing training and testing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the difficulty of memorization in LLMs, particularly focusing on the role of data entropy.

Method: Empirical experiments on OLMo models, analyzing memorization scores and data entropy, with a case study on randomized strings.

Result: Data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score, and randomized strings show unexpectedly low empirical entropy.

Conclusion: The Entropy-Memorization Law provides a framework for understanding memorization in LLMs and enables practical applications like Dataset Inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

Abstract: This survey reviews prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting language models by prepending trainable continuous vectors while
keeping the model frozen. We classify existing approaches into two categories:
direct prompt learning and transfer learning. Direct prompt learning methods
include: general optimization approaches, encoder-based methods, decomposition
strategies, and mixture-of-experts frameworks. Transfer learning methods
consist of: general transfer approaches, encoder-based methods, and
decomposition strategies. For each method, we analyze method designs,
innovations, insights, advantages, and disadvantages, with illustrative
visualizations comparing different frameworks. We identify challenges in
computational efficiency and training stability, and discuss future directions
in improving training robustness and broadening application scope.

*Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Dheeraj Varghese,Marzieh Fadaee,Cees G. M. Snoek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeoBabel is a multilingual text-to-image generation framework supporting six languages, outperforming existing models in performance, efficiency, and inclusivity while avoiding semantic drift and cultural misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the English-centric bias in text-to-image generation, which creates barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuates digital inequities.

Method: Combines large-scale multilingual pretraining with high-resolution instruction tuning, evaluated on expanded multilingual benchmarks (m-GenEval and m-DPG).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance (0.75 on m-GenEval, 0.68 on m-DPG) while matching English-only models, despite being 2-4x smaller.

Conclusion: Multilingual capability enhances robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI, demonstrated by NeoBabel's open toolkit and standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

*Taolin Zhang,Zihan Ma,Maosong Cao,Junnan Liu,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Code Triangle framework to evaluate LLMs in code generation, revealing gaps in diversity and robustness compared to humans. It suggests human input and model mixtures can improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the programming competence of LLMs, which remains underexplored despite their progress in code generation.

Method: The Code Triangle framework evaluates LLMs across three dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation, using competitive programming benchmarks.

Result: LLMs form a self-consistent system but lack human-like diversity and robustness. Human input and model mixtures enhance performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLM limitations and proposes human collaboration and self-reflection as paths to more powerful coding models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between text-only reasoning and visual tasks by leveraging LLMs' reasoning skills for multimodal applications.

Method: Uses an elaborate post-training RL framework to enhance reasoning without additional pre-training, focusing on the connector module and a unique entropy-based checkpoint selection.

Result: Achieves 76.0% on MMMU, matching human entry-level performance, and rivals closed-source VLMs with a 38B parameter model.

Conclusion: Skywork-R1V3 demonstrates RL's power in advancing open-source VLMs, with implications for multimodal reasoning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CriticLean introduces a critic-guided reinforcement learning framework to improve semantic fidelity in translating natural language math statements to formal code, outperforming baselines and creating a high-quality dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of focus on the critic phase in automated theorem proving, ensuring generated formalizations accurately reflect the original problem's intent.

Method: Proposes CriticLeanGPT (trained via supervised fine-tuning and RL) and CriticLeanBench for benchmarking, alongside the FineLeanCorpus dataset.

Result: CriticLeanGPT outperforms baselines, and FineLeanCorpus provides a diverse, high-quality dataset for formal mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Optimizing the critic phase is crucial for reliable formalizations, with CriticLean offering insights for future formal math reasoning advancements.

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper explores transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation for subjectivity detection in English news text, finding specialized encoders and curated augmentation improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance classification of subjective and objective sentences in news text using advanced NLP techniques.

Method: Fine-tuning pre-trained encoders, transfer-learning fine-tuned transformers, and GPT-4o-based augmentation with label correction.

Result: Transfer-learning specialized encoders outperforms general-purpose fine-tuning, and curated augmentation boosts robustness, especially for subjective content.

Conclusion: Combining specialized encoders with label-consistent augmentation improves subjectivity detection, as shown by the team's 16th-place ranking out of 24.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

*Maximilian Heil,Aleksandar Pramov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates modeling strategies for fact-checking numerical claims, focusing on evidence retrieval and tokenization, finding that neither R2L tokenization nor longer context windows improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical claims pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking, requiring specialized modeling strategies.

Method: The study uses the QuanTemp dataset and a custom evidence retrieval pipeline to test ModernBERT with longer context windows and R2L tokenization.

Result: R2L tokenization and longer context windows did not improve performance; evidence quality was the bottleneck. The best system achieved a 0.57 F1 score.

Conclusion: Evidence quality is critical for numerical claim verification, and the study's system performed competitively in the CheckThat! 2025 task.

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper surveys latent reasoning in LLMs, which replaces explicit chain-of-thought reasoning with continuous hidden state inference, enhancing expressive bandwidth. It covers methodologies, advanced paradigms, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of explicit chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs, which restricts expressive bandwidth, by exploring latent reasoning as an alternative.

Method: Examines neural network layers as reasoning substrates, explores latent reasoning methodologies (activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, fine-tuning), and discusses advanced paradigms like infinite-depth latent reasoning.

Result: Provides a unified overview of latent reasoning, highlighting its potential to improve LLM cognition and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning offers a promising alternative to explicit reasoning, with future research directions aimed at advancing LLM cognition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

*Zhiyuan Peng,Ting-ruen Wei,Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces E²R-FLOPs, new metrics for evaluating LLM-based rerankers, addressing inefficiency in existing proxy metrics by focusing on relevance per compute (RPP) and hardware-agnostic throughput (QPP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficiency metrics for LLM-based rerankers are hardware-dependent and fail to account for model size, making it hard to evaluate the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff.

Method: Proposes E²R-FLOPs metrics (RPP and QPP) and an interpretable FLOPs estimator to evaluate rerankers without experiments.

Result: Comprehensive experiments evaluate various LLM-based rerankers, highlighting efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs.

Conclusion: The new metrics provide a clearer, hardware-agnostic way to assess reranker performance, encouraging better efficiency-effectiveness analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Motivation: Language agents struggle with error correction and cross-domain experience reuse, limiting their problem-solving capabilities.

Method: Agent KB uses a Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline to create a shared knowledge base for cross-agent knowledge transfer, capturing high-level strategies and execution logs.

Result: Agent KB improves success rates by up to 16.28 percentage points on GAIA, with notable gains for Claude-3 and GPT-4, and enhances code repair performance on SWE-bench.

Conclusion: Agent KB offers a modular, framework-agnostic solution for agents to learn from past experiences and generalize strategies to new tasks.

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

*Kaichen Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores over-smoothing in GNNs, linking it to Anderson localization, and proposes reducing disorder to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the over-smoothing issue in deep GNNs by drawing parallels with Anderson localization.

Method: Analyzes over-smoothing via participation degree and theoretical connections to disordered systems.

Result: Identifies over-smoothing as low-frequency mode expansion and high-frequency mode localization.

Conclusion: Reducing disorder in information propagation could alleviate over-smoothing in GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method is proposed to improve transformer-based time series forecasting by whitening exogenous inputs to reduce redundancy and enhance long-term dependency awareness, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with redundancy in exogenous inputs and limited long-term dependency capture due to fixed look-back windows.

Method: Whitens exogenous inputs using global statistics to reduce redundancy and improve long-term pattern awareness, integrating them with endogenous inputs without extending the look-back window.

Result: Outperforms 11 baseline models on four benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The method is a robust and effective solution for leveraging exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

TL;DR: A novel DNN compression method using XAI (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) to reduce model size by 64% with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are computationally expensive; compression techniques like pruning and quantization are needed for edge devices. XAI helps understand DNN inner workings for better compression.

Method: Uses LRP to compute importance scores of DNN weights, prunes negative/zero scores, and applies mixed-precision quantization based on scores.

Result: Model size reduced by 64%, accuracy improved by 42% compared to state-of-the-art XAI-based compression.

Conclusion: XAI-based compression effectively reduces DNN size with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

Result: Achieves accurate local stress field distributions and significant computational speed-ups, especially in non-linear hyperelastic cases.

Conclusion: P-DivGNN is efficient and scalable for large-scale applications, outperforming FE simulations in speed while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

*Gianluca Dalmasso,Andrea Bragagnolo,Enzo Tartaglione,Attilio Fiandrotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeVe introduces 'neural velocity' to dynamically adjust learning rate and stop training, reducing reliance on validation loss and held-out datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning often depends on validation loss, which requires a held-out dataset. NeVe aims to optimize training without this dependency.

Method: NeVe uses neural velocity, measuring neuron transfer function changes, to adjust learning rate and stop training. It can sample velocity by forwarding noise.

Result: Neural velocity effectively indicates convergence, enabling efficient training optimization without a held-out dataset.

Conclusion: Neural velocity is a promising metric for dynamic and efficient neural network training.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping
criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents
NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

*Madina Kojanazarova,Florentin Bieder,Robin Sandkühler,Philippe C. Cattin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven model using conditional graph neural networks (cGNN) predicts soft tissue deformation and interaction forces, achieving high accuracy with minimal error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft tissue simulation in medical applications faces challenges due to high deformability and the need for precise haptic feedback.

Method: The proposed cGNN model uses surface points and force locations, trained on experimental data and mass-spring simulations via transfer learning.

Result: The model predicts deformations with 0.35±0.03 mm error and forces with 0.37±0.05 N error.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising solution for realistic soft tissue simulations, with potential applications beyond medical fields.

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

*Marc Bara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First dataless neural network approach for RCPSP, transforming scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives for gradient-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No prior work extends dataless neural networks to RCPSP, despite their success in other combinatorial problems.

Method: Uses smooth relaxations, automatic differentiation, and a dense time-grid representation to encode constraints.

Result: Implementation and experiments on PSPLIB benchmarks (J30, J60, J120) are ongoing.

Conclusion: This work pioneers dataless neural networks for RCPSP, promising GPU parallelization for scheduling.

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

### [187] [Going Beyond Heuristics by Imposing Policy Improvement as a Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05328)
*Chi-Chang Lee,Zhang-Wei Hong,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEPO is a new RL framework that leverages heuristic rewards effectively by focusing on policy improvement rather than policy invariance, reducing human effort in reward design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heuristic rewards in RL often require careful balancing and are not optimal, leading to wasted effort and poor performance. Policy invariance methods fail to improve policies.

Method: HEPO (Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization) maximizes policy improvement instead of policy invariance, avoiding reward hacking pitfalls.

Result: HEPO outperforms standard benchmarks with well-engineered rewards and works well even with poorly designed heuristics.

Conclusion: HEPO reduces human effort in reward design and improves RL performance by effectively using heuristic rewards.

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

*Jeroen Audenaert,Daniel Muthukrishna,Paul F. Gregory,David W. Hogg,V. Ashley Villar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causally-motivated foundation model disentangles physical and instrumental factors in time series data, improving generalization and performance in heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observations often mix true physical phenomena with instrumental distortions, limiting model generalization in multi-instrument settings.

Method: Uses a dual-encoder architecture with structured contrastive learning, leveraging observational triplets to separate latent representations of physical signals and instrument effects.

Result: Outperforms traditional models on simulated astronomical time series, especially in low-data regimes, demonstrating few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation.

Conclusion: Encoding causal structure into representation learning is crucial for foundation models handling structured data.

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) in continual post-training (CPT), finding RFT better preserves prior knowledge and general capabilities, while SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of learning paradigms (SFT vs. RFT) on knowledge retention in continual post-training, an area previously understudied.

Method: Comparative analysis of SFT and RFT on seven multimodal tasks using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with experiments and a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm for RFT.

Result: RFT preserves prior knowledge and general capabilities, outperforming SFT, which causes catastrophic forgetting and degrades general model performance.

Conclusion: RFT is superior for continual post-training due to its implicit regularization, and the proposed filtering algorithm enhances its stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance formal verification of neural networks by tightening reachable sets with minimal computational overhead.

Method: Combines LiRPA-based over-approximation with sampling to estimate tight intermediate reachable sets.

Result: Improves robustness certificates by up to 3.31X and 2.26X, with 99% confidence in challenging cases.

Conclusion: PT-LiRPA offers a probabilistic, efficient solution for neural network verification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{P}$robabilistically $\textbf{T}$ightened
$\textbf{Li}$near $\textbf{R}$elaxation-based $\textbf{P}$erturbation
$\textbf{A}$nalysis ($\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$), a novel framework that combines
over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based
method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that
with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the
estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide
answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).

TL;DR: AXLearn is a modular deep learning system for scalable training, focusing on heterogeneous hardware and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable, high-performance training of large models with modularity and support for diverse hardware.

Method: Uses strict encapsulation and introduces LoC-complexity to quantify modularity, enabling rapid integration of features like RoPE with minimal code.

Result: AXLearn achieves constant complexity scaling, outperforms others in modularity, and matches state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: AXLearn successfully balances modularity, scalability, and performance, with practical insights from its development.

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that
facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning
models. Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a
unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware
infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components
follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to
facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via
Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred
of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in
other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance
compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience
in the development and operation of AXLearn.

*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RepLIn, a method to learn robust representations of causally-related latent variables by leveraging interventional data and enforcing independence conditions derived from the causal model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat interventional data like observational data, ignoring causal independence relations, leading to performance disparities. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose RepLIn, a training algorithm that enforces statistical independence during interventions, derived from theoretical conditions for linear models.

Result: RepLIn reduces performance disparities and improves robustness on synthetic and real datasets (facial attribute classification, toxicity detection).

Conclusion: RepLIn is scalable and effective for learning robust representations against interventional distribution shifts for both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Motivation: Agricultural emissions are a major but understudied source of air pollution, and current physics-based models fail to capture complex pollutant interactions.

Method: The study evaluates popular architectures and introduces two new deep learning models (ENV and ENT) combining convolutional and transformer-based approaches to analyze spatial-temporal data.

Result: The proposed models, ENV and ENT, aim to better capture nonlinear interactions in high-resolution emissions data.

Conclusion: Deep learning architectures like ENV and ENT show promise for more accurate forecasting of agricultural N$_2$O emissions compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Air pollution from agricultural emissions is a significant yet often

TL;DR: MVMO attacks enable distressed firms to manipulate financial reports more effectively, inflating earnings by 100-200% while reducing fraud scores by 15% in 50% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distressed firms seek to hide financial distress and gain personal benefits by manipulating reports, leveraging existing financial frameworks.

Method: Introduces Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks, adapting search direction to outperform standard methods.

Result: Achieves 20x more satisfying attacks, with 50% success in inflating earnings by 100-200% and reducing fraud scores by 15%.

Conclusion: MVMO attacks present a realistic and potent threat, validated by legal and accounting professionals.

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

TL;DR: A unified, distributional multi-step RL framework is introduced to tackle delayed and sparse rewards in games like 2048, outperforming standard methods with H-DQN achieving the highest scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delayed and sparse rewards in RL, exemplified by the game 2048, hinder agents from learning globally optimal strategies due to misleading immediate feedback.

Method: Developed and compared four RL agents (DQN, PPO, QR-DQN, H-DQN) in the Gym-2048 environment, with H-DQN integrating advanced techniques like distributional learning and prioritized replay.

Result: H-DQN achieved the highest performance (max score 41.828K, 4096 tile), surpassing other agents (DQN: 3.988K, PPO: 5.756K, QR-DQN: 8.66K).

Conclusion: Distributional, multi-step RL significantly improves performance in sparse-reward domains, with potential for further gains via model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using forward-backward (FB) representations for exploration in zero-shot reinforcement learning to improve sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot reinforcement learning lacks concrete rewards, and existing methods decouple FB representations from exploration, limiting efficiency.

Method: Designs exploration policies from FB representations to minimize epistemic uncertainty by reducing posterior variance.

Result: Empirical results show improved sample complexity compared to other exploration methods.

Conclusion: FB-based exploration enhances learning efficiency in zero-shot reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

TL;DR: The paper reframes dynamic regret minimization in online convex optimization as a static regret problem in a function space using RKHS, achieving optimal guarantees and practical computability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve low cumulative loss relative to arbitrary benchmark sequences in online convex optimization, addressing limitations of prior methods limited to linear losses.

Method: Reduces dynamic regret to static regret in a function space by constructing a suitable RKHS, enabling recovery of optimal guarantees and new adaptive bounds.

Result: Achieves optimal dynamic regret guarantees for linear losses and extends to exp-concave and improper linear regression settings with practical computability.

Conclusion: The RKHS-based reduction provides a versatile and computable framework for dynamic regret minimization across various loss settings.

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

*Van Khoa Nguyen,Lionel Blondé,Alexandros Kalousis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a training-free framework for diffusion models that unifies stochastic optimal control (SOC) and classifier-based guidance, correcting approximate posteriors for more reliable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOC methods are computationally intensive, while training-free classifier-based approximations introduce errors, leading to unreliable guidance.

Method: SDG combines SOC and classifier-based guidance, using Stein variational inference to correct approximate posteriors and a novel running cost functional for effective guidance.

Result: SDG outperforms standard training-free methods in molecular generation tasks.

Conclusion: SDG offers a principled, effective solution for diffusion guidance, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To dynamically predict campus building traffic flows without assuming occupant behavior or compromising privacy, leveraging Wi-Fi data and building schedules.

Result: GCLSTM significantly outperforms traditional methods (MLP, Linear Regression) in predicting pedestrian flows.

Conclusion: The integrated GCLSTM model is effective for dynamic occupancy and movement prediction, offering interpretability and superior performance.

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for
predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic
temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined
with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are
directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour
or preferences while maintaining individual privacy. We formulate the problem
as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing
buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph
Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our
proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models
significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication overhead is a bottleneck in distributed learning, and existing gradient compression techniques face a trade-off between empirical efficiency (biased compressors) and theoretical guarantees (unbiased compressors).

Method: The proposed MLMC compression scheme uses biased compressors to create unbiased estimates, combining strengths of both. It is applied to popular compressors (e.g., Top-$k$ and bit-wise) and includes an adaptive version for improved performance.

Conclusion: The MLMC scheme effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased compressors, offering a versatile and improved solution for distributed learning.

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent

Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased

effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods like R-learner and Causal Forest by over 20%, proving cost-efficiency and real-world impact.

Conclusion: The method is versatile, effective in production, and applicable to various scenarios like optimal treatment allocation.

Abstract: User growth is a major strategy for consumer internet companies. To optimize
costly marketing campaigns and maximize user engagement, we propose a novel
treatment effect optimization methodology to enhance user growth marketing. By
leveraging deep learning, our algorithm learns from past experiments to
optimize user selection and reward allocation, maximizing campaign impact while
minimizing costs. Unlike traditional prediction methods, our model directly
models uplifts in key business metrics. Further, our deep learning model can

outperform state-of-the-art methods by over $20\%$, proving their
cost-efficiency and real-world impact. The versatile methods can be applied to
various product scenarios, including optimal treatment allocation. Its

### [203] [Deep Learning of Continuous and Structured Policies for Aggregated Heterogeneous Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05511)
*Jennifer Y. Zhang,Shuyang Du,Will Y. Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) with structured treatment policies, combining multiple policy factors like continuous intensity and discrete assignments. It proposes a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer for ranking subjects based on aggregated HTE functions, validated on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of expanding treatment action spaces beyond binary variables to structured policies, enabling more nuanced HTE estimation.

Method: The method involves deriving formulations for multiple treatment policy variables, developing a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework, and applying it to continuous/discrete treatments and ranking.

Result: The framework improves performance on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex treatment policies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a generic deep learning framework for HTE estimation, adaptable to various treatment policies and validated for practical use.

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

*Anish Dhir,Cristiana Diaconu,Valentinian Mihai Lungu,James Requeima,Richard E. Turner,Mark van der Wilk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MACE-TNP, a meta-learning model for Bayesian causal inference, addressing structural uncertainty in causal graphs without expensive computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage structural uncertainty in causal inference when domain knowledge is absent, avoiding overconfidence from committing to a single causal structure.

Method: Proposes MACE-TNP, an end-to-end meta-learning model that predicts Bayesian model-averaged interventional distributions, bypassing intractable computations.

Result: MACE-TNP outperforms strong Bayesian baselines empirically.

Conclusion: Meta-learning is a scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal inference, adaptable to future challenges.

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

### [205] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning with InterpoLated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05527)
*Michalis Korakakis,Andreas Vlachos,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) mitigates shortcut reliance in models by interpolating representations of majority and minority examples, improving generalization without sacrificing majority accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERM models exploit spurious correlations (shortcuts) in training data, harming minority generalization. Existing methods are limited in scope, tuning difficulty, and computational cost.

Method: InterpoLL interpolates representations of majority examples with features from minority examples, weakening shortcut influence and improving feature learning.

Result: InterpoLL outperforms ERM and state-of-the-art methods in minority generalization across various architectures, maintaining majority accuracy.

Conclusion: InterpoLL is a broadly applicable, effective solution for mitigating shortcuts and improving model generalization.

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

*Sanaz Kazemi Abharian,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GBFA, a layer-aware bit-flip fault attack targeting GNNs, showing significant accuracy degradation with minimal bit flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware-based security challenges in GNNs are overlooked, prompting investigation into vulnerability to fault attacks.

Method: GBFA uses a Markov model for layer prediction and gradient ranking for bit selection, flipping minimal bits to degrade performance.

Result: GBFA reduces GraphSAGE's accuracy by 17% on Cora with one bit flip, demonstrating layer-specific vulnerability.

Conclusion: Layer-aware attacks like GBFA highlight critical security risks in GNN hardware implementations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

### [207] [Theoretical Learning Performance of Graph Neural Networks: The Impact of Jumping Connections and Layer-wise Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05533)
*Jiawei Sun,Hongkang Li,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the generalization guarantees of GCNs with jumping connections and graph sparsification, showing that sparsification maintains performance if essential edges are preserved, and reveals layer-specific sparsification requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of GCNs ignore either graph sparsification or jumping connections, leaving a gap in theoretical understanding of their combined impact on generalization.

Method: The study conducts learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping connections using graph sparsification, focusing on the sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$.

Result: Generalization accuracy approximates the highest achievable accuracy when $A^*$ preserves essential edges. Jumping connections lead to layer-specific sparsification needs, with the first layer's deviations from $A^*$ more critical.

Conclusion: Graph sparsification maintains generalization if essential edges are preserved, and jumping connections introduce layer-specific sparsification requirements, validated on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

TL;DR: LSC-GNN improves GNN performance on noisy graphs by using external clean links and penalizing discrepancies between embeddings from full and regularization graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with noisy edges, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes LSC-GNN, which trains two encoders (full graph and regularization graph) and penalizes latent representation discrepancies to avoid overfitting noisy edges.

Result: LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs on benchmark datasets, especially in moderately noisy graphs. It also works well in heterogeneous graphs like protein-metabolite networks.

Conclusion: LSC-GNN enhances predictive performance and interpretability in noisy relational structures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

*Jingyi Gao,Sol Lim,Seokhyun Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning framework for ergonomic risk assessment, improving load estimation by incorporating auxiliary gait data and carrying style, without needing manual labels during deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for load estimation from gait data lack generalization and accuracy due to reliance on direct mappings. This study aims to enhance predictive performance by integrating additional information like baseline gait and carrying style.

Method: The framework uses deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks and bi-directional cross-attention to fuse loaded and unloaded gait patterns. It eliminates the need for carrying style labels at inference time.

Result: Experiments with real-world data show significant accuracy improvements from using auxiliary information and effective fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances load estimation accuracy by leveraging auxiliary gait data and advanced fusion techniques, demonstrating the value of domain knowledge in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

TL;DR: Multitask Preplay is a novel algorithm that replays experience on one task to simulate unpursued tasks, improving human-like generalization and transfer learning in AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans leverage experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other accessible but unpursued tasks, suggesting a scalable method for multitask learning.

Method: The Multitask Preplay algorithm replays experience on one task as a starting point for counterfactual simulation of unpursued tasks, learning predictive representations for adaptive performance.

Result: Multitask Preplay outperforms traditional methods in predicting human generalization and improves AI agent performance in novel environments like Craftax.

Conclusion: Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory for human-like counterfactual learning and enhances AI multitask performance.

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and

TL;DR: A model-free reinforcement learning approach using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is introduced for in situ training of diffractive optical processors, improving convergence and performance without needing system modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimizing diffractive optical networks due to hardware imperfections and noise motivates the need for efficient in situ training methods.

Method: Utilizes PPO for in situ training, reusing measurement data and constraining policy updates for stable convergence.

Result: Validated experimentally across tasks like energy focusing, holography, aberration correction, and image classification, showing better performance.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable framework for optical systems, handling real-world imperfections without prior modeling.

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early
graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph
neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable
architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,
explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of
graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is
significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships
that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting
real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to
recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like
scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and
trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey
provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key
dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,
and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for
efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal
dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph
samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We

### [216] [FACT: the Features At Convergence Theorem for neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05644)
*Enric Boix-Adsera,Neil Mallinar,James B. Simon,Mikhail Belkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Features at Convergence Theorem (FACT), a self-consistency equation for neural network weights under weight decay, and validates it empirically. It also presents FACT-RFM, a modified learning algorithm that mimics neural network feature learning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks learn and represent features, especially under weight decay, and to develop a theoretical framework for feature learning.

Method: Proves the FACT theorem, validates it empirically, and modifies Recursive Feature Machines (RFM) to create FACT-RFM, a new learning algorithm.

Result: FACT-RFM achieves high performance on tabular data and replicates feature learning behaviors like grokking and phase transitions.

Conclusion: FACT provides a theoretical foundation for feature learning in neural networks, and FACT-RFM demonstrates practical applications of this theory.

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing between neurological and orthopedic gait impairments in dogs, which is difficult even for experienced clinicians.

Method: Developed a deep learning model using inertial sensor data, optimizing performance and generalizability. Variations in sensor setups and model architectures were explored.

Result: Achieved 96% accuracy in multiclass classification (healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in binary classification (healthy/non-healthy) on unseen dogs.

Conclusion: Inertial-based deep learning models show promise as a practical and objective tool for gait assessment in veterinary diagnostics.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system design for efficient Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) integration, addressing client-expert alignment challenges to improve scalability and privacy in large-scale AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for privacy-preserving, scalable training of large AI models on decentralized data, hindered by system-level challenges in FL and MoE integration.

Method: Conceptual system design with dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling.

Result: Improved scalability, efficiency, and robustness in training, with fewer communication rounds for convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed design enables widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured models in edge computing with high communication efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoTriton is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based model for optimizing Triton programming, achieving performance comparable to mainstream large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of Triton programming parameters is time-consuming and limits performance. AutoTriton aims to automate this process.

Method: Uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize Triton programming.

Result: AutoTriton matches performance of models like Claude-4-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1-0528, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: AutoTriton demonstrates RL's potential for automating high-performance kernel generation, enhancing AI system efficiency.

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MobileGUI-RL is a scalable framework for training GUI agents online, addressing limitations of offline methods like overfitting and brittleness. It uses self-exploration, task filtering, and adapted GRPO for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents trained offline face scalability issues, overfitting, and poor generalization to unseen environments. MobileGUI-RL aims to overcome these by enabling online training.

Method: MobileGUI-RL synthesizes tasks via self-exploration and filtering, and adapts GRPO with trajectory-aware advantages and composite rewards for GUI navigation.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show consistent improvements, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MobileGUI-RL offers a scalable and robust solution for training GUI agents online, outperforming offline methods.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hongbao Li,Ziye Jia,Sijie He,Kun Guo,Qihui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-layer UAV-assisted edge computing architecture is proposed to optimize system delay and energy consumption by integrating heterogeneous resources and using a hierarchical offloading scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies lack coordination of heterogeneous computing resources and adaptability to dynamic network conditions in vehicular networks.

Method: A dual-layer architecture combines high-altitude UAVs for relay and low-altitude UAVs for computing. A joint optimization problem is solved using a Markov decision process and a hierarchical offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm.

Result: Simulations show the method outperforms baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and convergence speed, with strong robustness in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture and hierarchical scheme effectively address the challenges of UAV-assisted edge computing in vehicular networks.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate high-resolution atmospheric forecasting with longer lead times faces bottlenecks in accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth due to large neural networks and data samples.

Method: Introduces WeatherMixer for linear workload scaling and Jigsaw for model parallelization using domain and tensor parallelism to eliminate memory redundancy.

Result: Achieves peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs, with 68% and 72% scaling efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art in compute-communication-limited and I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.

Conclusion: WeatherMixer and Jigsaw enable efficient, scalable AI-based atmospheric forecasting, addressing key computational challenges.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning and physics-informed method for cardiac disease diagnosis, achieving high accuracy in image registration and disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac diseases are a major global health issue, necessitating accurate diagnostic tools. The study aims to improve diagnosis by combining deep learning with biomechanical modeling.

Method: The approach integrates deep learning image registration with Neo-Hookean material modeling for cardiac tissue deformations. It uses feature extraction and five classification algorithms for disease diagnosis.

Result: High Dice scores (0.945 for left ventricle) and 98-100% classification accuracy were achieved on the ACDC dataset.

Conclusion: The method enhances diagnostic accuracy and transparency, supporting personalized patient care through explainable AI.

Abstract: Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this
study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining time series prediction with adapted flux balance analysis (FBA) to predict dynamic graph structures, addressing limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph prediction methods assume static vertices, which is unrealistic for dynamic networks like telecommunication or transport systems.

Method: The approach adapts flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method, to incorporate constraints for growing graphs and combines it with time series prediction.

Result: Empirical tests on synthetic (Preferential Attachment model) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) show the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully predicts dynamic graph structures, overcoming limitations of static vertex assumptions.

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack rigor in assessing LLMs' physics capabilities, which require deep conceptual understanding and modeling skills.

Method: ABench-Physics includes Phy_A (400 static problems) and Phy_B (100 dynamic problems with automatic variation).

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show significant gaps in physical reasoning, especially in dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics offers a robust framework to advance LLMs' scientific reasoning by addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific

*Marco Roschkowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soup-Adapter, an ensemble method for few-shot domain adaptation, improving performance and robustness by averaging outputs of multiple adapters trained with diverse hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hyperparameter tuning impracticality and model robustness under distribution shifts in few-shot domain adaptation.

Method: Train multiple independent adapters with diverse hyperparameters, average their outputs, and reparameterize into a single adapter (Soup-Adapter).

Result: Higher performance and robustness compared to individual adapters, with reduced sensitivity to critical hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter effectively solves the two problems and is the first to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework and tool (BAGEL) extends concept-based interpretability to mechanistic interpretability, enabling global analysis of semantic concepts in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond local explanations and provide a global understanding of how semantic concepts emerge and interact in models, addressing dataset biases and enhancing trustworthiness.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic framework and visualization tool (BAGEL) that quantifies concept representation across layers and visualizes latent circuits and information flow.

Result: Reveals latent circuits and concept-class relationships, aiding in identifying spurious correlations and improving model trustworthiness.

Conclusion: The framework advances mechanistic interpretability, offering scalable insights into model generalization and biases.

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairDG, addressing both domain generalization and algorithmic fairness, and proposes PAFDG for optimizing utility-fairness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness, as current methods focus on one without considering the other.

Method: Derives mutual information-based bounds for risk and fairness, then introduces PAFDG, a Pareto-optimal framework for FairDG.

Result: PAFDG outperforms existing methods in balancing utility and fairness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FairDG is effectively addressed by PAFDG, offering a practical solution for domain shifts and fairness in unseen domains.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

*Samuel Ofosu Mensah,Kerol Djoumessi,Philipp Berens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated learning framework using prototypes and lightweight adapters to address communication overhead and statistical heterogeneity, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in federated learning (FL) like communication overhead and statistical heterogeneity while maintaining privacy and interpretability.

Method: Proposes an FL framework with prototype-based interpretations and lightweight adapter modules for local model refinement and reduced communication.

Result: Improved accuracy in classification tasks on a retinal fundus image dataset, with inherent interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces communication load, handles statistical heterogeneity, and provides interpretable results.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in power system state estimation, such as speed, accuracy, and security under faulty conditions or cyber-attacks.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using PINNs, embedding physical laws into neural networks to enhance estimation accuracy and robustness.

Result: Achieves up to 83% higher accuracy on unseen data and 65% better performance on new datasets; 93% more accurate during data manipulation attacks.

Conclusion: PINNs offer a promising solution for accurate and robust power system state estimation, even under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and
real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under
faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and
robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into
the neural network architecture, PINNs improve estimation accuracy for
transmission grid applications under both normal and faulty conditions, while
also showing potential in addressing security concerns such as data
manipulation attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data
manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to
93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.

*Astrid Franz,Frederik Hoppe,Marianne Michaelis,Udo Göbel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for task-independent embeddings of tabular data using graph structures and Graph Auto-Encoders, enabling downstream tasks without predefined targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data in relational databases is widely used but lacks predefined tasks, necessitating universal embeddings for flexible analysis.

Method: Transform tabular data into a graph, use Graph Auto-Encoders for entity embeddings, and aggregate for row embeddings. Enables embedding of unseen samples.

Result: Outperforms existing universal tabular data embedding techniques in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible and effective solution for embedding tabular data, supporting various downstream tasks without retraining.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

*Chenhao Li,Marco Hutter,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based approaches in learning from demonstrations, highlighting trade-offs in reward functions and policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the strengths and limitations of feature-based and GAN-based methods for learning from demonstrations, focusing on reward function design and policy learning implications.

Method: Comparative analysis of feature-based (dense, interpretable rewards) and GAN-based (implicit, scalable supervision) approaches, emphasizing structured motion representations.

Result: Feature-based methods excel in high-fidelity motion imitation but struggle with generalization; GAN-based methods offer scalability but face training instability.

Conclusion: The choice between paradigms depends on task-specific priorities (fidelity, diversity, interpretability, adaptability), with no clear dominance of one over the other.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

*Rui Huang,Shitong Shao,Zikai Zhou,Pukun Zhao,Hangyu Guo,Tian Ye,Lichen Bai,Shuo Yang,Zeke Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C), a method to reduce the resource-intensive training of diffusion models by creating a synthetic sub-dataset with fewer samples, achieving high-quality results with less data and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion models is resource-heavy, requiring large datasets and extensive computation. The study aims to address this by condensing datasets for efficient training.

Method: Proposes D2C, a two-phase framework: Select (identifies a diverse subset using diffusion difficulty scores) and Attach (enhances the subset with semantic and visual representations).

Result: D2C enables 100x faster training with only 0.8% of data, achieving a FID score of 4.3 in 40k steps for SiT-XL/2.

Conclusion: D2C effectively reduces training costs while maintaining high visual quality, offering a practical solution for resource-efficient diffusion model training.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

TL;DR: The study addresses label noise in canine heart sound classification, using multiple expert opinions to reduce noise and improve AI model performance, with XGBoost showing the most significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in veterinary medicine, especially in canine auscultation data, negatively impacts AI model training and classification performance.

Method: A dataset of 140 heart sound recordings was annotated by experts, selecting 70 high-quality recordings to reduce noise. Three algorithms (AdaBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest) were trained and evaluated.

Result: XGBoost outperformed others, with sensitivity and specificity improvements across all murmur categories (e.g., mild murmurs: sensitivity 37.71% to 90.98%, specificity 76.70% to 93.69%).

Conclusion: Reducing label noise significantly enhances classification accuracy, particularly for detecting canine heart murmurs, with XGBoost being the most effective algorithm.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart
sound classification, label noise reduction, machine learning, XGBoost,

### [235] [Simple Convergence Proof of Adam From a Sign-like Descent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05966)
*Hanyang Peng,Shuang Qin,Yue Yu,Fangqing Jiang,Hui Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new interpretation of Adam as a sign-like optimizer, simplifying its convergence analysis and proving an optimal convergence rate under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical analyses of Adam are complex and rely on strong assumptions, making them hard to verify and extend. The paper aims to provide a simpler and more intuitive understanding of Adam's convergence.

Method: The authors reformulate Adam as a sign-like optimizer, enabling a streamlined convergence analysis under mild assumptions like generalized p-affine variance and (L0, L1, q)-smoothness.

Result: The paper proves Adam achieves an optimal convergence rate of O(1/T^(1/4)), improving upon previous results, and highlights the role of momentum in ensuring convergence.

Conclusion: The new interpretation simplifies Adam's theoretical analysis, offers practical tuning guidelines, and bridges the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN) is introduced to model groundwater flow with heat transport, combining local and global processes for efficient and accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles with real-world applications due to limited or low-quality data, and classical simulations are costly for groundwater flow with heat transport.

Method: LGCNN combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for global transport with CNNs for local groundwater velocity and heat diffusion.

Result: The model successfully predicts city-wide subsurface temperature fields and scales to larger areas without retraining.

Conclusion: LGCNN offers a computationally efficient and accurate solution for modeling complex groundwater flow and heat transport.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs are efficient for long sequences but lack exploration of QAT's impact on edge hardware, especially AIMC chips.

Method: Applied QAT to SSMs, analyzed model size vs. precision, and tested robustness to analog noise and pruning.

Result: QAT reduced SSM complexity by up to two orders of magnitude and improved deployment on AIMC substrates.

Conclusion: QAT optimizes SSMs for edge hardware, balancing performance and resource constraints effectively.

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

TL;DR: CoRE enables label-free self-evaluation for large reasoning models (LRMs) to reduce redundant reasoning steps, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs exhibit overthinking—excessive reasoning steps—which introduces inefficiencies. The goal is to enable autonomous self-evaluation without external labels.

Method: Proposes Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding (CoRE) to analyze reasoning trajectories in latent space. Introduces CoRE-Eval, a training-free framework to detect redundant reasoning and terminate early.

Result: CoRE-Eval reduces reasoning steps by 13.7%-33.2% and improves accuracy by ~10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on AIME with a 32B model.

Conclusion: CoRE enhances LRM metacognition, improving reasoning efficiency and accuracy without additional training or labels.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

TL;DR: UARL is a safe RL framework that avoids direct target domain interaction by using uncertainty-aware training and progressive randomization in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and robustness in RL deployment without direct target domain interaction due to risks like distribution shifts and impracticality.

Method: Uses an ensemble of critics for uncertainty quantification and progressive environmental randomization in simulations.

Result: Effective OOD detection, improved performance, and sample efficiency in MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot.

Conclusion: UARL safely enhances RL policy robustness and generalization without direct target domain training.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO-SAH is a zeroth-order optimization method using subspace-based Hessian approximation for faster convergence with fewer function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-free optimization is needed where gradients are impractical, but existing methods lack efficiency due to high costs of Hessian estimation.

Method: ZO-SAH estimates Hessians in 2D subspaces by fitting quadratics and reuses evaluations via periodic subspace-switching.

Result: ZO-SAH outperforms existing zeroth-order methods in convergence speed on benchmarks like logistic regression and DNN training.

Conclusion: ZO-SAH efficiently incorporates second-order information, reducing function-query costs while accelerating convergence.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of missing or weakly connected links in large, sparse, and noisy scientific literature networks, particularly for materials like TMDs, by uncovering hidden associations.

Method: Combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk), Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk), and Logistic matrix factorization (LMF) with automatic model selection to construct a topic tree and predict links.

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

*Daniel Haider,Vincent Lostanlen,Martin Ehler,Nicki Holighaus,Peter Balazs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, proposes frame-theoretic methods to ensure Parseval stability, and derives efficient optimization objectives to suppress aliasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aliasing in convolutional layers affects numerical stability and generalization, but a general analysis of its effects and stability bounds is lacking.

Method: A frame-theoretic approach is adapted to analyze aliasing, derive stability bounds, and propose optimization objectives for Parseval stability.

Result: Practical stability bounds and efficient optimization objectives are derived, along with closed-form expressions for aliasing effects in random kernels.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into aliasing behavior and offers practical methods to enhance stability in convolutional layers.

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method optimizes connections in Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs), outperforming fixed-connection LGNs with fewer gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve performance and reduce the number of logic gates in LGNs by optimizing connections.

Method: Uses a probability distribution to select high-merit connections per gate input, followed by gate-type selection.

Result: Achieves over 98% on MNIST with 8000 gates and 24x fewer gates than standard LGNs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a pathway to fully trainable Boolean logic with efficient, high-performing LGNs.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in
Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a
probability distribution over a subset of connections per gate input, selecting
the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection
LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only
a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting differential design techniques from Transformers to Mamba, a selective state-space model, to mitigate attention overallocation. A novel differential mechanism for Mamba is introduced, showing improved performance and retrieval capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to irrelevant context, degrading performance. The paper investigates if differential design, effective in Transformers, can be applied to Mamba.

Method: The authors propose a novel differential mechanism for Mamba, requiring architectural modifications, and validate it on language modeling benchmarks.

Result: The adapted Mamba shows improved retrieval capabilities and outperforms vanilla Mamba, effectively mitigating attention overallocation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that differential design can be successfully adapted to Mamba, enhancing its performance and addressing the overallocation issue.

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

as Transformers and Diffusion Models. These connections open up possibilities
for interpreting the computation of traditional AI networks through the
theoretical lens of Associative Memories. Additionally, novel Lagrangian
formulations of these networks make it possible to design powerful distributed
models that learn useful representations and inform the design of novel
architectures. This tutorial provides an approachable introduction to

TL;DR: The paper proposes neural network-based methods to optimize the activation of pinching antennas in waveguides for maximizing communication rates, accounting for user location uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for flexible, energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies in evolving wireless communication systems drives the exploration of pinching antennas (PAs).

Method: The problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. Neural networks of varying complexity are used to learn activation policies from data, incorporating spatial features and signal structure, while accounting for user location uncertainty.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed models are effective and robust in optimizing PA activation for communication rate maximization.

Conclusion: The neural network-based approach successfully addresses the complex PA activation problem, demonstrating practicality for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TuneShield is a defense framework for mitigating toxicity in chatbot fine-tuning, using LLM-based toxicity classification and synthetic 'healing data' to preserve conversational quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of toxicity in chatbot customization, especially with untrusted training data.

Method: Leverages LLM-based toxicity classification and generates synthetic 'healing data' to mitigate toxicity during fine-tuning.

Result: Effectively mitigates toxicity injection attacks and preserves conversational quality, even with imperfect classifiers.

Conclusion: TuneShield is resilient against adaptive attacks and effective in dialog-based learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, such as LLMs, have revolutionized
conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing
LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during
this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,
remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a
defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning
while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based
toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and
safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming
industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,
termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to
mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It
performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing
desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates
toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when
the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be
resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,
TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection
attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

TL;DR: A survey on model extraction attacks and defenses for language models, covering attack types, methodologies, defenses, and evaluation metrics, with insights into limitations and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security threats to language models, such as intellectual property and privacy risks, by analyzing extraction attacks and defenses.

Method: Taxonomy of attacks (functionality, training data, prompt-targeted) and defenses (model protection, data privacy, prompt strategies), with evaluation metrics.

Result: Identified limitations in current approaches and proposed future directions like integrated attacks and adaptive defenses.

Conclusion: Provides a resource for NLP, ML, and security professionals to protect deployed language models.

Abstract: Model extraction attacks pose significant security threats to deployed
language models, potentially compromising intellectual property and user
privacy. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific
extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality
extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze
various attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct
querying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit
transformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into
model protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies,
evaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We
propose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and
defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language
models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current
approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated
attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with
model utility. This work serves NLP researchers, ML engineers, and security
professionals seeking to protect language models in production environments.

### [253] [Disappearing Ink: Obfuscation Breaks N-gram Code Watermarks in Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05512)
*Gehao Zhang,Eugene Bagdasarian,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of N-gram-based watermarking schemes against code obfuscation, proving their vulnerability and suggesting a path for robust watermarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code for tasks like authorship attribution and misuse detection, and the lack of robust evaluation of watermarking schemes against sophisticated attacks like obfuscation.

Method: Formal modeling of code obfuscation and theoretical proof of N-gram-based watermarking's vulnerability, supported by experiments on three watermarking schemes, two LLMs, two programming languages, four benchmarks, and four obfuscators.

Result: All watermarking detectors failed against obfuscation (AUROC ~0.5), with no scheme achieving AUROC >0.6 post-attack.

Conclusion: N-gram-based watermarking is not robust against obfuscation; the paper suggests a potential path for developing more robust watermarking techniques.

Abstract: Distinguishing AI-generated code from human-written code is becoming crucial
for tasks such as authorship attribution, content tracking, and misuse
detection. Based on this, N-gram-based watermarking schemes have emerged as
prominent, which inject secret watermarks to be detected during the generation.
  However, their robustness in code content remains insufficiently evaluated.
Most claims rely solely on defenses against simple code transformations or code
optimizations as a simulation of attack, creating a questionable sense of
robustness. In contrast, more sophisticated schemes already exist in the
software engineering world, e.g., code obfuscation, which significantly alters
code while preserving functionality. Although obfuscation is commonly used to
protect intellectual property or evade software scanners, the robustness of
code watermarking techniques against such transformations remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we formally model the code obfuscation and prove the
impossibility of N-gram-based watermarking's robustness with only one intuitive
and experimentally verified assumption, distribution consistency, satisfied.
Given the original false positive rate of the watermarking detection, the ratio
that the detector failed on the watermarked code after obfuscation will
increase to 1 - fpr.
  The experiments have been performed on three SOTA watermarking schemes, two
LLMs, two programming languages, four code benchmarks, and four obfuscators.
Among them, all watermarking detectors show coin-flipping detection abilities
on obfuscated codes (AUROC tightly surrounds 0.5). Among all models,
watermarking schemes, and datasets, both programming languages own obfuscators
that can achieve attack effects with no detection AUROC higher than 0.6 after
the attack. Based on the theoretical and practical observations, we also
proposed a potential path of robust code watermarking.

*Shuo Shao,Yiming Li,Mengren Zheng,Zhiyang Hu,Yukun Chen,Boheng Li,Yu He,Junfeng Guo,Tianwei Zhang,Dacheng Tao,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates dataset auditing methods' resilience against adversarial attacks, introduces a taxonomy, proposes attack strategies, and benchmarks their effectiveness, revealing current methods' vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparency and privacy concerns in dataset usage for deep learning by assessing the robustness of auditing techniques against adversarial attacks.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy for auditing methods, formulates evasion and forgery attacks, proposes systematic attack strategies, and benchmarks them using DATABench.

Result: Current auditing methods are insufficiently robust under adversarial attacks, highlighting vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Urgent need for more secure and reliable dataset auditing methods to withstand adversarial manipulation.

Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges
critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the
common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and
copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a
specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising
solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed
various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial
attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a
comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial
perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing
methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the
data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).
Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed
to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely
implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods
and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:
decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based
methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new
benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9
representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal
that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or
distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent
need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable
of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at

*Sarthak Choudhary,Divyam Anshumaan,Nils Palumbo,Somesh Jha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper exposes a vulnerability in the KAD defense against prompt injection attacks on LLMs, introducing an adaptive attack method called DataFlip that bypasses KAD with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural vulnerability in KAD defenses, which are currently used to protect LLMs from prompt injection attacks.

Method: The authors formally analyze the KAD framework, identify its weakness, and design DataFlip, an adaptive attack method that exploits this flaw without requiring white-box access or optimization.

Result: DataFlip achieves detection rates as low as 1.5% and malicious behavior success rates up to 88%, demonstrating KAD's inefficacy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for more robust defenses against prompt injection attacks, as KAD's structural vulnerability can be easily exploited.

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection
attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly
benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses
based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect
performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In
this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural
vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We
design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this
fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates
as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates
of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any
optimization procedures.

*Kaixiang Zhao,Joseph Yousry Attalla,Qian Lou,Yushun Dong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DESIGN is a framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference using server-side input graph pruning and adaptive polynomial activation under FHE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FHE GNN approaches suffer from high computational overhead and overlook input data redundancy, making real-time privacy-preserving inference impractical.

Method: DESIGN uses hierarchical optimization: computing FHE-compatible node importance scores, homomorphic partitioning, and adaptive polynomial activation based on node importance.

Result: DESIGN significantly accelerates FHE GNN inference while maintaining competitive model accuracy.

Conclusion: DESIGN provides a robust solution for efficient and secure graph analytics under FHE.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs
in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and
privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN
(EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel
framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical
efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook
input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework
achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization
strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance
scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted
graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating
multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated
mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant
elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation
complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy,
presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics.

### [257] [AI Agent Smart Contract Exploit Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05558)
*Arthur Gervais,Liyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A1 is an agentic system that autonomously generates exploits for smart contracts using LLMs, achieving a 62.96% success rate on real-world contracts and extracting millions in value. It reveals an asymmetry favoring attackers over defenders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate vulnerability discovery in smart contracts without hand-crafted heuristics, leveraging LLMs for exploit generation and validation.

Method: A1 uses six domain-specific tools for autonomous vulnerability discovery, iteratively refining strategies based on execution feedback. It validates outputs to eliminate false positives.

Result: A1 achieved a 62.96% success rate on the VERITE benchmark, identified 9 additional vulnerabilities, and extracted up to 8.59 million USD per case. Monte Carlo analysis showed 85.9%-88.8% success probabilities.

Conclusion: A1 demonstrates high effectiveness in exploit generation but highlights a troubling asymmetry where attackers benefit more than defenders, raising ethical concerns about AI agents in cybersecurity.

Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM
into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and
provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous
vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to
understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on
blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All
outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and
Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the
VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional
vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's
training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59
million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across
six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns
with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations
2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo
analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8%
without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying
A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's
o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100%
vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to
break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability
rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a $6000 exploit
value, while defenders require $60000, raising fundamental questions about
whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

### [258] [Automated Reasoning for Vulnerability Management by Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05794)
*Avi Shaked,Nan Messe*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism for systematic vulnerability management in system designs, integrated into an open-source tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches lack systematic reasoning for vulnerability postures in system designs, necessitating a more effective method.

Method: A formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism is developed and integrated into a security design tool.

Result: The mechanism enables designers to identify vulnerabilities, specify mitigations, and manage postures systematically.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances vulnerability management by supporting systematic reasoning and control design in system security.

Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture
and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to
proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security
controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do
not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems
designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we
propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the
mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its
application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges.
The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify
vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly
specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus
systematically manage vulnerability postures.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores using Generative AI (GenAI) to address data challenges in security classifiers, showing significant performance improvements (up to 32.6%) through synthetic data augmentation, but notes limitations in certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data challenges in security classifiers are understudied, and the paper investigates whether GenAI can mitigate these issues and enhance performance.

Method: The study proposes augmenting training datasets with synthetic data from GenAI, evaluating 6 methods and introducing a novel scheme (Nimai) across 7 security tasks.

Result: GenAI improves classifier performance by up to 32.6%, aids in adapting to concept drift, but struggles with initialization in some tasks and specific task characteristics.

Conclusion: GenAI holds promise for security tasks, but future tools must address identified limitations to maximize effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine learning-based supervised classifiers are widely used for security
tasks, and their improvement has been largely focused on algorithmic
advancements. We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the
performance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address
the following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI)
address these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose
augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI
techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach
across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and
introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data
synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the
performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even
in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to
concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment
process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to
initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify
characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class
distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using
GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI
tools designed for security tasks.

*Jungeun Lim,Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen,Xixi Lu,Jan Mendling,Minseok Song*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline combining anonymization and event data partitioning to balance privacy and utility in event logs, showing improved utility for process discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of preserving privacy in event logs while retaining utility for process discovery, especially in complex logs where anonymization reduces utility.

Method: A pipeline integrating anonymization with event data partitioning, using event abstraction to segment logs for separate anonymization.

Result: Event partitioning improves utility for directly-follows-based anonymization techniques, validated on real-world logs and process discovery methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively balances privacy and utility in event logs, enhancing process discovery outcomes.

Abstract: Information systems support the execution of business processes. The event
logs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about
customers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be
addressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for
process discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the
higher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by
anonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization
and event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for
partitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into
multiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This
pipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate
our approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization
techniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery
techniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring
improvements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based

*Xiaohu Li,Yunfeng Ning,Zepeng Bao,Mayi Xu,Jianhao Chen,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A framework combining attack and defense for LLM security, using GANs to learn security boundaries, achieving high success rates in jailbreak attacks and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in LLM security mechanisms revealed by jailbreak attacks and improve protection.

Method: Utilizes GANs to learn the security judgment boundary in LLMs, leveraging linearly separable embeddings and harmful problem transfer.

Result: Achieves 88.85% jailbreak success rate and 84.17% defense success rate on state-of-the-art datasets.

Conclusion: Validates the approach's effectiveness, provides insights into LLM security, and enhances model safety.

Abstract: Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the
protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods
reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have
isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection
mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense.
Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate
layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to
embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize
generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary
inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The
experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak
success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success
rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%.
This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light
on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for
enhancing model security The code and data are available at

*Kuan-Cheng Chen,Huan-Hsin Tseng,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Chen-Yu Liu,Kin K. Leung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: SUN-VQC is a variational quantum circuit architecture using symmetry-restricted Lie subgroups to avoid barren plateaus and improve gradient signals, enabling faster convergence and higher fidelities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of barren plateaus in hardware-efficient ansatzes by confining evolution to a compact subspace, reducing computational complexity.

Method: Uses single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup (SU(2^k)) to limit the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension, with hardware-compatible gradients via a generalized parameter-shift rule.

Result: SUN-VQCs show larger gradient signals, faster convergence (2-3x), and higher fidelities compared to depth-matched alternatives.

Conclusion: Lie-subalgebra engineering offers a scalable, principled approach to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs for near-term quantum processors.

Abstract: We propose SUN-VQC, a variational-circuit architecture whose elementary
layers are single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup,
$\mathrm{SU}(2^{k}) \subset \mathrm{SU}(2^{n})$ with $k \ll n$. Confining the
evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension
from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial
suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague
hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained
using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and
finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and
classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient
signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than
depth-matched Pauli-rotation or hardware-efficient circuits. These results
demonstrate that Lie-subalgebra engineering provides a principled, scalable
route to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs compatible with near-term quantum
processors.

### [263] [Learnable quantum spectral filters for hybrid graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05640)
*Ammar Daskin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A parameterized quantum circuit mimics convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks, using quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Laplacian operator connections, achieving exponential compression and competitive performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum circuits for efficient graph signal processing, avoiding costly classical computations like Chebyshev polynomial or Taylor expansions.

Method: The circuit uses QFT-based connections derived from the Laplacian operator, approximating its eigenspace with polynomial-depth circuits. It outputs an n-dimensional probability vector for graph signals, combined with classical neural networks for prediction.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance than baselines on graph classification tasks, especially where geometric structure is important, using minimal parameters (1-100 quantum, 1000-5000 classical).

Conclusion: The proposed quantum circuit offers an efficient alternative to classical methods for graph neural networks, demonstrating strong performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the optimal copy complexity for quantum state certification with fully entangled measurements, showing it scales with the worst-case complexity times the fidelity between the hypothesis state and the maximally mixed state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine instance-optimal bounds for quantum state certification when testers can perform fully entangled measurements, a problem previously open.

Method: Proves bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method, extending prior work on unentangled measurements.

Result: The optimal copy complexity is the worst-case complexity times the fidelity between the hypothesis state and the maximally mixed state.

Conclusion: The work closes the gap in understanding instance-optimal bounds for quantum state certification with fully entangled measurements and introduces a method likely useful for other problems.

Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a
hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a
tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in
trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are
necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled
measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for
a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is
for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal
bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the
tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],
they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements
they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for
quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled
measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal
copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity
times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our
lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,
which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to
recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],
i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple
proof.

### [265] [Integrators at War: Mediating in AI-assisted Resort-to-Force Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06861)
*Dennis Müller,Maurice Chiodo,Mitja Sienknecht*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines the role of integrators in military AI systems, highlighting challenges in human-machine teaming for resort-to-force decisions and offering policy solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked role of integrators in military AI systems and their challenges in linking developers and users within sociotechnical systems.

Method: 1. Conceptualize actor-AI relationships as sociotechnical systems. 2. Identify challenges in human-machine teaming (technology, integrator role, interaction). 3. Provide policy recommendations.

Result: Identified challenges include technology limitations, integrator role complexities, and human-machine interaction issues.

Conclusion: Policy recommendations are proposed to improve AI integration in resort-to-force decision-making, emphasizing the integrator's critical role.

Abstract: The integration of AI systems into the military domain is changing the way
war-related decisions are made. It binds together three disparate groups of
actors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between
these groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and
system structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often
neglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex
human-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the
disparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system.
To act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other
groups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and
shortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF)
decision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed
in three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different
groups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify
challenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We
focus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the
integrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine
interaction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these
shortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores trade-offs between legal responsibility and AI explainability in Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups, formalizes HITL types, and critiques legal frameworks for overlooking effective setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the variability in legal compliance and safety of HITL setups and highlight the trade-off between legal responsibility and AI explainability.

Method: Uses computability theory (oracle machines) to formalize HITL setups, presents a taxonomy of failure modes, and critiques UK/EU legal frameworks.

Result: Identifies gaps in legal frameworks, suggests better responsibility assignment, and highlights uncontrollable HITL failures.

Conclusion: HITL setups involve complex design choices and uncontrollable failures, requiring informed decisions by AI developers and lawmakers.

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups
for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing
between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between
the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.
We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to
formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human
monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction
between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one
reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL
failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL
setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and
EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always
achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest
areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups
and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and
unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve
many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often
out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the
challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers
and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper highlights systemic risks from AI and algorithmic interactions, proposing policy solutions like transparency, registration, and monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of AI and autonomous systems introduces systemic risks from their interactions, which current governance frameworks fail to address.

Method: The paper outlines the challenge and suggests policy measures, including system registration, licensing, and enhanced monitoring.

Result: Current governance lacks visibility into algorithmic interactions, leading to risks like market crashes and public trust erosion.

Conclusion: Proposed solutions focus on transparency, accountability, and phased governance to mitigate systemic risks.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system
registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring
capabilities.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of assisting medical students with clinical reasoning during simulation-based training.

Method: Design and architecture of the FSA, leveraging a Fuzzy Inference System to interpret student interactions and provide context-aware feedback.

Result: The FSA offers scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in medical education simulations.

Conclusion: The FSA shows promise for enhancing clinical reasoning training; future work includes empirical evaluation and broader integration.

Abstract: Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical
scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This
paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA),
a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation
(MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to
continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents
(e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined
fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and
contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in
real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and
provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work
focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its
potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in
simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical
evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness and implementation of Hungary's National AI Strategy and identify areas for improvement.

Method: Analysis of strategic documents, financial records, and expert interviews, benchmarking against Singapore's AI strategies.

Result: EUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary, fragmented execution, and lack of financial transparency.

Conclusion: Recommendations include adapting to large language models, restructuring governance, and leveraging Hungary's position for AI experimentation.

Abstract: The study assesses Hungary's National AI Strategy and its implementation
through the analysis of strategic documents, publicly available financial
records, and expert interviews with the Hungarian AI Coalition President and
Chief Strategic Advisor to the Government Commissioner for AI. 22 goals from
Hungary's strategy were evaluated through conceptual, governance, temporal, and
financial dimensions before being benchmarked against Singapore's National AI
Strategies (NAIS 1.0 and NAIS 2.0). Key findings include an estimated total of
EUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available
financial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three
projects made up 98\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals
Hungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following
ministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews
since 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for
Hungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a
reference point. These include adapting to the era of large language models,
restructuring the existing triple helix network to foster more effective
dialogue and advocacy, and positioning the country as an East-West bridge for

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study evaluates a GenAI-powered workflow in a BIM course, finding students achieved learning goals but faced challenges like debugging AI code and inconsistent tool performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of Generative AI for BIM compliance tasks, an under-researched area, and assess its impact on student learning and workload.

Method: A classroom pilot with 55 students over two semesters, involving lectures on prompt engineering, AI-driven rule checking, and an assignment using an LLM for code violation detection in Revit. Surveys and interviews (NASA-TLX scale, regression analysis) assessed workload and learning.

Result: Students achieved learning objectives but struggled with debugging AI-generated code and tool inconsistency, leading to cognitive strain. Interest in future GenAI applications remained high with proper support.

Conclusion: While GenAI shows promise for BIM education, challenges like debugging and tool performance highlight the need for better instructional support and prompt engineering training.

Abstract: This study evaluates the implementation of a Generative AI-powered rule
checking workflow within a graduate-level Building Information Modeling (BIM)
course at a U.S. university. Over two semesters, 55 students participated in a
classroom-based pilot exploring the use of GenAI for BIM compliance tasks, an
area with limited prior research. The instructional design included lectures on
prompt engineering and AI-driven rule checking, followed by an assignment where
students used a large language model (LLM) to identify code violations in
designs using Autodesk Revit. Surveys and interviews were conducted to assess
student workload, learning effectiveness, and overall experience, using the
NASA-TLX scale and regression analysis. Findings indicate students generally
achieved learning objectives but faced challenges such as difficulties
debugging AI-generated code and inconsistent tool performance, probably due to
their limited prompt engineering experience. These issues increased cognitive
and emotional strain, especially among students with minimal programming
backgrounds. Despite these challenges, students expressed strong interest in
future GenAI applications, particularly with clear instructional support.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Smaller, fine-tuned language models outperform large LLMs like ChatGPT for explaining compiler errors in education, balancing cost and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs are impractical for widespread educational use due to computational cost and over-assistance, prompting the need for smaller, specialized alternatives.

Method: Fine-tuned three open-source models (Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-32B) on a 40,000-entry C compiler error dataset, evaluated via expert reviews and automated LLM-as-judge analysis.

Result: SFT enhances smaller models' pedagogical quality, matching larger models, with optimal trade-offs between size and performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning compact models on domain-specific data is effective for educational tools, offering a replicable method for broader AI adoption in education.

Abstract: Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher
cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale,
cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread
pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language
models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable
alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C
compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)
student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three
open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual
evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated
analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our
results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller
models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the
trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,
efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for
creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable
methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in
educational contexts.

TL;DR: AGACCI, a multi-agent system, improves accuracy and consistency in evaluating code-based assignments compared to single GPT-based models, leveraging specialized roles for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based methods struggle with complex educational tasks like programming assignments that require structured reasoning and clear evaluation criteria.

Method: AGACCI uses a multi-agent system with specialized roles to evaluate code-based assignments, tested on 360 graduate-level tasks annotated by experts.

Result: AGACCI outperforms single GPT-based models in rubric and feedback accuracy, relevance, consistency, and coherence, aligning with expert assessments.

Conclusion: AGACCI demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems for scalable, context-aware educational evaluation, though performance varies by task type.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted education have encouraged the integration of
vision-language models (VLMs) into academic assessment, particularly for tasks
that require both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, existing
VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as
programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that
require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation
criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes
specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy,
interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the
framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60
participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and
qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms
a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy,
relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional
intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies
across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for
scalable and context-aware educational evaluation.

TL;DR: Hidden prompts in arXiv manuscripts manipulated AI peer review, revealing vulnerabilities in academic evaluation systems and prompting calls for better policies and screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the use of hidden prompts in academic manuscripts as a form of research misconduct and expose vulnerabilities in AI-assisted peer review.

Method: Examined 18 arXiv manuscripts with hidden prompts, categorized the prompts, and evaluated defenses and publisher policies.

Result: Identified four types of hidden prompts, debunked the 'honeypot' defense, and highlighted inconsistent publisher policies.

Conclusion: The incident underscores the need for technical screening and harmonized policies to prevent AI manipulation in academic evaluation.

Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were
found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate
AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"
were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses
varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the
practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes
this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique
of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of
hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed
evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect
reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently
self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.
Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer
review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure
requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond
peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including
plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need
for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized
policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

Result: Findings reveal generative AI art contributes to carbon emissions, misinformation, copyright violations, and job losses, underscoring the need for regulation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that generative AI art requires proper legislation and regulation to mitigate its ethical and societal harms.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow daily, more exciting (and
somewhat controversial) technology emerges every other day. As we see the
advancements in AI, we see more and more people becoming skeptical of it. This
paper explores the complications and confusion around the ethics of generative
AI art. We delve deep into the ethical side of AI, specifically generative art.
We step back from the excitement and observe the impossible conundrums that
this impressive technology produces. Covering environmental consequences,
celebrity representation, intellectual property, deep fakes, and artist
displacement. Our research found that generative AI art is responsible for
increased carbon emissions, spreading misinformation, copyright infringement,
unlawful depiction, and job displacement. In light of this, we propose multiple
possible solutions for these problems. We address each situation's history,
cause, and consequences and offer different viewpoints. At the root of it all,
though, the central theme is that generative AI Art needs to be correctly
legislated and regulated.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a laser chaos-based multi-processing learning (LC-ML) method for stable acoustic relay assignment in underwater networks, achieving high throughput and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stable relay assignment in underwater acoustic networks, considering classical and ambiguous stable arrangements.

Method: Uses laser chaos-based random numbers and multi-processing learning to assign relays to source nodes efficiently.

Result: LC-ML improves throughput and adaptability, with ambiguous arrangements showing less volatility.

Conclusion: The method is practical for relay selection in complex underwater environments.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of stable acoustic relay assignment in an
underwater acoustic network. Unlike the objectives of most existing literature,
two distinct objectives, namely classical stable arrangement and ambiguous
stable arrangement, are considered. To achieve these stable arrangements, a
laser chaos-based multi-processing learning (LC-ML) method is introduced to
efficiently obtain high throughput and rapidly attain stability. In order to
sufficiently explore the relay's decision-making, this method uses random
numbers generated by laser chaos to learn the assignment of relays to multiple
source nodes. This study finds that the laser chaos-based random number and
multi-processing in the exchange process have a positive effect on higher
throughput and strong adaptability with environmental changing over time.
Meanwhile, ambiguous cognitions result in the stable configuration with less
volatility compared to accurate ones. This provides a practical and useful
method and can be the basis for relay selection in complex underwater
environments.

Result: The transformer model outperforms CNNs, achieving 47.99% (1-sec queries) and 97% (10-sec queries) in low noise, and 56.5% (15-sec queries) in heavy noise.

Conclusion: The proposed transformer-based model and evaluation protocol significantly improve song identification robustness in noisy environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in song identification leverage deep neural networks to learn
compact audio fingerprints directly from raw waveforms. While these methods
perform well under controlled conditions, their accuracy drops significantly in
real-world scenarios where the audio is captured via mobile devices in noisy
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol designed
to better reflect such real-world conditions. We generate three recordings of
the same audio, each with increasing levels of noise, captured using a mobile
device's microphone. Our results reveal a substantial performance drop for two
state-of-the-art CNN-based models under this protocol, compared to previously
reported benchmarks. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the
augmentation pipeline during training with contrastive loss. By introduction
low pass and high pass filters in the augmentation pipeline we significantly
increase the performance of both systems in our proposed evaluation.
Furthermore, we develop a transformer-based model with a tailored projection
module and demonstrate that transferring knowledge from a semantically relevant
domain yields a more robust solution. The transformer architecture outperforms
CNN-based models across all noise levels, and query durations. In low noise
conditions it achieves 47.99% for 1-sec queries, and 97% for 10-sec queries in
finding the correct song, surpassing by 14%, and by 18.5% the second-best
performing model, respectively, Under heavy noise levels, we achieve a
detection rate 56.5% for 15-second query duration. All experiments are
conducted on public large-scale dataset of over 100K songs, with queries
matched against a database of 56 million vectors.

*Changfeng Gao,Zhihao Du,Shiliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DiffRO enhances TTS systems by optimizing rewards directly from neural codec tokens, using Gumbel-Softmax for differentiability and a multi-task reward model for diverse feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve TTS performance by bypassing synthesized audio reliance in RLHF and enabling differentiable reward optimization.

Method: DiffRO computes rewards from neural codec tokens, uses Gumbel-Softmax for differentiability, and integrates a multi-task reward model.

Result: Achieves SOTA WER on seed-tts-eval, improves pronunciation, and enables zero-shot control of emotional/quality attributes.

Conclusion: DiffRO is a promising approach for TTS enhancement, offering efficiency and flexibility in reward optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO)
method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly
compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on
synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to
render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF
training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model
which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can
augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental
results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy
of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the
seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we
demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a
zero-shot manner.

TL;DR: An enhanced MOS prediction system using self-supervised learning and MoE architecture is proposed, but sentence-level performance improvements remain limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance variations in speech quality assessment across different granularity levels.

Method: Utilizes self-supervised models (e.g., wav2vec2) with a MoE classification head and synthetic data augmentation.

Result: Limited improvements in sentence-level prediction despite MoE and expanded dataset.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations in sentence-level assessment and explores causes of performance differences.

Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment plays a crucial role in the development
of speech synthesis systems, but existing models exhibit significant
performance variations across different granularity levels of prediction tasks.
This paper proposes an enhanced MOS prediction system based on self-supervised
learning speech models, incorporating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification
head and utilizing synthetic data from multiple commercial generation models
for data augmentation. Our method builds upon existing self-supervised models
such as wav2vec2, designing a specialized MoE architecture to address different
types of speech quality assessment tasks. We also collected a large-scale
synthetic speech dataset encompassing the latest text-to-speech, speech
conversion, and speech enhancement systems. However, despite the adoption of
the MoE architecture and expanded dataset, the model's performance improvements
in sentence-level prediction tasks remain limited. Our work reveals the
limitations of current methods in handling sentence-level quality assessment,
provides new technical pathways for the field of automatic speech quality
assessment, and also delves into the fundamental causes of performance
differences across different assessment granularities.

*Young Hun Kim,Seungyeon Kim,Yonghyeon Lee,Frank Chongwoo Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamGrasp leverages generative models for partial-view 3D recognition, enabling robust reconstruction in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in cluttered, occluded settings due to reliance on symmetry or curated datasets.

Method: Combines coarse 3D reconstruction, contrastive learning for segmentation, and text-guided refinement.

Result: Accurate geometry recovery and high success in tasks like decluttering and retrieval.

Conclusion: DreamGrasp overcomes prior limitations, proving effective in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

*Haitao Lu,Haijier Chen,Haoze Liu,Shoujian Zhang,Bo Xu,Ziao Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel 3DGS-LSR framework for precise robot localization in urban environments using monocular RGB images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unreliable GNSS positioning and inefficiencies in traditional mapping for autonomous robots in complex urban settings.

Method: Combines multi-sensor data for high-accuracy 3DGS maps and uses SuperPoint/SuperGlue for feature matching with iterative optimization for real-time localization.

Result: Achieves centimeter-level accuracy (0.026m-0.081m) on KITTI dataset, surpassing other methods with monocular input.

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR enables reliable robot localization in GNSS-challenged urban environments using minimal hardware.

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel module-wise Federated Learning (FL) framework for Grasp Pose Detection (GPD) reduces communication overhead by focusing on slower-converging modules, outperforming FedAvg in accuracy and real-world grasp success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the data privacy and centralization challenges in GPD by leveraging FL, while mitigating its high communication costs for resource-constrained robots.

Method: A two-phase FL framework: full-model training followed by communication-efficient training of slower-converging modules, validated on GraspNet-1B and real-world robot experiments.

Result: Higher accuracy than FedAvg for the same communication budget and superior grasp success in cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: The framework improves the trade-off between communication cost and model performance, enabling decentralized training of robust GPD models.

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time algorithm to estimate and mitigate speech workload in demanding task environments, improving performance by adapting system demands dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demanding tasks require quick and accurate performance, but fluctuating workload levels can hinder this. Adapting system demands based on real-time workload estimation can enhance performance.

Method: The paper introduces an algorithm for real-time estimation of speech workload, addressing gaps in existing systems that lack real-time functionality or speech workload focus.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates accuracy and generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.

Conclusion: Real-time speech workload estimation is vital for adaptive human-machine systems, offering a pathway to mitigate undesirable workload states.

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving systems struggle with complex scenarios and edge cases due to poor semantic interpretation and intention discernment.

Method: LeAD integrates a high-frequency E2E subsystem for real-time tasks and a low-frequency LLM module for enhanced scenario comprehension and decision-making via CoT reasoning.

Result: In CARLA Simulator, LeAD scored 71 points on Leaderboard V1 with 93% route completion, excelling in unconventional scenarios.

Conclusion: LeAD demonstrates superior performance in handling complex urban driving scenarios by leveraging dual-rate architecture and LLM augmentation.

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional
scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route
completion of 93%.

Motivation: Address challenges in autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments like forests and mountainous regions due to irregular terrain and complex road conditions.

Method: Tested A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and NIACO on 2D road-maps (DeepGlobe dataset) and 3D road-maps (Hamilton LiDAR dataset). Evaluated path cost, computation time, and memory consumption.

Result: Dijkstra consistently performed best in both 2D and 3D scenarios, offering stable and efficient navigation on dense, pixel-level geospatial road-maps.

Conclusion: Dijkstra is reliable for static terrain navigation, providing a foundation for future research on dynamic path planning in complex environments.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores data diversity in robotic manipulation, challenging the 'more diverse is better' notion, and identifies task diversity as key, while proposing a debiasing method for performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the principles of effective data scaling in robotic manipulation, contrasting with NLP and CV, and to challenge conventional wisdom on data diversity.

Method: Investigates data diversity across task, embodiment, and expert dimensions through experiments on various robot platforms, proposing a distribution debiasing method for velocity ambiguity.

Result: Task diversity is more critical than demonstration quantity; multi-embodiment pre-training is optional; expert diversity can hinder learning. The debiasing method improves performance by 15%.

Conclusion: Provides insights and practical guidance for scaling robotic manipulation datasets, emphasizing task diversity and addressing expert diversity challenges.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

TL;DR: A fast, adaptive algorithm estimates collision probabilities for dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, achieving 3.5% median error and 0.21ms runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work often neglects temporal dependence in collision probability, leading to overestimation. This paper addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes an adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme for trajectory uncertainty, tested on autonomous vehicle logs.

Result: Median error of 3.5% and runtime of 0.21ms, validated on 400 real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively accounts for temporal dependence, improving accuracy and speed in collision probability estimation.

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities
between dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, where the trajectories are
given as a sequence of poses with Gaussian distributions. We propose an
adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple
algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error
of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold
6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the
collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior
work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability.
Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world
scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs,
where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible for low-cost, force-sensorless manipulators using 4-channel bilateral control, improving imitation learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing teleoperation systems for low-cost manipulators lack force feedback, limiting their effectiveness in fast or contact-rich tasks.

Method: The proposed method uses 4-channel bilateral control, incorporating nonlinear compensation, velocity/force estimation, and variable gain for inertial variation.

Result: The system enables high-fidelity teleoperation and improves imitation learning by integrating force feedback into policy inputs and outputs.

Conclusion: The approach is practical for affordable hardware, enhancing teleoperation and data collection for imitation learning.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

TL;DR: EC-Flow is a framework for robotic manipulation that learns from action-unlabeled videos by predicting embodiment-centric flow, improving generalization to diverse scenarios like deformable objects and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on labeled datasets or object-centric flow, limiting their applicability to rigid objects and simple scenarios. EC-Flow aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: EC-Flow predicts embodiment-centric flow, incorporates kinematic constraints, and uses a goal-alignment module for language instruction integration.

Result: EC-Flow outperforms prior methods with 62% improvement in occluded object handling, 45% in deformable object manipulation, and 80% in non-object-displacement tasks.

Conclusion: EC-Flow offers a practical, generalizable solution for robotic manipulation, validated in simulation and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: HRRRCast, a machine learning-based emulator of the HRRR model, introduces two architectures (ResHRRR and GraphHRRR) for efficient weather forecasting, outperforming HRRR in some metrics while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a computationally efficient alternative to the HRRR model for operational weather forecasting using advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: HRRRCast includes ResNet-based (ResHRRR) and Graph Neural Network-based (GraphHRRR) models, with ResHRRR using convolutional networks and probabilistic forecasting via DDIM. It trains a single model for multiple lead times and uses a greedy rollout strategy.

Result: ResHRRR outperforms HRRR at light rainfall thresholds and matches performance at moderate thresholds. It improves storm placement, reduces frequency bias, and maintains sharper spatial detail. GraphHRRR underperforms but shows potential.

Conclusion: HRRRCast advances data-driven weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble capability, though GraphHRRR needs further development.

Abstract: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a convection-allowing model
used in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States
(CONUS). To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce
HRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning
techniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)
and a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional
neural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise
Linear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a
single model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy
rollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity
over the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR
outperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves
competitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the
StormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,
b) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on
analysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in
StormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling
downscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and
object-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and
higher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain
sharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.
While GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for
future graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient,
data-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble
capability.

Method: Uses a transfer-learning approach, parameterizing binding energy as the difference between complex folding energy and individual folding energies, leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning with folding and binding energy data.

Result: StaB-ddG matches FoldX's accuracy while being 1000x faster, demonstrating strong zero-shot performance and fine-tuning capabilities.

Conclusion: StaB-ddG is a breakthrough in efficient and accurate prediction of protein-protein binding energy changes, bridging the gap between deep learning and empirical methods.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of mutational effects on protein-protein binding energies
is an open problem with applications in structural biology and therapeutic
design. Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,
presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform
computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In
response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in
protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The
key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the
folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of
its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as
a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be
fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited
binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first
deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical
force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.

### [292] [BMFM-DNA: A SNP-aware DNA foundation model to capture variant effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05265)
*Hongyang Li,Sanjoy Dey,Bum Chul Kwon,Michael Danziger,Michal Rosen-Tzvi,Jianying Hu,James Kozloski,Ching-Huei Tsou,Bharath Dandala,Pablo Meyer*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM) to improve DNA language models by integrating sequence variations like SNPs, enhancing biological function capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DNA language models (DNALMs) lack the ability to encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations, such as SNPs, which are crucial for genomic functions.

Method: Two models, BMFM-DNA-REF and BMFM-DNA-SNP, are pre-trained using ModernBERT. BMFM-DNA-REF uses reference genome sequences, while BMFM-DNA-SNP employs a novel representation scheme for sequence variations.

Result: Integrating sequence variations improves performance on fine-tuning tasks. The models show promise for SNP imputation in promoter detection but face limited benchmark evaluation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of incorporating sequence variations in DNALMs and releases models and code for community use and further evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results
on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to
decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as "words"
that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from
natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar.
Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved
high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do
not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To
address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate
sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as
they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT
to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely,
BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths
along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and
BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel
representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate
that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological
functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the
model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP
imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we
acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully
evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future
and encourage community contributions, we release our models through
HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), a BCI algorithm that improves cross-subject adaptability by extracting common features from EEG data, achieving a 3.28% performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BCI models struggle with inter-individual variability, limiting their generalizability. This work aims to enhance cross-subject adaptability.

Method: CSDD involves training personalized models, transforming them into relation spectrums, identifying common features statistically, and building a universal model.

Result: Experiments on the BCIC IV 2a dataset show a 3.28% improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: CSDD successfully extracts common features for a universal BCI model, advancing broader BCI applications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct
control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG)
generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to
inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit
poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and
widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a
universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific
methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2)
transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common
features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject
universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV
2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for
training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding
performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results
demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves
a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a
novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal
cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI
technology.

### [294] [Hierarchy or Heterarchy? A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05888)
*Jeff Hawkins,Niels Leadholm,Viviane Clay*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper challenges the traditional hierarchical model of neocortical organization, proposing a 'heterarchy' and the 'Thousand Brains Theory,' where cortical columns function as independent sensorimotor learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in the hierarchical model of neocortical processing and propose a more flexible framework.

Method: Introduces the 'Thousand Brains Theory,' analyzing long-range connections between cortical regions and the thalamus to explain sensorimotor learning.

Result: Suggests cortical columns can learn and recognize 3D objects independently, with hierarchical connections used for compositional learning.

Conclusion: The heterarchical model and Thousand Brains Theory offer a novel perspective with implications for neuroscience and AI.

Abstract: In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows
up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex
features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of
connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many
anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical
interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond
in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other
evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at
the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more
suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new
interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the
neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains
Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning
system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a
sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,
can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the
hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional
structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the
theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between
cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these
connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a
heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an
essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel
perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and
artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: SQLBarber is an LLM-based system for generating customized and realistic SQL workloads, eliminating manual template crafting and improving efficiency and alignment with target cost distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of acquiring real-world SQL queries due to privacy concerns and limitations of existing generation methods in customization and realism.

Method: SQLBarber uses a declarative interface, an LLM-powered pipeline with self-correction, and a Bayesian Optimizer to generate SQL queries matching user-defined cost distributions.

Result: SQLBarber reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude and improves alignment with target cost distributions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SQLBarber is a scalable and efficient solution for generating realistic SQL workloads, outperforming existing methods in customization and performance.

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces prompt migration to stabilize GenAI applications amid changing LLMs, using a case study to show how it restores reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid evolution of LLMs causes inconsistent application behavior, undermining business reliability.

Method: Proposes prompt migration framework, including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, tested on Tursio enterprise search.

Result: Structured prompt migration fully recovers lost application reliability due to model drift.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing for dependable GenAI applications.

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural
language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large
language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently
is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application
behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for
mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt
migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid
changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study,
we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration
framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate
how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that
structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that
was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned,
emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to
ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a fast sampling diffusion model (PWD) for limited-angle CT reconstruction, combining prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion to improve efficiency and preserve details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models for medical imaging are computationally intensive, and skip-sampling methods lose fine details.

Method: PWD maps LACT images to fully sampled targets during training, uses LACT images as prior during inference, and fuses multi-scale wavelet features.

Result: PWD achieves 1.7 dB PSNR and 10% SSIM improvement with only 50 sampling steps.

Conclusion: PWD efficiently enhances LACT reconstruction quality while reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical
imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard
diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation is crucial for wound management and automated assessment, but challenges like class imbalance and variability persist.

Method: The study integrates channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms, uses EfficientNet-B7 as the encoder backbone, and employs data augmentation, Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, and model ensembling with Test Time Augmentation.

Result: The proposed method achieved an F1-score of 0.8640 on a benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The dual-attention U-Net++ architecture is effective for complex medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa
significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and
automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++
archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms
toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images
effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and
encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal
encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific
models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian
hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test
Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was
evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition.
Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds,
25% scalemarkers), calculated externally by competition organizers on
undisclosed hard-ware. The proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8640,
underscoring itseffectiveness for complex medical segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: HA2HA is a self-supervised denoising framework for ultrasound microvascular imaging, improving SNR and CNR by over 15 dB without requiring labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low SNR in UMI hinders vascular quantification and disease diagnosis, especially in contrast-free or deep tissue scenarios.

Method: HA2HA constructs training pairs from complementary angular subsets of RF blood flow data, leveraging noise variation while preserving vascular signals.

Result: Validation on diverse datasets showed over 15 dB improvement in CNR and SNR, enhancing microvascular flow visualization in CDI.

Conclusion: HA2HA provides a label-free, generalizable, and clinically viable solution for robust vascular imaging in UMI.

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-Super, a report-supervision loss that uses radiology reports to enhance tumor segmentation in CT scans, significantly improving AI performance even with limited segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tumor segmentation masks are scarce due to the time and expertise required to create them, while radiology reports are abundant. Leveraging reports can scale segmentation efforts.

Method: Proposed R-Super, a method converting radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation. Used a dataset of 6,718 CT-Report pairs and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets.

Result: R-Super improved tumor segmentation, increasing F1 Score by up to 16% compared to mask-only training, even with very few masks (e.g., 50).

Conclusion: R-Super effectively leverages radiology reports to enhance tumor segmentation, demonstrating strong performance improvements in various scenarios.

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis,
yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and
expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand
tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with
radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for
scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that
converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation
AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital),
and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our
R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor
segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to
16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available
radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly
improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g.,
50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion-based framework for Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) that addresses missing angular projections and noise, outperforming baselines in robustness and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LACT suffers from incomplete sinograms and artifacts due to missing angular projections, and existing methods ignore measurement noise.

Method: The approach treats LACT as a sinogram inpainting task using a Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) and introduces RNSD$^+$, a noise-aware rectification mechanism.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in data consistency and perceptual quality, generalizing well across noise levels and scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses LACT challenges, offering robust and reliable reconstruction under noise.

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem
where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe
artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have
demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements
and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this
limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a
diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a
Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To
improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel
noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time
uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data
consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise
intensity and acquisition scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack granular annotations for specific organ diseases, limiting detailed studies. ADPv2 addresses this gap for gastrointestinal histopathology.

Method: The dataset includes hierarchical annotations of 32 histological tissue types. A multilabel representation learning model (VMamba) is trained in two stages.

Result: The model achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification and reveals patterns in colon cancer development pathways.

Conclusion: ADPv2 facilitates organ-specific research and biomarker discovery, demonstrating its utility in computational pathology.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation
learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.
We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision
(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that
our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential
biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues
affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that
confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset

Motivation: To address the resource-intensive nature of creating foundation models for computational pathology by introducing a more efficient supervised approach.

Method: Supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels, requiring fewer resources than self-supervised training.

Result: TCv2 outperforms SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is trained on freely available data. It also offers explainability through a shared attention module.

Conclusion: TCv2 provides a resource-efficient and high-performing alternative to self-supervised foundation models in computational pathology, with added explainability.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology
by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically
relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a
resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the
extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide
images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for
whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end
multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the
training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model
shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping
benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared
trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across
different tasks.

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework automates co-registration of IVUS and OCT images, showing high accuracy and speed comparable to expert analysts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fully automated, efficient co-registration of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for large-scale research.

Method: Used expert-annotated data to train DL models for feature extraction, applied dynamic time warping and dynamic programming for longitudinal and circumferential co-registration.

Result: High concordance with experts (CCC >0.99 longitudinal, >0.90 circumferential), processing time <90s per vessel.

Conclusion: The DL framework is fast, accurate, and suitable for large-scale multimodality imaging studies.

Abstract: Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully
automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and
results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that
underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their
non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders
annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the
side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and
10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction
of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and
OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to
co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the
circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic
programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed
high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and
circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance
correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the
circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal
and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable
performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process
imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based
framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is
fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.

### [305] [Enhancing Synthetic CT from CBCT via Multimodal Fusion and End-To-End Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06067)
*Maximilian Tschuchnig,Lukas Lamminger,Philipp Steininger,Michael Gadermayr*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced method for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from CBCT by integrating a learnable registration module to address misalignment between CBCT and preoperative CT, improving sCT quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT images suffer from artifacts and lower quality compared to CT. Synthetic CT generation can bridge this gap, but misalignment between CBCT and preoperative CT data poses a challenge.

Method: The authors introduce an end-to-end learnable registration module within the sCT pipeline to align CBCT and preoperative CT data, evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: The method improves sCT quality, outperforming baselines in 79 out of 90 settings, especially for low-quality CBCT and moderately misaligned CT.

Conclusion: Integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation enhances quality, demonstrating robustness and generalizability in clinical settings.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

### [306] [LangMamba: A Language-driven Mamba Framework for Low-dose CT Denoising with Vision-language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06140)
*Zhihao Chen,Tao Chen,Chenhui Wang,Qi Gao,Huidong Xie,Chuang Niu,Ge Wang,Hongming Shan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LangMamba is a language-driven framework for LDCT denoising that uses vision-language models to enhance semantic guidance, outperforming existing methods in detail preservation and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT (LDCT) reduces radiation but degrades image quality. Existing deep learning methods lack high-level semantic guidance, which vision-language models (VLMs) can provide.

Method: LangMamba uses a two-stage approach: 1) Pre-train a Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) to map NDCT images into a semantic space. 2) Combine LangAE with SEED (Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser) and LangDA (Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment) Loss for denoising.

Result: LangMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving detail preservation and visual fidelity. LangAE generalizes well to unseen datasets, reducing training costs. LangDA loss enhances explainability.

Conclusion: Language can serve as a powerful supervisory signal for LDCT denoising, offering improved performance and generalizability. The framework is publicly available.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on

*Tristan Kirscher,Sylvain Faisan,Xavier Coubez,Loris Barrier,Philippe Meyer*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSAT, a study on pediatric medical imaging segmentation, comparing strategies using the nnU-Net framework to address challenges like anatomical differences and institutional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric medical imaging differs significantly from adults, making adult-trained models suboptimal for segmenting pediatric structures.

Method: PSAT evaluates four axes: fingerprint dataset, learning set, data augmentation, and transfer learning (finetuning vs. continual learning), benchmarking on pediatric CT datasets.

Result: Adult-based training plans misalign with pediatric anatomy, degrading performance, while continual learning improves generalization across pediatric datasets.

Conclusion: PSAT provides actionable insights for pediatric segmentation, emphasizing the need for pediatric-specific approaches and the benefits of continual learning.

Abstract: Pediatric medical imaging presents unique challenges due to significant
anatomical and developmental differences compared to adults. Direct application
of segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal
performance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures. To address
these challenges, several strategies leveraging the nnU-Net framework have been
proposed, differing along four key axes: (i) the fingerprint dataset (adult,
pediatric, or a combination thereof) from which the Training Plan -including
the network architecture-is derived; (ii) the Learning Set (adult, pediatric,
or mixed), (iii) Data Augmentation parameters, and (iv) the Transfer learning
method (finetuning versus continual learning). In this work, we introduce PSAT
(Pediatric Segmentation Approaches via Adult Augmentations and Transfer
learning), a systematic study that investigates the impact of these axes on
segmentation performance. We benchmark the derived strategies on two pediatric
CT datasets and compare them with state-of-theart methods, including a
commercial radiotherapy solution. PSAT highlights key pitfalls and provides
actionable insights for improving pediatric segmentation. Our experiments
reveal that a training plan based on an adult fingerprint dataset is misaligned
with pediatric anatomy-resulting in significant performance degradation,
especially when segmenting fine structures-and that continual learning
strategies mitigate institutional shifts, thus enhancing generalization across
diverse pediatric datasets. The code is available at

### [308] [Just Say Better or Worse: A Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Medical Image Segmentation Without Manual Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05815)
*Yizhe Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A Human-AI framework reduces manual annotation in medical image segmentation by using binary preference feedback instead of pixel-level labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation is labor-intensive, hindering AI system development in medical imaging.

Method: Uses a preference learning paradigm with four components: adaptable foundation model, label propagation, clicking agent, and multi-round segmentation learning.

Result: Achieves competitive segmentation performance on three datasets without direct manual annotation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces annotation burden while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Manual annotation of medical images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming
process, posing a significant bottleneck in the development and deployment of
robust medical imaging AI systems. This paper introduces a novel Human-AI
collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially
reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual
pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning
paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply
indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a
previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable
foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on
feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse
feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round
segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation
network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label
propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary
preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate
the images.

### [309] [Beating the Best Constant Rebalancing Portfolio in Long-Term Investment: A Generalization of the Kelly Criterion and Universal Learning Algorithm for Markets with Serial Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05994)
*Duy Khanh Lam*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm for online portfolio optimization that leverages serial dependence in asset returns, outperforming the best constant rebalancing portfolio without requiring large datasets or distribution assumptions. It also generalizes the Kelly criterion for serial dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning algorithms perform poorly in cumulative wealth compared to the best constant rebalancing portfolio, and feature selection in high-dimensional settings is challenging. Serial dependence in asset returns offers an untapped opportunity.

Method: The algorithm learns serial dependence patterns (e.g., day-of-the-week effects) from gradually revealed data, without distribution assumptions. It generalizes the Kelly criterion to handle serial dependence in a stochastic market modeled as an i.i.d. process of random matrices.

Result: The algorithm outperforms the best constant rebalancing portfolio and matches the growth rate of the optimal strategy under the generalized Kelly criterion, even in non-stationary markets. Experiments confirm its effectiveness when serial dependence is significant.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is broadly applicable, robust to market conditions, and leverages serial dependence to achieve superior performance without relying on large datasets or restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms
generate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared
to the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being
consistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be
improved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in
feature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial
dependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar
effects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are
commonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an
algorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,
without any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that
eventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing
portfolio.
  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'
returns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as
an independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such
a stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary
processes fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a
strategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,
matching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly
criterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the
theoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as
long as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the
generalized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms
the broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts.

### [310] [The Neural Networks with Tensor Weights and the Corresponding Fermionic Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303)
*Guojun Huang,Kai Zhou*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper connects complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) to fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), showing CVNNs with tensor-valued weights generate fermionic fields. It extends neural network QFT beyond bosonic theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in neural network quantum field theory (NN-QFT) by linking CVNNs to fermionic QFT, which was previously limited to bosonic fields.

Method: Promoting hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors to induce anticommutation relations. Analytical study of the generating functional reveals the quantum state in the infinite-width limit.

Result: CVNNs intrinsically generate fermionic fields, with parameters mapping to eigenvalues and dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free fermion correlators.

Conclusion: The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to fermionic QFT, extending NN-QFT and enabling fermionic symmetry encoding in machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued
neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a
fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field
theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures
to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued
weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting
hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce
anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through
analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum
state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the
input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the
quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output
layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free
fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation.
The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to
fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional.
It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding
fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications
in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.

*Lennart Busch,Daniel Tebernum,Gissel Velarde*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLMs can automate metadata maintenance for text-based data, generating high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata comparable to human efforts, with larger models and fine-tuning improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual metadata creation is time-consuming and requires expertise; the study explores if LLMs can automate this process efficiently.

Method: Tested zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies with various LLMs, including a fine-tuned model for classification, to generate metadata like titles and keywords.

Result: LLMs produced metadata comparable to human-created content, with larger models and fine-tuning enhancing performance. Few-shot prompting generally outperformed zero-shot.

Conclusion: LLMs provide a faster, reliable method for metadata creation, but success depends on task-specific criteria and domain context.

Abstract: Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important
for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business
models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable
data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data.
Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to
answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a
manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study
investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data
and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and
few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating
metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for
classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to
human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic
understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning
significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields
better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to
create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of
task-specific criteria and domain context.

TL;DR: Proactive defense framework for LLM-generated misinformation, improving prevention by 63% over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the societal risks of highly plausible, self-reinforcing misinformation from LLMs, which traditional detection fails to mitigate.

Method: Proposes a Three Pillars framework: Knowledge Credibility, Inference Reliability, and Input Robustness.

Result: Proactive strategies show 63% improvement in misinformation prevention, though with computational overhead.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on robust knowledge foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces for LLMs.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A multi-task LSTM model enhances personalized learning path recommendations by leveraging shared information across tasks, outperforming baselines on the ASSIST09 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized learning requires adaptive content and pacing, with learning path recommendation being key. Deep reinforcement learning advances make such modeling practical.

Method: The approach reframes learning path recommendation as a Seq2Seq problem, using a shared LSTM layer for common features and task-specific layers for objectives. A non-repeat loss avoids redundant recommendations.

Result: The model significantly outperforms baseline methods on the ASSIST09 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-task LSTM model effectively improves learning path recommendation by combining shared and task-specific features, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Personalized learning is a student-centered educational approach that adapts
content, pace, and assessment to meet each learner's unique needs. As the key
technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation
sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and
exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning,
have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This
paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path
recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach
reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's
historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common
features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing,
along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant
recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the
recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the
proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path
recommendation.

TL;DR: Analysis of AI search systems' citation patterns reveals a concentration on few news outlets with liberal bias, but user satisfaction is unaffected by source quality or political leaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the citation behavior of AI-powered search systems and their impact on news dissemination.

Method: Analyzed data from the AI Search Arena, including 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google models, focusing on 366,000 citations.

Result: 9% of citations reference news, with a concentration on few outlets and liberal bias. User satisfaction is not influenced by source quality or political leaning.

Conclusion: AI search systems exhibit biased citation patterns, but user preferences remain unaffected, posing challenges for design and governance.

Abstract: AI-powered search systems are emerging as new information gatekeepers,
fundamentally transforming how users access news and information. Despite their
growing influence, the citation patterns of these systems remain poorly
understood. We address this gap by analyzing data from the AI Search Arena, a
head-to-head evaluation platform for AI search systems. The dataset comprises
over 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from models across three major
providers: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Among the over 366,000 citations
embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and
governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve attributed community search (ACS) by leveraging prompt-tuning from NLP to refine graph queries and strengthen node connections.

Method: PLACE inserts structural and learnable prompt tokens into graphs, forming a prompt-augmented graph, and uses an alternating training paradigm for optimization. A divide-and-conquer strategy enhances scalability.

Result: PLACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 22% in F1 scores on 9 real-world graphs for three ACS query types.

Conclusion: PLACE effectively bridges graph nodes for query-specific community search, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PLACE (Prompt Learning for Attributed Community
Search), an innovative graph prompt learning framework for ACS. Enlightened by
prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt
tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural
and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement
mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph
structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens
connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more
effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute
similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training
paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover,
we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the
model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world
graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries,
where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts
on average.

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across

of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,
providing insights for targeted training data augmentation.

### [320] [When Transformers Meet Recommenders: Integrating Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation with Fine-Tuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05733)
*Kechen Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SASRecLLM integrates SASRec and LLMs for improved recommendations by combining collaborative filtering with LLM semantic power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals for high-quality recommendations, prompting the need for a hybrid approach.

Method: SASRecLLM combines SASRec (collaborative encoder) with a fine-tuned LLM using LoRA, connected via a mapping layer and optimized with three training strategies.

Result: SASRecLLM outperforms baselines in cold-start and warm-start scenarios, demonstrating robust improvements.

Conclusion: The framework advances LLM-based recommendations by effectively fusing collaborative filtering with fine-tuned LLMs, offering a modular solution.

Abstract: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures
long-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical
interactions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their
powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs
often lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential
for high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To
address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that
integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to
align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are
designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements
over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work
advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and
effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the
semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:

### [321] [Self-Attention Based Multi-Scale Graph Auto-Encoder Network of 3D Meshes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05304)
*Saqib Nazir,Olivier Lézoray,Sébastien Bougleux*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 3DGeoMeshNet is a GCN-based framework using anisotropic convolutions to learn global and local features directly from 3D meshes, outperforming previous methods in reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending CNNs to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to their non-Euclidean nature, and existing GCN methods often fail to capture both local and global features effectively.

Method: The proposed 3DGeoMeshNet uses anisotropic convolution layers and a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure to process meshes directly in the spatial domain, preserving the original polygonal format.

Result: Experiments on the COMA dataset show superior reconstruction accuracy compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet effectively captures both local and global features of 3D meshes, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction without intermediate representations.

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LighthouseGS is a 3DGS-based framework for real-time novel view synthesis using handheld cameras, addressing challenges in pose estimation and 3D point accuracy with geometric priors and planar structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity rendering with simple panorama-style motion from handheld devices, overcoming limitations of traditional methods requiring meticulous image capture.

Method: Leverages rough geometric priors (camera poses, monocular depth) and planar structures, using plane scaffold assembly for 3D point initialization and pruning for stability. Includes geometric and photometric corrections.

Result: Achieves photorealistic rendering in indoor scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Conclusion: LighthouseGS demonstrates practical, high-quality novel view synthesis with handheld cameras, expanding accessibility for general users.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

### [323] [Challenges & Opportunities with LLM-Assisted Visualization Retargeting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01436)
*Luke S. Snyder,Chenglong Wang,Steven M. Drucker*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to simplify retargeting custom visualizations to new datasets, comparing direct code generation with a structured synthesis approach, identifying challenges in data transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retargeting existing visualizations to new datasets is complex and time-consuming, requiring deep familiarity with the code and data. LLMs offer potential to automate this process.

Method: Two approaches are evaluated: (1) direct LLM code generation and (2) a structured synthesis pipeline where LLMs guide code construction. Performance is assessed across datasets and chart complexities.

Result: Both approaches face difficulties with untransformed data. The study categorizes failure types and severity, highlighting limitations in current methods.

Conclusion: Design recommendations are provided for future retargeting systems to improve LLM-assisted adaptation, addressing data transformation challenges.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web,
retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains
difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author
familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new
dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be
achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization
retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its
potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM
assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,
categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we
compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully
generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more
constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code
construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual
encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both
approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and
discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.

*Aiur Nanzatov,Lourdes Peña-Castillo,Oscar Meruvia-Pastor*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: NRXR-ID enables 2FA in VR using smartphones, tested with four challenge types, finding checkers-style and PIN entry most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2FA is challenging in VR due to HMDs blocking real-world visibility; NRXR-ID addresses this by integrating smartphones.

Method: Proposed NRXR-ID with four challenge types (including checkers-style) and three configurations, tested in a 4x3 within-subjects study with 30 participants.

Result: Checkers-style challenge was most effective, followed by PIN entry via smartphone in VR.

Conclusion: NRXR-ID successfully implements 2FA in VR, with checkers-style and PIN challenges being the preferred methods.

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and
secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is
difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world
surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor
authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The
proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using
their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where
we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel
checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three
different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to
support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3
within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We
collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to
collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the
checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option,
followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and
answered within the VR environment.

TL;DR: Constella, an LLM-based tool, aids writers in creating interconnected characters by suggesting related characters, revealing inner thoughts, and manifesting relationships, improving character dynamics in storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writers struggle with envisioning new characters, balancing traits, and fleshing out relationships, highlighting a need for supportive tools.

Method: Constella uses multi-agent LLM features (FRIENDS DISCOVERY, JOURNALS, COMMENTS) to assist writers in character creation and relationship development.

Result: The tool enabled expansive character communities, facilitated comparisons of thoughts/emotions, and deepened understanding of relationships.

Conclusion: Multi-agent interactions can distribute writers' attention and effort across character casts, enhancing storytelling.

Abstract: Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a
critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study
(N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could
influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among
characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these
observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that
supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella
suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner
mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and
manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature).
Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella
enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters,
facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened
writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing
how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort
across the character cast.

*Kyriakos Georgiou,Constantinos Siettos,Athanasios N. Yannacopoulos*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper extends Fredholm Neural Networks (FNNs) to solve forward and inverse problems for elliptic PDEs, introducing Potential Fredholm Neural Networks (PFNNs) for accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of solving linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs using neural networks while ensuring accuracy and explainability.

Method: A deep neural network (DNN) is designed to mimic fixed-point iterations for solving elliptic PDEs via boundary integral methods, with architecture derived from the iterative scheme.

Result: PFNN achieves high accuracy, with small errors in the domain interior and near machine-precision on the boundary, supported by explicit error bounds.

Conclusion: The PFNN framework provides an explainable and accurate solution for elliptic PDEs, respecting boundary conditions and offering performance guarantees.

Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm
NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle
forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial
differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network
(DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point
iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method
within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases
and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the
iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm
Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and
explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near
machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the
consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the
interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These
error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the
integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components
of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme
that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of
the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem
for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A feedforward neural network replaces the classical WENO weighting procedure for hyperbolic conservation laws, achieving high accuracy and outperforming WENO3-Z.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of WENO schemes in solving hyperbolic conservation laws by leveraging neural networks.

Method: A supervised learning approach trains a neural network to replace WENO weighting, using a new dataset for conservative approximation and a symmetric-balancing loss function.

Result: The resulting WENO3-CADNNs outperform WENO3-Z and match WENO5-JS accuracy in benchmark tests.

Conclusion: Neural networks can effectively enhance WENO schemes, offering robust generalization and superior performance.

Abstract: In this work, we present the feedforward neural network based on the
conservative approximation to the derivative from point values, for the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in solving hyperbolic
conservation laws. The feedforward neural network, whose inputs are point
values from the three-point stencil and outputs are two nonlinear weights,
takes the place of the classical WENO weighting procedure. For the training
phase, we employ the supervised learning and create a new labeled dataset for
one-dimensional conservative approximation, where we construct a numerical flux
function from the given point values such that the flux difference approximates
the derivative to high-order accuracy. The symmetric-balancing term is
introduced for the loss function so that it propels the neural network to match
the conservative approximation to the derivative and satisfy the symmetric
property that WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z have in common. The consequent WENO schemes,
WENO3-CADNNs, demonstrate robust generalization across various benchmark
scenarios and resolutions, where they outperform WENO3-Z and achieve accuracy
comparable to WENO5-JS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clock meshes in VLSI systems are hard to analyze due to reconvergent paths and multi-source driving, with existing methods being either slow (SPICE) or inaccurate (simplified models).

Method: Proposes GATMesh, a GNN-based framework that models clock meshes as graphs with structural and physical features, trained on SPICE data.

Result: Achieves 5.27ps average delay error and 47146x speed-up over multi-threaded SPICE.

Conclusion: GATMesh offers a fast and accurate alternative for clock mesh analysis.

Abstract: Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing
skew and handling PVT variations, but analyzing them is difficult due to
reconvergent paths, multi-source driving, and input mesh buffer skew. SPICE

framework that models the clock mesh as a graph with augmented structural and
physical features. Trained on SPICE data, GATMesh achieves high accuracy with
average delay error of 5.27ps on unseen benchmarks, while achieving speed-ups

Motivation: The exponential growth of the design space for prefix adders with increasing bit-width presents optimization challenges, which existing methods struggle to address in terms of performance, generalization, and scalability.

Method: PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks (backbone synthesis and structure refinement) and leverages an LLM fine-tuned with high-quality data and reasoning traces from E-graph.

Result: PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently smaller areas than baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and generalization in commercial EDA flows.

Conclusion: PrefixAgent offers an effective and scalable solution for prefix adder optimization, demonstrating the potential of LLM-powered frameworks in hardware design.

Abstract: Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space
grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges.
Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder
optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks
including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively
reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables
us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with
E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental
results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently
smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and

Result: Identified key challenges (e.g., algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation) and consolidated progress while highlighting open questions in modeling dynamics and advancing algorithms.

Conclusion: The review enhances understanding of critical node research, emphasizing the need for scalable, interpretable metrics and integration of machine learning in complex systems.

Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse
phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and

contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical
foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity

control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review
bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods
based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by
highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different

identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time
evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends the analysis of logistic bandits to the multinomial setting, improving regret bounds by leveraging problem non-linearity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complex applications with multiple choices (e.g., reinforcement learning, recommender systems) by generalizing binary logistic bandit results.

Method: Extends the definition of κ* to multinomial settings and proposes an efficient algorithm exploiting non-linearity.

Result: Achieves a regret bound of O~(Kd√(T/κ*)), improving over existing O~(Kd√T) bounds, with a matching lower bound.

Conclusion: The proposed method is optimal in its dependence on κ* and suitable for multinomial logistic bandit problems.

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized
linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting
actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from
multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on
understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et
al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant
$\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and
which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates
the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from
$\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial
logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with
more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems.
To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial
setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's
non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $
\smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the
number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing
guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $.
Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound,
showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts in financial data without relying on rigid parametric assumptions.

Method: Integrates quantile regression with a conformal calibration layer, adapting online via a decaying learning rate.

Result: TCP provides sharper intervals with competitive or superior coverage, especially in high-volatility regimes.

Conclusion: TCP is a robust, adaptive, and interpretable tool for financial uncertainty quantification, bridging statistical and machine learning approaches.

Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a novel framework for
constructing prediction intervals in financial time-series with guaranteed
finite-sample validity. TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal
calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid
design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to
accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which
are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric
assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH,
Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P
500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show
that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior
coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's
strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in
modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and
interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing
the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.

TL;DR: The paper presents an exact, closed-form expression for the score function in nonlinear diffusion generative models, using stochastic analysis tools and eliminating Malliavin derivatives for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance score estimation methods in generative modeling by deriving an exact, closed-form score function for nonlinear diffusion models.

Method: Combines Malliavin derivatives, Skorokhod integrals, and a new Bismut-type formula to derive the score function in terms of first and second variation processes.

Result: An exact, closed-form score function expression, enhancing practical applicability and enabling new sampling algorithms.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for improving score-based diffusion models and extends to broader SDE classes, opening new research directions.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful
tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the
score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to
the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a
variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score
matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we
derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad
class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern
stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint
operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type
formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written
entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all
Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its
practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work
offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in
generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for
complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader
classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the
development of score-based diffusion generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by extending classical machine learning's single-risk minimization to Γ-maximin risk minimization over imprecise probabilities.

Method: The authors investigate property elicitation for IP, focusing on necessary conditions for elicitability and the role of Bayes pairs.

Result: They show that an elicitable IP-property corresponds to the standard property of the maximum Bayes risk distribution.

Conclusion: The work bridges property elicitation with imprecise probabilities, offering insights for multi-distribution learning.

Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution
can be determined by minimising a risk. We investigate a generalisation of
property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is
motivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine
learning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and
replaces it with $\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide
necessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we
explain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs --
the elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum
Bayes risk distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of BoN relies heavily on the quality of the proxy reward model, which can be unreliable. This work aims to address this limitation by studying SBoN.

Method: The paper introduces SBoN, a smoothed variant of BoN, and develops a theoretical framework to analyze its scaling behavior, KL divergence, and regret gap.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that SBoN reduces reward overoptimization, particularly when the proxy reward model is of low quality.

Conclusion: SBoN offers a more robust alternative to BoN by smoothing the selection process, improving performance under imperfect proxy rewards.

Abstract: A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative
models is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference
policy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is
selected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL
tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the
proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a
smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical
framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by
providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference
policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of
samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true
reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and
empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward
overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.

*Priyanka Roy,Susanne Saminger-Platz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes an online regularized learning algorithm in RKHS for dependent processes, focusing on mixing coefficients to measure dependence. It provides probabilistic bounds and convergence rates for exponential and polynomial decay cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the performance of online learning algorithms in RKHS under dependent data, particularly for stationary Markov chains, by leveraging mixing coefficients.

Method: The study uses mixing coefficients (ϕ- and β-) to characterize dependence in strictly stationary Markov chains and derives probabilistic upper bounds and convergence rates.

Result: Probabilistic upper bounds and convergence rates are established for both exponential and polynomial decay of mixing coefficients.

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical guarantees for online learning in RKHS under dependent processes, with explicit rates for different decay scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an online regularized learning algorithm in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on a class of dependent
processes. We choose such a process where the degree of dependence is measured
by mixing coefficients. As a representative example, we analyze a strictly
stationary Markov chain, where the dependence structure is characterized by the
\(\phi\)- and \(\beta\)-mixing coefficients. Under these assumptions, we derive
probabilistic upper bounds as well as convergence rates for both the
exponential and polynomial decay of the mixing coefficients.

*Arturo Castellanos,Anna Korba,Pavlo Mozharovskyi,Hicham Janati*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new distance metric between probability distributions is introduced, leveraging Schatten norms of kernel covariance operators, offering advantages over MMD and Wasserstein distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing distance metrics (e.g., MMD's lack of discriminative power and sensitivity to hyperparameters) while retaining benefits of kernel methods.

Method: Proposes a distance metric based on Schatten norms of kernel covariance operators, with an algorithm for practical computation using an extended kernel matrix.

Result: The new distance is more discriminative and robust to hyperparameters than MMD, avoids the curse of dimensionality, and is validated in Bayesian computation and particle flow simulations.

Conclusion: The introduced distance metric provides a practical and theoretically sound alternative to existing methods, with demonstrated advantages in robustness and discriminative power.

Abstract: Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many
statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative
modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that
compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We
show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be
framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In
particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more
discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it
benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the
curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to
compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix
for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those
advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under
contamination as well as particle flow simulations.

*Aime Bienfait Igiraneza,Christophe Fraser,Robert Hinch*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: PQ is a Bayesian quantifier for prevalence estimation, offering better precision and calibrated coverage than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of clarity on the ideal method for uncertainty quantification in prevalence estimation, balancing precision and coverage.

Method: Proposes Precise Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian approach, and tests it on simulated and real-world datasets.

Result: PQ outperforms existing methods in precision and coverage. Key factors influencing precision are classifier power, labeled dataset size, and unlabeled dataset size.

Conclusion: PQ provides improved uncertainty quantification in prevalence estimation, with insights into factors affecting precision.

Abstract: Unlike classification, whose goal is to estimate the class of each data point
in a dataset, prevalence estimation or quantification is a task that aims to
estimate the distribution of classes in a dataset. The two main tasks in
prevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the
training dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard
methods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping
and Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in
terms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e.
the confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise
Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing
quantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ
and present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through
these experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification
precision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of
the labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled
dataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights
into uncertainty quantification for quantification learning.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HC-FGNN improves QoS prediction by leveraging implicit user-user interactions in federated learning while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGNN-based QoS predictors miss implicit user-user interactions, limiting accuracy.

Method: HC-FGNN uses attention to amplify explicit graphs for high-order collaboration and lightweight message aggregation.

Result: HC-FGNN achieves high prediction accuracy and privacy protection in real-world QoS datasets.

Conclusion: HC-FGNN effectively balances QoS prediction accuracy and privacy in federated learning.

Abstract: Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) data crucial for cloud service selection,
where user privacy is a critical concern. Federated Graph Neural Networks
(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.
However, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device
training on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize
the implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes
a high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to
obtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it
magnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention
mechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit
user-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message
aggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive
experiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the
proposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and
privacy protection.

*Daghash K. Alqahtani,Maria A. Rodriguez,Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Hamid Rezatofighi,Adel N. Toosi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ECORE is a framework for optimizing energy and accuracy in edge-based object detection by dynamically routing tasks to suitable edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing reduces latency for real-time vision tasks, but resource constraints require balancing energy and accuracy.

Method: ECORE integrates dynamic routing strategies (estimation-based and greedy selection) to direct tasks to optimal edge device-model pairs.

Result: ECORE reduces energy by 45% and latency by 49%, with only a 2% accuracy drop compared to accuracy-focused methods.

Conclusion: ECORE effectively balances energy efficiency and detection performance for edge-based object detection.

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed
context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by
45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy
compared to accuracy-centric methods.

TL;DR: Proposes efficient Federated Learning (FL) methods (FedASMU and FedSSMU) leveraging downlink bandwidth for timely updates, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance FL by addressing update dissemination delays and improving model accuracy and efficiency in distributed data settings.

Method: Introduces asynchronous (FedASMU) and synchronous (FedSSMU) frameworks with dynamic model aggregation and adaptive model adjustment.

Result: FedASMU and FedSSMU outperform baselines, achieving up to 145.87% higher accuracy and 97.59% better efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve FL performance, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the
management of distributed data, marked by significant advancements in recent
years. In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on
additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination.
Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework,
introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which
integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side,
we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model
aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global
model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device
side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the
latest global model with local models during training to further elevate
accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context,
referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of
our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and
five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly
surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and
efficiency (up to 97.59%).

TL;DR: RBWE, an offline RL framework for bandwidth estimation, reduces errors and improves QoE in RTC by integrating Q-ensemble and a fallback mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BWE methods lack adaptability, and online RL is costly. Offline RL offers a solution but faces challenges like OOD actions and deployment reliability.

Method: RBWE uses Q-ensemble and Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD risks, with a fallback to heuristic methods for stability.

Result: RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and improves 10th percentile QoE by 18.6%.

Conclusion: RBWE is effective for real-world RTC, balancing robustness and performance.

Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication
(RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability
under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from
high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which
leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a
promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD)
actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable
deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust
bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble
(an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD
risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment
stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty.
Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and
improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.

*Zeinab Hassani,Davud Mohammadpur,Hossein Safari*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper explores LSTM and DLSTM networks with an ensemble algorithm for solar flare prediction, finding DLSTM on regularized time series outperforms others with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve solar flare forecasting by addressing the Sun's complex behavior and class imbalance in datasets.

Method: Uses LSTM and DLSTM on irregular and regularized time series, employs sliding windows and resampling, and integrates an ensemble approach.

Result: DLSTM with ensemble on regularized data achieves TSS (0.74), recall (0.95), and AUC (0.87), outperforming other models.

Conclusion: Advanced ML techniques like DLSTM enhance solar flare prediction, emphasizing the need for diverse solar cycle phases and resampling.

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to
predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog.
The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among
approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified,
highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex,
self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is
employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized
flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare
activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class
imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on
sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while
LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding
windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics,
particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)
in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an
ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering
more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models
trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is
attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal
components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the
potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction
and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and
resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

*Lunjia Hu,Salil Vadhan*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified pseudoentropy characterization, generalizing and strengthening previous results for computational hardness and randomness, using weight-restricted calibration for exponential improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the relationship between computational hardness and randomness, and to enhance existing pseudoentropy characterizations with a universal function.

Method: Uses weight-restricted calibration and computational indistinguishability to generalize entropy notions, improving on prior work.

Result: Achieves a unified pseudoentropy characterization with exponential improvement in complexity dependency on alphabet size.

Conclusion: Weight-restricted calibration is powerful for pseudoentropy, and exponential dependency on alphabet size is unavoidable for multicalibration.

Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise
demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and
computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization
that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and
non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general
family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon
entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the
characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved
by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational
hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is
that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on
algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability
(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving
pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates
the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic
Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)
and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to
achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet
size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and
Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show
that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for
multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoRe is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on static analysis tasks, revealing gaps in semantic reasoning despite strong performance in dependency identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end outcomes, neglecting deeper program semantic reasoning in LLMs.

Method: CoRe includes 12,553 task instances across C/C++, Java, and Python, using a semantics-aware sampling strategy for diversity and complexity.

Result: LLMs perform well on dependency identification but struggle with deeper semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: CoRe highlights key challenges in LLMs' code reasoning, suggesting areas for improvement, such as handling complex control structures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse software
engineering domains, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability
detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code
patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program
elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,
such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models
ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,
a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on
fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning
data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs
written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning
complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects
targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.
We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at
identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative
analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and
backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper combines LLMs and fuzz testing to generate weakest preconditions (WPs) for programs, using Fuzzing Guidance (FG) to refine LLM outputs with execution feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating WPs is crucial for verification and error checking, but manual methods are labor-intensive. Automating this with LLMs and fuzz testing can improve efficiency.

Method: Proposes FG, which uses fuzz testing to validate and refine candidate WPs generated by LLMs, leveraging execution feedback for context refinement.

Result: Experiments on Java array programs show LLMs can produce viable WPs, and FG enhances their accuracy.

Conclusion: The combination of LLMs and FG is effective for WP generation, offering a practical enhancement to traditional methods.

Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of
initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a
given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical
applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz
testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing
Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using
program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking
the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back
to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark
set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs
are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be
practically enhanced through FG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs on code lack diversity, complexity, and controllability, failing to reflect real-world engineering workflows.

Method: CorePipe automates repository conversion into test cases, while CoreCodeBench offers configurable multi-scenario benchmarks with atomic and composite questions.

Result: Experiments with 16 LLMs show varying capabilities, providing insights into their performance in engineering contexts.

Conclusion: CoreCodeBench and CorePipe enhance LLM evaluation for real-world engineering projects, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer
multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The

TL;DR: ASSURE is a modular automated testing framework for AI-powered browser extensions, addressing challenges like non-deterministic behavior and context-sensitivity. It improves testing throughput and identifies critical issues efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional testing methods fail to address the unique challenges of LLM-powered browser extensions, such as non-deterministic behavior and complex web integration.

Method: ASSURE includes a test case generation engine, an execution framework for web-AI interactions, and a validation pipeline for behavioral consistency and security.

Result: ASSURE identified 531 issues in six extensions, achieving 6.4x faster testing and detecting vulnerabilities in 12.4 minutes on average.

Conclusion: ASSURE provides a practical, comprehensive solution for testing AI-powered browser extensions, enhancing reliability and security.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into browser extensions has
revolutionized web browsing, enabling sophisticated functionalities like
content summarization, intelligent translation, and context-aware writing
assistance. However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented
challenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension
testing approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior,
context-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to
LLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate
in isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in
effective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a
modular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered
browser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular
test case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing
scenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex
interactions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior,
and (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates
behavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact
output matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions
demonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning
security vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content
alignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: OASBuilder automates the conversion of unstructured API documentation into machine-readable OpenAPI specifications using a pipeline combining LLMs and rule-based algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual conversion of API documentation into structured formats is time-consuming and inefficient.

Method: OASBuilder integrates large language models and rule-based algorithms, guided by domain knowledge, to transform API documentation.

Result: The framework generalizes well across hundreds of APIs, producing valid OpenAPI specifications that capture most original documentation details.

Conclusion: OASBuilder successfully automates API specification generation, saving manual effort and enhancing accessibility for AI tools.

Abstract: AI agents and business automation tools interacting with external web
services require standardized, machine-readable information about their APIs in
the form of API specifications. However, the information about APIs available
online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation,
requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into
a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel
framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into
consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a
carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based
algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of
documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes
well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that
encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder
has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving
thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise
APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.

### [353] [TigAug: Data Augmentation for Testing Traffic Light Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05932)
*You Lu,Dingji Wang,Kaifeng Huang,Bihuan Chen,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TigAug, a method for automatically augmenting labeled traffic light images to test and improve traffic light detection models in autonomous driving systems. It addresses the limitations of manual data collection by using metamorphic relations and transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for testing traffic light detection models rely on manual data collection, which is labor-intensive and lacks diversity. There's a need for automated solutions to ensure reliability and robustness.

Method: TigAug constructs two families of metamorphic relations and three families of transformations based on weather, camera, and traffic light properties. It uses augmented images to test and retrain models.

Result: Experiments show TigAug is effective in testing models, efficient in synthesizing images, and produces images with acceptable naturalness.

Conclusion: TigAug provides a scalable and automated solution for enhancing traffic light detection models in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

### [354] [Search-based Selection of Metamorphic Relations for Optimized Robustness Testing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05565)
*Sangwon Hyun,Shaukat Ali,M. Ali Babar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a search-based approach to optimize Metamorphic Relations (MRs) for testing LLM robustness, using four algorithms and identifying dominant MRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MR-based testing for LLMs lacks scalability and efficiency, and existing studies focus narrowly on single perturbations.

Method: A search-based approach with four algorithms (Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, MOEA/D) is used to optimize MR groups for failure detection and cost efficiency.

Result: MOEA/D performed best, and dominant MRs (silver bullets) were identified for confusing LLMs across tasks.

Conclusion: The research advances optimized testing for LLM robustness and highlights search-based solutions.

Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing
that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate
the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing
still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization
of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically
generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,
most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in
their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based
approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and
minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the
combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in
the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented
four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel
encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We
conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a
random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our
statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the
MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM
robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM
robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs
across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research
sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides
insights into search-based solutions.

*Yuxin Zhang,Jiahao Yang,Zhe Chen,Wenjun Zhu,Jin Zhao,Yue Gao*

TL;DR: SpaceVerse is a satellite-ground synergistic LVLM system for real-time Earth observation, improving accuracy by 31.2% and reducing latency by 51.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of fast satellite motion, brief contact windows, and large image sizes to enable real-time applications like disaster monitoring.

Method: Deploy compact LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks and regular LVLMs on ground stations for intensive tasks, with a co-design framework for efficient data processing.

Result: Achieves 31.2% higher accuracy and 51.2% lower latency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SpaceVerse effectively enables near real-time Earth observation by optimizing LVLM deployment and data processing.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis
capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in
the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station
(GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download
challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g.,
disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM
in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground
synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact
LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs
to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and
communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network
and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite
inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission,
separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite
constellations and datasets, achieving a 31.2% average gain in accuracy and a
51.2% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Intra-DP is a system for efficient DNN inference on mobile devices using MEC, reducing latency by 50% and energy by 75% via parallel computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in deploying DNNs on mobile devices due to limited resources and battery life, with existing MEC solutions facing transmission bottlenecks.

Method: Intra-DP uses parallel computing with local operators, decomposing operations into sub-operations to overlap computation and transmission.

Result: Reduces latency by 50% and energy consumption by 75% compared to baselines, without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Intra-DP effectively addresses MEC transmission bottlenecks, enabling fast and energy-efficient DNN inference.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices
presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time
performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources
and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative
inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches
primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant
transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations.
To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance
collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP
employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e.,
operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the
convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into
several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and
transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP
mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient
inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference
latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

### [358] [Minimal Deterministic Echo State Networks Outperform Random Reservoirs in Learning Chaotic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06050)
*Francesco Martinuzzi*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: Deterministic echo state networks (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in chaotic attractor reconstruction, reducing error by 41% and offering robustness and hyperparameter reusability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ESNs are sensitive to hyperparameters and random initialization, limiting their reliability in modeling chaotic systems.

Method: MESNs use deterministic rules and simple topologies, tested on 90 chaotic systems with 10 reservoir initializations.

Result: MESNs achieve up to 41% lower error, exhibit less variability, and allow hyperparameter reuse.

Conclusion: Structured simplicity in ESN design surpasses stochastic complexity for chaotic dynamics.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used to model chaotic systems. Among ML
approaches, echo state networks (ESNs) have received considerable attention due
to their simple construction and fast training. However, ESN performance is
highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices and to its random initialization. In
this work, we demonstrate that ESNs constructed using deterministic rules and
simple topologies (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in the task of chaotic
attractor reconstruction. We use a dataset of more than 90 chaotic systems to
benchmark 10 different minimal deterministic reservoir initializations. We find
that MESNs obtain up to a 41% reduction in error compared to standard ESNs.
Furthermore, we show that the MESNs are more robust, exhibiting less inter-run
variation, and have the ability to reuse hyperparameters across different
systems. Our results illustrate how structured simplicity in ESN design can
outperform stochastic complexity in learning chaotic dynamics.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextASR-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate contextual speech recognition, leveraging LLMs and LALMs to address limitations of conventional ASR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ASR evaluations lack context modeling, and recent advancements in LLMs/LALMs necessitate a benchmark to assess generality and intelligence in ASR systems.

Method: Proposes ContextASR-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 40,000 data entries across 10 domains, evaluating performance with and without contextual information, including named entity recognition.

Result: LALMs, with superior world knowledge and context learning, significantly outperform conventional ASR models.

Conclusion: ContextASR-Bench fills a critical gap in ASR evaluation, demonstrating the superiority of LALMs in contextual speech recognition.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet
prior evaluative efforts have largely been restricted to contextless paradigms.
This constraint stems from the limited proficiency of conventional ASR models
in context modeling and their deficiency in memory and reasoning based on world
knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly
enhanced the visibility of general artificial intelligence capabilities.
Consequently, there exists a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate
both the generality and intelligence of ASR systems. To address this gap, we
propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to
assess contextual speech recognition. This benchmark encompasses up to 40,000
data entries across over 10 domains, enabling a thorough evaluation of model
performance in scenarios that omit or incorporate coarse-grained or
fine-grained contextual information. Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR
evaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in
recognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive
evaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context
learning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.

*Gabriel P. Langlois,Jérôme Darbon*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an exact and efficient algorithm for Basis Pursuit Denoising (BPDN) using differential inclusions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BPDN algorithms trade efficiency for accuracy, making them ineffective for high-dimensional applications requiring precise solutions quickly.

Method: The dual problem of BPDN is transformed into calculating the trajectory of an integrable projected dynamical system, enabling exact solutions up to machine precision.

Result: Numerical experiments show the algorithm is faster and more accurate than current methods, also enabling rigorous homotopy and greedy algorithms.

Conclusion: The approach can be extended to solve other polyhedral-constrained optimization problems, offering broader applicability.

Abstract: Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is a cornerstone of compressive sensing,
statistics and machine learning. While various algorithms for BPDN have been
proposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor
efficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art
algorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require
accurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this
work, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for
BPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection
principle from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of
BPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \emph{integrable} projected
dynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be
computed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically
up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and
very fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show
that the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and
data) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm
for BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions
to basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time. Beyond this work, we expect that
our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate
solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.

### [362] [On the Inherent Privacy of Zeroth Order Projected Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05610)
*Devansh Gupta,Meisam Razaviyayn,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether the inherent noise in zeroth-order optimization methods is sufficient for differential privacy, showing it's not always the case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether the randomness in zeroth-order methods alone ensures differential privacy, as questioned by recent research.

Method: Analyzes oracle-based optimization algorithms, focusing on Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD) with fixed and random initializations.

Result: Demonstrates that ZO-GD is not differentially private for strongly convex functions with fixed initialization, and privacy loss grows superlinearly with iterations for convex functions.

Conclusion: The inherent noise in zeroth-order methods is insufficient for differential privacy in certain cases, highlighting the need for additional mechanisms.

Abstract: Differentially private zeroth-order optimization methods have recently gained
popularity in private fine tuning of machine learning models due to their
reduced memory requirements. Current approaches for privatizing zeroth-order
methods rely on adding Gaussian noise to the estimated zeroth-order gradients.
However, since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently
random, researchers including Tang et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2024a) have
raised an important question: is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators
sufficient to ensure the overall differential privacy of the algorithm? This
work settles this question for a class of oracle-based optimization algorithms
where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient estimates. In particular, we
show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly convex objective
functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD)
is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random
initialization and without revealing (initial and) intermediate iterates, the
privacy loss in ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when
minimizing convex objective functions.

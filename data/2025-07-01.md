### [1] [Robust Perspective Correction for Real-World Crack Evolution Tracking in Image-Based Structural Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22437)
*Xinxin Sun,Peter Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-informed alignment framework improves crack detection in SHM by adapting KAZE architecture, outperforming traditional methods with up to 90% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature detectors like SIFT and SURF are ineffective for thin crack localization due to high-frequency edge suppression, while lightweight alternatives like ORB and BRISK lack repeatability.

Method: The framework uses nonlinear anisotropic diffusion for crack-preserving scale space and RANSAC-based homography estimation for geometric correction, requiring no training or tuning.

Result: Validated on real-world images, the method reduces crack area and spine length errors by 70% and 90%, respectively, with sub-5% alignment error.

Conclusion: The approach is robust, interpretable, and lightweight, suitable for scalable deployment in SHM via UAVs and mobile platforms.

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

### [2] [Counting with Confidence: Accurate Pest Monitoring in Water Traps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22438)
*Xumin Gao,Mark Stevens,Grzegorz Cielniak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to evaluate pest counting confidence in images by combining counting results and environmental factors, improving accuracy over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pest counting models lack reliability assessment in real-world scenarios due to missing ground truth. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating counting confidence.

Method: Uses a pest detection network, image quality/complexity assessments, and pest distribution uniformity analysis. Introduces a multi-factor sensitivity analysis and adaptive DBSCAN clustering for evaluations. A regression model predicts final counting confidence.

Result: Reduces MSE by 31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study is the first to comprehensively evaluate counting confidence, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

### [3] [Modulated Diffusion: Accelerating Generative Modeling with Modulated Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22463)
*Weizhi Gao,Zhichao Hou,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang,Linyu Peng,Xiaorui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDiff accelerates diffusion models via modulated quantization and error compensation, reducing activation quantization from 8 to 3 bits without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computation cost in iterative sampling of diffusion models limits their efficiency. Existing acceleration techniques like caching and quantization have limitations in computation error and generation quality.

Method: Introduces Modulated Diffusion (MoDiff), a framework combining modulated quantization and error compensation to accelerate diffusion models.

Result: MoDiff reduces activation quantization from 8 to 3 bits without degrading performance, validated on CIFAR-10 and LSUN datasets.

Conclusion: MoDiff is a general, efficient framework for accelerating diffusion models, backed by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

### [4] [ViFusionTST: Deep Fusion of Time-Series Image Representations from Load Signals for Early Bed-Exit Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22498)
*Hao Liu,Yu Hu,Rakiba Rayhana,Ling Bai,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to predict bed-exit intent early using low-cost load cells and a dual-stream Swin Transformer, achieving high accuracy and F1 scores on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bed-related falls are a major cause of injury in healthcare settings, and existing alarms often trigger too late. Early prediction of bed-exit intent can prevent such falls.

Method: Four load cells under bed legs generate signals converted into images (RGB line plot and texture maps). ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer, processes and fuses these images using cross-attention.

Result: ViFusionTST achieved 0.885 accuracy and 0.794 F1 score on a six-month dataset from 95 beds, outperforming baselines in F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.

Conclusion: Image-based fusion of load-sensor signals is effective for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

### [5] [Scalable Dynamic Origin-Destination Demand Estimation Enhanced by High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22499)
*Jiachao Liu,Pablo Guarda,Koichiro Niinuma,Sean Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates satellite imagery with traditional traffic data for dynamic origin-destination demand estimation, improving accuracy and scalability in multi-class mesoscopic networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of sparse local traffic sensors by leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery for city-wide, consistent traffic data.

Method: Develop a computer vision pipeline for vehicle detection and map matching, then a computational graph-based model to calibrate network states using combined data sources.

Result: Out-of-sample tests show improved estimation performance, especially for sensor-less links, and real-world experiments confirm scalability for large networks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances demand estimation accuracy and is viable for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes.

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

### [6] [Visual-Semantic Knowledge Conflicts in Operating Rooms: Synthetic Data Curation for Surgical Risk Perception in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22500)
*Weiyi Zhao,Xiaoyu Tan,Liang Liu,Sijia Li,Youwei Song,Xihe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset (OR-VSKC) to address visual-semantic knowledge conflicts in MLLMs for surgical risk detection, improving performance on trained entities but showing limitations on untrained ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated operating room risk detection by addressing visual-semantic knowledge conflicts in MLLMs, which fail to identify visual safety violations despite understanding textual rules.

Method: Created a dataset of 34,000 synthetic images (and 214 human-annotated ones) depicting OR safety violations using diffusion models, then fine-tuned MLLMs on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning improved detection of trained conflict entities and generalized to new viewpoints, but performance on untrained entities remained poor.

Conclusion: The OR-VSKC dataset and benchmark are valuable for studying VS-KC, but comprehensive training is needed to address untrained entities.

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at
https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.

### [7] [How Can Multimodal Remote Sensing Datasets Transform Classification via SpatialNet-ViT?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22501)
*Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Manaswi Kulahara,Nipun Joshi,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialNet-ViT, a novel model combining Vision Transformers and Multi-Task Learning, addresses generalization challenges in remote sensing classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies focus on narrow tasks or datasets, limiting generalization across remote sensing classification challenges.

Method: Proposes SpatialNet-ViT, integrating Vision Transformers and Multi-Task Learning, with techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning.

Result: Improves classification accuracy and scalability by combining spatial awareness and contextual understanding.

Conclusion: The model enhances robustness and generalization across diverse remote sensing datasets.

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence
detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

### [8] [What Makes a Dribble Successful? Insights From 3D Pose Tracking Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22503)
*Michiel Schepers,Pieter Robberechts,Jan Van Haaren,Jesse Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses 3D pose tracking data to analyze dribbling in soccer, identifying balance and orientation as key predictors of success, improving on traditional 2D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D positional data lacks depth in evaluating dribbling skills, missing aspects like balance and orientation.

Method: Analyzed 1,736 dribbles from the 2022/23 Champions League using pose-based features derived from 3D tracking data.

Result: Balance and attacker-defender orientation alignment were key predictors of dribble success, enhancing model performance over 2D data.

Conclusion: 3D pose tracking provides deeper insights into dribbling, improving evaluation beyond traditional 2D methods.

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

### [9] [Patch2Loc: Learning to Localize Patches for Unsupervised Brain Lesion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22504)
*Hassan Baker,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch2Loc is an unsupervised method for detecting brain lesions in MRI by learning from normal patches and identifying abnormalities through prediction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid radiologists in diagnosing brain abnormalities without requiring annotated lesion data, leveraging unsupervised learning.

Method: Train a neural network to map patches to their spatial locations; detect abnormalities via higher prediction errors/variance, generating a heatmap for segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation on tumor detection in MRI datasets (BraTS2021, MSLUB, ATLAS, WMH).

Conclusion: Patch2Loc offers a robust, unsupervised solution for brain lesion segmentation, enhancing diagnostic tools for radiologists.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

### [10] [Weakly Supervised Object Segmentation by Background Conditional Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22505)
*Hassan Baker,Matthew S. Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for binary object segmentation using weak supervision (image-wise labels) and counterfactual backgrounds, tested on sonar and natural images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of expensive pixel-wise segmentation masks in specialized domains like sonar and biomedical imaging by leveraging weak supervision.

Method: Uses weak supervision (image-wise labels) and counterfactual backgrounds created by clustering and blending objects into targeted backgrounds. Training involves divergence loss between counterfactual and real images, plus a supervised loss for backgrounds.

Result: Outperforms unsupervised baselines on sonar images and shows reasonable performance on natural images without pretrained or adversarial networks.

Conclusion: The method is effective for binary segmentation in specialized domains with limited labeled data, avoiding complex architectures like GANs or pretrained models.

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

### [11] [FreeDNA: Endowing Domain Adaptation of Diffusion-Based Dense Prediction with Training-Free Domain Noise Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22509)
*Hang Xu,Jie Huang,Linjiang Huang,Dong Li,Yidi Liu,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free Domain Noise Alignment (DNA) method for Diffusion-based Dense Prediction (DDP) models to achieve domain adaptation by aligning noise statistics between domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that exposure bias in diffusion models causes domain shift, and noise prediction statistics can capture domain differences.

Method: The DNA approach aligns noise statistics during the diffusion sampling process, either using source domain statistics or high-confidence regions in source-free scenarios.

Result: The method effectively enhances domain adaptation for DDP models across four dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed DNA method is a training-free solution for domain adaptation in DDP models, validated by its performance on multiple tasks.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

### [12] [Lightning the Night with Generative Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22511)
*Tingting Zhou,Feng Zhang,Haoyang Fu,Baoxiang Pan,Renhe Zhang,Feng Lu,Zhixin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces RefDiff, a generative diffusion model, to retrieve visible light reflectance at night using thermal infrared data, improving accuracy and enabling uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visible light reflectance data is unavailable at night, limiting continuous weather monitoring. This study aims to overcome this gap.

Method: Uses multi-band thermal infrared data from FY4B's AGRI to develop RefDiff, a high-precision model for nighttime visible light reflectance retrieval.

Result: RefDiff achieves high accuracy (SSIM 0.90), especially in complex cloud areas, and performs comparably to daytime models.

Conclusion: The research advances nighttime visible light reflectance retrieval, expanding its applications in weather monitoring.

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

### [13] [Automated Defect Identification and Categorization in NDE 4.0 with the Application of Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22513)
*Aditya Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated framework for fault detection in radiography using a modified U-net model achieves high defect detection accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of sufficiently explained information and optimize virtual defect increase for contemporary radiography under NDE 4.0.

Method: Compiles 223 CR images of airplane welds, uses data expansion techniques, and trains a modified U-net model for semantic fault segmentation.

Result: Exceptional defect detection awareness with strong differentiating evidence, efficient processing of large images, and positive field evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework is viable, efficient, and promising as a support tool in testing cycles, despite equipment and software limitations.

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and

*Subhadip Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares Yolov11, Yolov12, and RF-DETR for container damage detection, finding RF-DETR superior for uncommon damages despite lower mAP scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of container damage is crucial for safety and logistics efficiency.

Method: Three computer vision models (Yolov11, Yolov12, RF-DETR) were trained on 278 annotated images and evaluated using mAP and precision.

Result: Yolov11 and Yolov12 had higher mAP@50 (81.9%) than RF-DETR (77.7%), but RF-DETR outperformed in detecting uncommon damages.

Conclusion: RF-DETR is better suited for detecting rare container damages, despite lower overall mAP scores.

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

*Prasen Kumar Sharma,Neeraj Matiyali,Siddharth Srivastava,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method, Preserve Anything, improves controlled image synthesis by addressing object preservation, semantic consistency, and user control in T2I generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with preserving multiple objects, semantic alignment, and scene composition control.

Method: Uses an N-channel ControlNet with object preservation, background guidance, and high-frequency overlay modules. Includes a benchmark dataset of 240K natural and 18K synthetic images.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (FID 15.26, CLIP-S 32.85) and significant user study improvements (25% prompt alignment, 19% photorealism).

Conclusion: Preserve Anything outperforms existing methods in fidelity, semantic alignment, and user control.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Seamless Interaction Dataset and models for understanding and generating dyadic behavioral dynamics in AI, aiming to enhance virtual agents and human-AI interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop socially intelligent AI by comprehending and generating dyadic behavioral dynamics (verbal and nonverbal signals) for better human-AI communication.

Method: Creation of the Seamless Interaction Dataset (4,000+ hours of face-to-face interactions) and development of models for generating dyadic motion gestures and facial expressions aligned with speech.

Result: Models can generate contextually relevant gestures and expressions, integrate with LLM speech, and adapt emotional responses and expressivity.

Conclusion: The work advances interactive virtual agents and multimodal content analysis, demonstrating potential for intuitive human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends Pix2Seq for videos, introducing an end-to-end video object detection method using discrete tokens for objects and 3D boxes/tracklets, improving scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional video detectors, such as loss sparsity, heuristics-based postprocessing, and reliance on 2D box linking.

Method: Represents objects as variable-length token sequences and outputs integrated 3D boxes/tracklets, enabling scalable input subsequences.

Result: Shows consistent improvement over Pix2Seq and competitiveness with state-of-the-art video detectors, despite computational bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional video object detection, with potential for multi-object tracking.

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMKD-CLIP is a biomedical foundation model that distills knowledge from multiple domain-specific CLIP models, achieving superior performance across diverse tasks without needing billion-scale raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale biomedical image-text corpora and fragmented data standards hinder the development of a unified biomedical foundation model.

Method: MMKD-CLIP uses a two-stage training pipeline: CLIP-style pretraining on 2.9M biomedical image-text pairs, followed by feature-level distillation from nine teacher models using 19.2M feature pairs.

Result: MMKD-CLIP outperforms all teacher models across 58 datasets and six task types, showing robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective approach for building high-performing biomedical foundation models under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving crop management and resource utilization in agriculture through accurate image segmentation of farmland anomalies.

Method: Integration of DAS Conv module in DeepLabV3, optimizing dilation rates and padding, with strategic skip connections for fine-grained feature capture.

Result: Outperforms baseline, matches SOTA transformer models on Agriculture Vision dataset, with 66% efficiency improvement.

Conclusion: Proposes a lightweight, efficient solution for high-quality semantic segmentation in agricultural remote sensing.

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIGHT is a multi-modal approach integrating linguistic, image, and geometric features to link text on historical maps, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text on historical maps is complex and varies in orientation, shape, and placement, making linking text fragments challenging. Existing methods neglect geometric information, which is crucial for map text.

Method: LIGHT combines geometry-aware embeddings (polygonal coordinates) with visual and linguistic features from LayoutLMv3, using a bi-directional learning strategy for reading-order prediction.

Result: LIGHT outperforms existing methods on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data.

Conclusion: Multi-modal learning (linguistic, visual, geometric) is effective for linking text on historical maps.

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMT, a hybrid framework combining bidirectional Mamba and transformer blocks, outperforms existing methods in fMRI-based phenotypic prediction by efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle to model complex fMRI data due to limitations in capturing long-range spatial and temporal dependencies.

Method: BrainMT uses a two-stage approach: (1) bidirectional Mamba block for global temporal interactions, and (2) transformer block for global spatial relationships.

Result: BrainMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sex prediction and cognitive intelligence prediction tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: BrainMT effectively addresses the limitations of current approaches, offering a robust solution for fMRI-based phenotypic prediction.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

TL;DR: Seg-R1 uses RL to enhance pixel-level understanding in LMMs for segmentation tasks, achieving strong performance and generalization without text supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pixel-level reasoning in LMMs using RL, focusing on segmentation tasks like COD and SOD.

Method: Introduces GRPO for RL-based training, enabling LMMs to generate prompts for SAM2 to produce masks.

Result: Achieves .873 S-measure on COD10K and strong zero-shot performance on referring/reasoning segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Pure RL training in Seg-R1 shows promise for open-world generalization and outperforms supervised models.

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

*Sotirios Panagiotis Chytas,Miso Choi,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Vikas Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the hallucination issue in Vision Language Models (VLMs) by proposing a lightweight module (ReCo) to mitigate the fading memory effect, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often hallucinate due to over-reliance on language and fading memory of visual input. The study aims to control this behavior.

Method: Proposes ReCo, a small trainable module based on geometric algebra and relational compositions, added atop VLMs without other modifications.

Result: ReCo improves performance on three widely used VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4) across benchmarks and complements other hallucination-reduction methods.

Conclusion: The lightweight ReCo module effectively mitigates the fading memory effect in VLMs, enhancing their reliability and performance.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

TL;DR: CaO$_2$ is a two-stage diffusion-based framework addressing inconsistencies in dataset distillation, achieving top performance on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based dataset distillation methods suffer from objective and condition inconsistencies, leading to misalignment with evaluation goals.

Method: Introduces Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage framework with probability-informed sample selection and latent representation refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, outperforming baselines by 2.3% accuracy on average.

Conclusion: CaO$_2$ effectively resolves inconsistencies in dataset distillation, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

*Jiang Yuan,JI Ma,Bo Wang,Guanzhou Ke,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LightBSR, a lightweight blind super-resolution model focusing on optimizing the discriminability of implicit degradation representation (IDR) using knowledge distillation and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IDE-BSR methods overlook IDR discriminability, complicating adaptation and increasing computational costs. LightBSR aims to address this by enhancing IDR discriminability efficiently.

Method: Uses a knowledge distillation framework with degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning (teacher stage) and feature alignment (student stage) to transfer degradation knowledge.

Result: LightBSR achieves high performance with minimal complexity across blind SR tasks, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Optimizing IDR discriminability is crucial for BSR; LightBSR offers a powerful, lightweight solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in articulated object motion analysis where point clouds vary due to occlusions or asynchronous sensor data, making point correspondence tracking unreliable.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussians as building blocks with time-dependent transformations (rotations, translations, scales) shared across time steps. Part segmentation and motion estimation are derived from point-Gaussian correspondences.

Result: Outperforms point correspondence-based methods, especially under occlusions, with a 13% improvement in part segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian-based representation is effective for joint part segmentation and motion estimation, handling occlusions and missing data robustly.

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

### [29] [Deterministic Object Pose Confidence Region Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22720)
*Jinghao Wang,Zhang Li,Zi Wang,Banglei Guan,Yang Shang,Qifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deterministic method for 6D pose confidence region estimation, addressing inefficiencies and inflated regions in sampling-based approaches. It uses inductive conformal prediction and the implicit function theorem for accurate, compact confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sampling-based methods for 6D pose confidence region estimation are inefficient and produce overly large regions, limiting practical use.

Method: The approach calibrates Gaussian keypoint distributions into 2D confidence regions using inductive conformal prediction, then propagates these into 6D pose regions via the implicit function theorem.

Result: The method achieves higher accuracy and faster computation, reducing confidence region volumes by up to 99.9% for rotations and 99.8% for translations.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers efficient, compact confidence regions for 6D pose estimation, outperforming sampling-based approaches in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

*Yu Zhang,Xi Zhang,Hualin zhou,Xinyuan Chen,Shang Gao,Hong Jia,Jianfei Yang,Yuankai Qi,Tao Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XTransfer is a novel method for efficient, modality-agnostic model transfer in edge systems, addressing issues like modality shift and high resource demands by repairing and recombining model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems faces challenges like limited sensor data, resource constraints, and poor adaptability due to modality shift.

Method: XTransfer uses model repairing to fix modality shift and layer recombining to create compact models from pre-trained layers.

Result: XTransfer outperforms baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing data collection, training, and deployment costs.

Conclusion: XTransfer offers a resource-efficient solution for human sensing tasks on edge systems, improving adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

*Dayong Su,Yafei Zhang,Huafeng Li,Jinxing Li,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFuse is a unified framework for multimodal medical image fusion that addresses misalignment and degradation by integrating alignment, restoration, and fusion into a single-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods assume high-quality, aligned images and fail with misaligned or degraded inputs. UniFuse aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: UniFuse uses degradation-aware prompt learning, Omni Unified Feature Representation with Spatial Mamba, and a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module with ALSN for joint optimization.

Result: Experiments show UniFuse outperforms existing methods in handling misaligned and degraded medical images.

Conclusion: UniFuse successfully unifies alignment, restoration, and fusion, offering a robust solution for multimodal medical image fusion.

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

*Yun Zhang,Feifan Chen,Na Li,Zhiwei Guo,Xu Wang,Fen Miao,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a deep learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method for colored point clouds, achieving superior PSNR gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the quality of large-scale and denser colored point clouds by jointly modeling geometry and attribute patterns.

Method: Introduces a JGAU framework with geometry and attribute up-sampling networks, coarse attribute up-sampling methods (GDWAI and DLAI), and an attribute enhancement module.

Result: Achieves PSNR gains of 2.11 to 2.47 decibels across four up-sampling rates (4x to 16x).

Conclusion: JGAU significantly improves colored point cloud up-sampling quality, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

*Jianing Zhang,Jiayi Zhu,Feiyu Ji,Xiaokang Yang,Xiaoyun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion (DMD) for metalens photography, using pretrained models to avoid large datasets. It includes tunable paths for detail generation and degradation suppression, validated with a MetaCamera.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metalenses face challenges like optical degradation and computational restoration difficulties, requiring precise calibration or large datasets. Current methods lack control, leading to artifacts.

Method: Proposes DMD with positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths for balance, pseudo data augmentation, a tunable decoder, and a SVDA module for degradation modeling. Validated with a MetaCamera.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image reconstruction.

Conclusion: DMD offers a robust, dataset-efficient solution for metalens photography with controlled trade-offs between fidelity and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and inefficiencies in collecting real-world robotic demonstrations hinder scalability, while existing simulation platforms struggle with the sim-to-real gap.

Method: RoboPearls uses 3D Gaussian Splatting, Incremental Semantic Distillation, 3D-NNFM Loss, and integrates LLMs and VLMs for automated, photo-realistic simulations.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets like RLBench and real-world robots show satisfactory simulation performance.

Conclusion: RoboPearls effectively addresses scalability and sim-to-real challenges in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of CNNs (local receptive fields) and Transformers (quadratic complexity) in video super-resolution by leveraging Mamba's linear complexity and large receptive fields.

Method: Introduces Spatial-to-Temporal and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks, a Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment module, and a Frequency Charbonnier-like loss for better alignment and high-frequency preservation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: VSRM provides a robust foundation for future research in video super-resolution.

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake datasets are not realistic enough to mimic real-world attacks, highlighting the need for more effective attack vectors and detection methods.

Method: The study develops PhonemeFake (PF), which manipulates critical speech segments using language reasoning. A bilevel detection model is also introduced to prioritize compute on manipulated regions.

Result: PF reduces human perception by 42% and benchmark accuracies by 94%. The detection model cuts EER by 91% and speeds up processing by 90% with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The paper presents PF as a scalable solution for realistic deepfake attacks and introduces an efficient detection model, advancing the field of deepfake research.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

*Yu Han,Zhiwei Huang,Yanting Zhang,Fangjun Ding,Shen Cai,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and camera views is introduced, addressing modality gaps and sparsity issues in single-frame LiDAR settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap between unstructured LiDAR point clouds and structured images, especially under sparse single-frame conditions, poses challenges for existing methods that rely on separate feature extraction and matching.

Method: The approach projects LiDAR intensity maps into 2D views and uses an attention-based detector-free matching network, enhanced by a repeatability scoring mechanism for reliability.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70, outperforming prior approaches even with single-frame LiDAR.

Conclusion: The detector-free framework effectively bridges the modality gap and improves robustness in sparse LiDAR settings without requiring multi-frame accumulation.

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

*Sicong Du,Jiarun Liu,Qifeng Chen,Hao-Xiang Chen,Tai-Jiang Mu,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGE-GS is a novel framework combining diffusion-based generation and reward-guided Gaussian integration to improve road structure reconstruction in sensor simulators, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete road structure scans from single-pass driving clips necessitate better reconstruction methods for sensor simulators, but current 3DGS techniques with diffusion priors introduce physical inconsistencies and inefficiencies.

Method: RGE-GS integrates a reward network to prioritize consistent patterns and a differentiated training strategy for adaptive Gaussian optimization, enhancing spatial stability and convergence.

Result: RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on public datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering improved performance and stability for expansive reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

TL;DR: CBM-HNMU improves interpretability and accuracy of deep learning models by refining concepts in the Concept Bottleneck Model and distilling corrected knowledge back into black-box models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are becoming more complex and less interpretable, with existing methods lacking effective interventions or global modifications.

Method: Uses the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) to approximate black-box reasoning, identifies and refines detrimental concepts globally, and distills corrected knowledge back into the model.

Result: Achieves up to 2.64% accuracy improvement and 1.03% average accuracy increase across multiple datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU effectively enhances both interpretability and performance of deep learning models by refining and transferring conceptual knowledge.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

*Byung Hyun Lee,Sungjin Lim,Seunggyu Lee,Dong Un Kang,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), a novel framework for selectively erasing target concepts in diffusion models while preserving diverse remaining concepts, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about inappropriate or trademarked concept generation in text-to-image diffusion models by improving concept erasure without distorting other concepts.

Method: Proposes CPE with nonlinear Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) and an attention anchoring loss, adversarially trained with learnable text embeddings for robustness.

Result: CPE effectively erases target concepts (e.g., celebrities, styles, explicit content) while preserving diverse remaining concepts and resisting adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: CPE advances concept erasure in diffusion models, offering superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

TL;DR: FreqDGT, a frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer, improves cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition by integrating frequency-adaptive processing, adaptive dynamic graph learning, and multi-scale temporal disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based emotion recognition is challenging due to individual variability and emotional response differences.

Method: FreqDGT combines frequency-adaptive processing (FAP), adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL), and multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) to address these challenges.

Result: FreqDGT significantly enhances cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, demonstrating robustness to individual differences.

Conclusion: The integration of frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical modeling in FreqDGT effectively addresses cross-subject EEG emotion recognition challenges.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is

Motivation: Traditional methods optimize a single bounding box, limiting effectiveness for applications needing multiple disjoint crops.

Method: Extends Fixed Aspect Ratio Cropping algorithm, dynamically adjusts attention thresholds, and removes selected crops without recomputing the saliency map.

Conclusion: Qualitative results are discussed, with potential for future datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping aims to extract the most visually salient regions

### [43] [Unleashing the Multi-View Fusion Potential: Noise Correction in VLM for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22817)
*Xingyilang Yin,Jiale Wang,Xi Yang,Mutian Xu,Xu Gu,Nannan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVOV3D improves open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding by reducing noise in 2D multi-view fusion without training, leveraging CLIP encoders and 3D geometric priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with diverse object categories due to limited 3D data and noisy 2D multi-view fusion.

Method: MVOV3D enhances 2D multi-view features using CLIP encoders and 3D geometric priors, avoiding training.

Result: Achieves 14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160, outperforming trained 3D networks.

Conclusion: MVOV3D effectively improves open-vocabulary 3D understanding by optimizing multi-view fusion.

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D
networks by a significant margin.

*Ramya Hebbalaguppe,Tamoghno Kandar,Abhinav Nagpal,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the miscalibration issue in test-time prompt tuning (TPT) for vision-language models (VLM) by proposing careful initialization of prompts using large language models (LLM) and a novel regularization loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TPT improves VLM accuracy but degrades confidence calibration, limiting its use in critical applications. The paper aims to mitigate this by better prompt initialization and regularization.

Method: Proposes (1) LLM-based prompt initialization to avoid overfitting and (2) a regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance and increase inter-class distance during TPT.

Result: Experiments on 15 datasets show improved calibration (ECE of 4.11 vs. 11.7 for vanilla TPT).

Conclusion: The method, TCA, effectively enhances calibration in TPT, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

*Alexander Gambashidze,Li Pengyi,Matvey Skripkin,Andrey Galichin,Anton Gusarov,Konstantin Sobolev,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a listener-augmented GRPO framework to improve generalization and reasoning accuracy in reward models for human visual preferences, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models for human visual preferences often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines.

Method: The proposed method uses a listener-augmented GRPO framework, where a frozen vision-language model re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal.

Result: The framework achieves 67.4% accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark, improves OOD performance by up to +6%, and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Listener-based rewards offer a scalable, data-efficient way to align vision-language models with nuanced human preferences.

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

*Shashikant Verma,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemFaceEdit introduces a method for localized facial editing in 3D-aware GANs by generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds, enabling precise control over geometry and appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-aware GANs lack localized editing capabilities, limiting their practicality for detailed facial modifications.

Method: SemFaceEdit uses two modules: Geometry for semantic radiance/occupancy fields and Appearance for RGB radiance, trained adversarially with latent codes for disentanglement.

Result: The method achieves superior performance in semantic field-based editing, with improved radiance field disentanglement.

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit enables precise facial editing while preserving other regions, outperforming existing methods in disentanglement and control.

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

### [47] [FOCUS: Fine-grained Optimization with Semantic Guided Understanding for Pedestrian Attributes Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22836)
*Hongyan An,Kuan Zhu,Xin He,Haiyun Guo,Chaoyang Zhao,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOCUS, a method for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) that adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features using Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) and Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE), enhanced by Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PAR methods rely on fixed regional features, which limit performance by compromising unique attribute patterns and failing to generalize to unseen attributes.

Method: Proposes FOCUS with MGMT for multi-granularity feature capture, AVFE for attribute-guided feature extraction, and RACL for consistent attention maps.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and generalization on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets.

Conclusion: FOCUS improves PAR by adaptively extracting fine-grained features, addressing limitations of fixed regional features.

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

Although significant progress has been made in ground-only scenarios, bridging
the aerial-ground domain gap remains a formidable challenge due to extreme
viewpoint differences, scale variations, and occlusions. Building upon the
achievements of the AG-ReID 2023 Challenge, this paper introduces the AG-VPReID
2025 Challenge - the first large-scale video-based competition focused on

million frames captured from UAVs, CCTV, and wearable cameras, the challenge
featured four international teams. These teams developed solutions ranging from
multi-stream architectures to transformer-based temporal reasoning and
physics-informed modeling. The leading approach, X-TFCLIP from UAM, attained
72.28% Rank-1 accuracy in the aerial-to-ground ReID setting and 70.77% in the

TL;DR: DMD-Net is a deep learning framework for mesh denoising using a dual-stream GCN and a Feature Guided Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mesh denoising problem with a robust, end-to-end deep learning solution that handles high noise levels effectively.

Method: Uses a dual-stream GCN (primal and dual graph) with a fusion block and a Feature Guided Transformer (feature extractor, transformer, denoiser) for denoising.

Result: Competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, robust to high noise levels.

Conclusion: DMD-Net is effective and robust for mesh denoising, with each component contributing to its success.

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaTIR unifies text-to-image retrieval (TIR) and referring expression segmentation (RES) for efficient search and accurate segmentation, using a two-stage framework with SAM 2 and Alpha-CLIP for offline mask generation and MLLM for reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TIR lacks interpretability, while RES is computationally expensive. MaTIR bridges this gap by combining both tasks.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Segmentation-aware retrieval using SAM 2 and Alpha-CLIP for offline mask generation. 2) Reranking and grounding with MLLM.

Result: Improved retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality on COCO and D$^3$ datasets.

Conclusion: MaTIR effectively unifies TIR and RES, offering scalable and accurate solutions for both tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework for surface defect detection, using region-aware CAM and pseudo-label training, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the reliance on large annotated datasets in defect detection by proposing a weakly supervised approach.

Method: Combines filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP) for refined target regions and a region-aware weighted module for spatial precision, followed by pseudo-label training.

Result: Superior performance on industrial defect datasets, bridging weakly supervised learning and high-precision segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial defect detection.

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

TL;DR: STR-Match is a training-free video editing algorithm using a novel STR score for spatiotemporally coherent edits, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing temporal inconsistency, motion distortion, and limited domain transformation in text-guided video editing.

Method: Leverages 2D spatial attention and 1D temporal modules in T2V diffusion models for latent optimization with a latent mask.

Result: Produces visually appealing, temporally consistent videos even under significant domain transformations.

Conclusion: STR-Match excels in visual quality and spatiotemporal consistency, surpassing current methods.

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

TL;DR: DeSa2VA introduces a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme to disentangle dynamic visual and static semantic features, improving segmentation accuracy via text pre-training and linear decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Sa2VA fuse features directly, entangling dynamic and static information, which degrades segmentation performance.

Method: DeSa2VA uses text pre-training for point-level prompts, linear projection to decouple features, and dynamic mask fusion for synergy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like image/video segmentation and question answering.

Conclusion: DeSa2VA effectively mitigates feature entanglement, enhancing accuracy across diverse vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric for semantic informativeness in images and texts using contrastive learning, redefining Information Gain for vision and language domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear representation of absolute semantic informativeness in contrastive learning and extend Information Gain to multimodal contexts.

Method: Proposes a semantic informativeness metric calculated via contrastive learning models (CLIP or SigLIP), measuring how conditioning on an image/text distorts associated distributions. Uses norm-based embedding metrics for efficiency.

Result: Strong correlation (R² 0.98-1.00) between the proposed metric and theoretical expectations. Low Information Gain scores correspond to placeholder icons.

Conclusion: The method efficiently quantifies semantic informativeness, is scalable, and compatible with open-weight models.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

TL;DR: CP-Guard is a defense framework for Collaborative Perception (CP) that detects and removes malicious agents by ensuring consensus among collaborators, using methods like PASAC and CCLoss, with adaptive thresholds for dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative Perception (CP) is vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents, necessitating a robust defense mechanism to ensure reliable multi-agent systems.

Method: Proposes CP-Guard, featuring PASAC for consensus sampling, CCLoss for discrepancy measurement, and adaptive thresholds for dynamic environments.

Result: Extensive experiments validate CP-Guard's effectiveness in detecting and eliminating malicious agents in CP systems.

Conclusion: CP-Guard provides a reliable, adaptive solution to secure CP systems against malicious attacks, enhancing overall perception performance.

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to scale Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) to high-resolution outputs using a shared implicit decoder, addressing limitations like quadratic growth in training time and local information propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCAs are limited to low-resolution grids due to computational and memory constraints, hindering their broader applicability.

Method: Pair NCA with a lightweight implicit decoder and propose novel loss functions for high-resolution tasks.

Result: Enables real-time full-HD outputs while preserving emergent properties, with efficient parallelizable inference.

Conclusion: The framework scales NCAs to high resolutions across various tasks and grid types with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

*Mai A. Shaaban,Tausifa Jan Saleem,Vijay Ram Papineni,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOTOR improves MedVQA by combining grounded captions and optimal transport for multimodal retrieval and re-ranking, outperforming existing methods by 6.45%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs for MedVQA often produce incorrect answers, and retrieval-augmented methods risk irrelevant context, especially neglecting visual/multimodal cues crucial for medical diagnosis.

Method: Proposes MOTOR, a multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach using grounded captions and optimal transport to align textual and visual context.

Result: MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 6.45%.

Conclusion: MOTOR effectively enhances retrieval relevance and accuracy in MedVQA by integrating multimodal context, validated by empirical and expert evaluations.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

*Yunzhe Shao,Xinyu Yi,Lu Yin,Shihui Guo,Junhai Yong,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagShield is a novel method to mitigate magnetic interference in sparse inertial MoCap systems by detecting and correcting disturbances using multi-IMU analysis and motion priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU systems suffer from orientation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting real-world usability.

Method: MagShield uses a 'detect-then-correct' approach: detecting disturbances via multi-IMU analysis and correcting errors with human motion priors.

Result: MagShield improves motion capture accuracy in disturbed environments and is compatible with various sparse inertial MoCap systems.

Conclusion: MagShield effectively addresses magnetic interference, enhancing the practicality of sparse inertial MoCap systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

### [60] [Attention to Burstiness: Low-Rank Bilinear Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22908)
*Yuzhu Wang,Manni Duan,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) adapts pre-trained ViTs using prompts but faces challenges due to non-Gaussian distributions in patch embeddings and projectors. Whitening these data improves learning, leading to Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT), which boosts accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The non-Gaussian distributions in patch embeddings and key/query projectors hinder prompt learning in VPT, motivating the need for whitening to improve performance.

Method: Proposes whitening data to de-correlate and equalize variance, then introduces Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT) with low-rank matrices for efficient prompt learning.

Result: BPT significantly accelerates tuning, improves accuracy (e.g., +25 points on CUB), and reduces parameters and computation.

Conclusion: BPT outperforms VPT methods, offering a more efficient and effective approach for adapting pre-trained ViTs.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

TL;DR: BiMi is a bilingual multimodal framework for detecting subtle misinformation in news media by analyzing localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies, outperforming baselines in accuracy and explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic multimodal misinformation, especially in bilingual news media, necessitates advanced detection tools to address localized edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies.

Method: BiMi combines region-level localization, cross-modal/lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation, enhanced by an online retrieval module and GRPO for interpretability.

Result: BiMi achieves +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: BiMi advances multilingual misinformation detection with superior performance and interpretability, supported by the BiMiBench dataset and GRPO.

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,
multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be
released.

*Shreyas Dixit,Ashhar Aziz,Shashwat Bajpai,Vasu Sharma,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PECCAVI is a new watermarking technique for AI-generated content, resistant to visual paraphrase attacks by embedding watermarks in Non-Melting Points (NMPs) and using multi-channel frequency domain methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of synthetic content and generative AI poses risks of disinformation. Current watermarking methods are vulnerable to tampering, especially from visual paraphrase attacks.

Method: PECCAVI embeds watermarks in NMPs (core semantic regions) and uses multi-channel frequency domain watermarking with noisy burnishing to prevent reverse-engineering.

Result: PECCAVI is the first distortion-free and attack-safe watermarking technique, resistant to visual paraphrase attacks.

Conclusion: PECCAVI offers a robust solution for watermarking AI-generated content, addressing vulnerabilities in existing methods, and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActAlign introduces a zero-shot framework for fine-grained video classification using sequence alignment with language-generated sub-action sequences, outperforming larger models without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of zero-shot fine-grained video classification where no video examples or temporal annotations exist for unseen classes, leveraging structured language priors.

Method: Uses a large language model to generate ordered sub-action sequences for each class, aligning them with video frames via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space.

Result: Achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas (human accuracy: 61.6%), outperforming larger models with 8x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Structured language priors combined with classical alignment techniques provide a scalable, general approach for fine-grained video understanding.

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FewCLIP introduces a probabilistic prototype calibration framework for GFSS, enhancing adaptability and generalization by refining CLIP prototypes with visual calibration and distribution regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods in GFSS are deterministic, limiting adaptability to diverse samples, especially for novel classes with few annotations.

Method: FewCLIP refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable visual calibration prototypes and introduces distribution regularization for uncertainty-aware learning.

Result: FewCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets in GFSS and class-incremental settings.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach of FewCLIP effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances generalization in few-shot semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

Conclusion: The work highlights the need to study VLM vulnerabilities and provides a robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, impacting real-world VLM security.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

Motivation: To provide structure-rich, high-density images for ML tasks, considering graphic similarity and composition patterns in piano music.

Method: Built with 24.8k grayscale images (128x512 pixels) from two scenarios: same composition type (Sonatinas) by different authors, and varied types by Franz Liszt. Includes metadata and unsegmented scores.

Result: A dataset of 24.8k formatted samples with additional metadata and raw materials for analysis.

Conclusion: VisionScores offers a valuable resource for ML in music, combining structured data with flexibility for further research.

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image
score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images
for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

TL;DR: AugPaint is a data augmentation framework using inpainting to generate synthetic medical image-label pairs from limited labeled data, improving segmentation performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited labeled medical data for segmentation tasks, which is laborious and expensive to collect.

Method: Utilizes latent diffusion models for inpainting, conditioning on cropped foreground areas during denoising to generate accurate synthetic image-label pairs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art label-efficient methods on four medical datasets (CT, MRI, skin imaging), significantly enhancing segmentation.

Conclusion: AugPaint effectively mitigates the scarcity of labeled data, offering a scalable solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation

*Hung Nguyen,An Le,Runfa Li,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoOpti3DGS reduces Gaussian proliferation in 3D Gaussian Splatting by using learnable wavelet transforms, maintaining visual quality while improving memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory and bandwidth strain caused by the growing set of Gaussian primitives in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Uses learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transforms with fixed low-pass and learnable high-pass filters, activated by an orthogonality loss for coarse-to-fine refinement.

Result: Produces sparser scene representations, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and integrates with existing 3DGS frameworks.

Conclusion: AutoOpti3DGS effectively balances visual fidelity and memory efficiency in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ovis-U1 is a 3B-parameter unified model excelling in multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate multimodal understanding, generation, and editing into a single model for enhanced performance.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based visual decoder and bidirectional token refiner, trained with a unified approach starting from a language model.

Result: Achieves top scores on benchmarks like OpenCompass (69.6), DPG-Bench (83.72), and ImgEdit-Bench (4.00).

Conclusion: Ovis-U1 advances multimodal capabilities, setting a new benchmark for unified models.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

### [74] [Empowering Small VLMs to Think with Dynamic Memorization and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23061)
*Jiazhen Liu,Yuchuan Deng,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME is a new training paradigm for small-scale vision-language models (SVLMs) that dynamically switches between memorization (SFT) and exploration (RLVR) modes to enhance thinking reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SFT and RLVR are too demanding for SVLMs, causing pseudo thinking and advantage collapse, limiting their reliability and performance.

Method: DyME dynamically alternates between SFT (for memorization) and RLVR (for exploration) during training to optimize updates.

Result: DyME consistently balances memorization and exploration, significantly improving SVLM performance across domains.

Conclusion: DyME effectively enhances SVLMs' thinking capabilities, offering a practical solution for their limitations.

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

### [75] [CoreMark: Toward Robust and Universal Text Watermarking Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23066)
*Jiale Meng,Yiming Li,Zheming Lu,Zewei He,Hao Luo,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoreMark introduces a novel text watermarking framework using CORE segments for robust, generalizable, and imperceptible data embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in text watermarking like robustness, generalizability, and imperceptibility.

Method: Uses CORE segments for embedding, dynamically selects robust characters, and modulates embedding strength based on font size.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in resisting attacks (screenshot, print-scan, print-camera) while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: CoreMark is a highly effective and adaptable text watermarking solution.

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised pipeline for 3D braided hair reconstruction from single-view images, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with the intricate structure of braided hair, focusing mainly on loose hairstyles.

Method: Uses a synthetic braid model inspired by braid theory to capture complex intertwined structures.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, realism, and efficiency.

Conclusion: Supports expressive hairstyle modeling in digital humans effectively.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images remains a
challenging task due to the intricate interwoven structure and complex
topologies of braids. Existing strand-based hair reconstruction methods
typically focus on loose hairstyles and often struggle to capture the
fine-grained geometry of braided hair. In this paper, we propose a novel
unsupervised pipeline for efficiently reconstructing 3D braided hair from
single-view RGB images. Leveraging a synthetic braid model inspired by braid
theory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of
braids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, providing superior accuracy, realism, and
efficiency in reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles, supporting expressive

*Yu Zheng,Boyang Gong,Fanye Kong,Yueqi Duan,Bingyao Yu,Wenzhao Zheng,Lei Chen,Jiwen Lu,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDAL is a method for open-world model attribution that uses causal relationships to decouple discriminative artifacts from biases, improving generalization to unseen attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on handcrafted designs prone to spurious correlations and struggle with novel attacks in open-world scenarios.

Method: CDAL models causal relationships between attentional traces and attribution, counterfactually decoupling artifacts from biases to quantify attention quality.

Result: CDAL improves state-of-the-art models significantly, especially for unseen attacks, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: CDAL effectively generalizes to novel attacks by focusing on essential generation patterns, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

### [78] [Dynamic Contrastive Learning for Hierarchical Retrieval: A Case Study of Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23077)
*Suofei Zhang,Xinxin Wang,Xiaofu Wu,Quan Zhou,Haifeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) and a benchmark (DA-Campus) to address the lack of contextual information in existing methods. It proposes Dynamic Contrastive Learning (DyCL) for hierarchical retrieval, outperforming traditional metric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on accuracy but lack contextual understanding and error minimization in cross-view geo-localization.

Method: Proposes DyCL, a contrastive learning framework for hierarchical retrieval, tested on the DA-Campus benchmark.

Result: DyCL improves hierarchical retrieval and geo-localization accuracy, complementing multi-scale metric learning.

Conclusion: DyCL effectively addresses DACVGL, offering a novel approach for cross-view geo-localization with superior performance.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FMC-Net, a frequency-enhanced multi-granularity context network, to improve vertebrae segmentation in 3D CT and MRI images by addressing image blurring and distinguishing similar vertebrae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with image blurring and distinguishing similar vertebrae in spinal structures, limiting segmentation accuracy.

Method: FMC-Net uses wavelet transform for lossless downsampling, processes high and low-frequency components separately with HFR and MG-SSM, and leverages multi-granularity contexts.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on CT and MRI datasets.

Conclusion: FMC-Net effectively improves vertebrae segmentation accuracy by addressing key challenges, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

### [80] [Where, What, Why: Towards Explainable Driver Attention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23088)
*Yuchen Zhou,Jiayu Tang,Xiaoyan Xiao,Yueyao Lin,Linkai Liu,Zipeng Guo,Hao Fei,Xiaobo Xia,Chao Gou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a task paradigm predicting spatial attention, semantics, and cognitive reasoning in driving. It presents W3DA, a dataset with semantic and causal annotations, and LLada, a framework combining pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict spatial attention but lack understanding of cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in driving contexts.

Method: Proposes W3DA dataset with detailed annotations and LLada, a framework unifying pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive reasoning.

Result: LLada shows robust generalization across datasets and driving conditions.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of driver attention mechanisms, benefiting autonomous driving, driver training, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

*Jihun Kim,Hoyong Kwon,Hyeokjun Kweon,Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-TTA improves SAM by adapting it per-sample using user interactions, partitioning cues for localized updates, and merging models for better performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles in specialized domains and complex scenarios like camouflaged objects, needing better adaptation.

Method: DC-TTA uses a Divide-and-Conquer strategy, partitioning user clicks into subsets for independent TTA, then merging models.

Result: Outperforms SAM's zero-shot and conventional TTA methods, handling complex tasks with fewer interactions and higher accuracy.

Conclusion: DC-TTA effectively enhances SAM's performance in challenging scenarios through localized adaptation and merging.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

*Ryo Ishiyama,Shinnosuke Matsuo,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework simplifies multi-stroke Chinese/Japanese characters by removing strokes while maintaining legibility, aiding non-native learners and font design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce learning barriers for non-native speakers and improve font design and communication systems by simplifying complex characters.

Method: Uses a character recognition model to assess and remove strokes with minimal impact on legibility, tested on 1,256 character classes.

Result: Many characters remain distinguishable even after multiple strokes are removed, indicating potential for formalized simplification.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for systematic character simplification without compromising legibility.

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement Framework (CVC-RF) improves carotid plaque grading by addressing representation learning and class feature differences, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is crucial for assessing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks, but current deep learning methods neglect representation learning and class feature differences.

Method: Proposes CVC-RF with center-memory contrastive loss, cascaded down-sampling attention, and mixture-of-experts weighting for multi-level refinement.

Result: CVC-RF achieves state-of-the-art performance in CPG by effectively modeling global features.

Conclusion: The framework enhances CPG accuracy through multi-level refinement, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

*Haonan Chen,Hong Liu,Yuping Luo,Liang Wang,Nan Yang,Furu Wei,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCa transforms pre-trained VLMs into bidirectional multimodal embedding models via a two-stage framework, addressing limitations of current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal embedding models face suboptimal causal attention, scalability issues, and limited training diversity.

Method: MoCa uses Modality-aware Continual Pre-training and Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning to enhance bidirectional reasoning and leverage diverse data.

Result: MoCa achieves state-of-the-art results on MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks and shows strong scalability.

Conclusion: MoCa effectively addresses key limitations in multimodal embedding models, improving performance and scalability.

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

TL;DR: The paper introduces R$^2$S, a reasoning-based segmentation framework, and 3D ReasonSeg dataset to enhance spatial reasoning in point cloud perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex spatial reasoning tasks despite detailed 3D point cloud data.

Method: R$^2$S decomposes spatial reasoning into identifying relevant elements and processing instructions using visual priors.

Result: R$^^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg improve spatial reasoning in point cloud perception, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The framework and dataset serve as a new baseline for future work in 3D point cloud perception.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for detecting and explaining art plagiarism by retrieving visually similar authentic artworks, using a dataset of paintings and AI-synthesized plagiarized versions. Baseline and finetuned DINOv2 models are compared, showing trade-offs between accuracy and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect artists' copyrights and intellectual property by improving the detection and explanation of plagiarized paintings.

Method: Construct a dataset of paintings and AI-synthesized plagiarized versions. Use DINOv2 for baseline retrieval and classification, then finetune it with metric learning for improved retrieval.

Result: Baseline achieves 97.2% recognition accuracy but low retrieval precision (29.0% AP). Finetuning improves retrieval by 12% AP but reduces accuracy to 92.7%.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between accuracy and retrieval performance, suggesting future research directions to balance both.

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoboScape is a physics-informed world model that improves video generation for robotic scenarios by integrating 3D geometry and motion dynamics, enhancing realism and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied world models lack physical awareness, leading to unrealistic video generation in contact-rich robotic scenarios.

Method: RoboScape jointly learns RGB video generation and physics knowledge through temporal depth prediction and keypoint dynamics learning.

Result: RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and physical plausibility, validated in downstream robotic applications.

Conclusion: RoboScape advances embodied intelligence research by efficiently integrating physics into world models.

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material

*Shiyu Wu,Mingzhen Sun,Weining Wang,Yequan Wang,Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualPrompter refines user inputs for diffusion models to improve text-image alignment without training, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between user-provided prompts and model-preferred prompts, ensuring semantic alignment in generated images.

Method: Uses a self-reflection module to identify missing concepts and a prompt optimization mechanism for fine-grained revisions.

Result: Achieves top performance on text-image alignment benchmarks and is adaptable to various models.

Conclusion: VisualPrompter effectively enhances prompt quality and semantic alignment in diffusion models.

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

*Xinyue Liang,Zhiyuan Ma,Lingchen Sun,Yanjun Guo,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignCVC introduces a distribution alignment framework to improve cross-view consistency in single-image-to-3D generation, enhancing quality and speeding up inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with noisy and unstable reconstruction outputs, limiting cross-view consistency (CVC) improvement in single-image-to-3D tasks.

Method: AlignCVC aligns generated and reconstructed multi-view distributions with ground-truth using a soft-hard alignment strategy, distinct for generation and reconstruction models.

Result: The method improves generation quality, achieves strong CVC, and accelerates inference to as few as 4 steps.

Conclusion: AlignCVC effectively integrates with various models, demonstrating superior performance in single-image-to-3D generation.

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

*Vladislav Bargatin,Egor Chistov,Alexander Yakovenko,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEMFOF is a memory-efficient multi-frame optical flow method that balances accuracy and GPU memory usage, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high GPU memory consumption in optical flow estimation, especially for high-resolution inputs, without compromising accuracy.

Method: Revisits RAFT-like architectures, integrates reduced correlation volumes, high-resolution training, and multi-frame estimation.

Result: Outperforms alternatives in accuracy and efficiency, ranking first on benchmarks like Spring, Sintel, and KITTI-2015.

Conclusion: MEMFOF is robust for high-resolution flow estimation, offering a practical solution with low memory requirements.

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

### [91] [Dynamic View Synthesis from Small Camera Motion Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23153)
*Huiqiang Sun,Xingyi Li,Juewen Peng,Liao Shen,Zhiguo Cao,Ke Xian,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in novel view synthesis for dynamic 3D scenes with small camera motion, proposing a Distribution-based Depth Regularization (DDR) and camera parameter learning to improve geometry representation and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based methods struggle with limited or stationary camera motion, leading to incorrect scene geometry and inaccurate camera parameter estimation.

Method: Proposes DDR for accurate rendering weight distribution and introduces constraints for correct geometry. Also integrates camera parameter learning during training.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scenes with small camera motion.

Conclusion: The proposed DDR and camera parameter learning effectively address challenges in dynamic scene synthesis with limited camera motion.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

*Jiale Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method tailored for multi-label images, using block-wise augmentation and image-aware contrastive loss to improve representation learning with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream SSL methods rely on single-label datasets like ImageNet, ignoring multi-label images' richer semantics and broader applicability. This work addresses the pre-training overhead and underutilization of multi-label data.

Method: Introduces a block-wise augmentation module to extract potential positive view pairs from multi-label images and an image-aware contrastive loss to connect these views for semantically consistent representations.

Result: Validated through linear fine-tuning and transfer learning, the method shows competitiveness despite limited sample quality and quantity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages multi-label images for SSL, reducing pre-training overhead while maintaining strong representation learning capabilities.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

*Hanyu Zhou,Haonan Wang,Haoyue Liu,Yuxing Duan,Luxin Yan,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using event cameras and Gaussian splatting disentangles spatiotemporal features for high-dynamic scene reconstruction, improving discrimination between static background and dynamic objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with spatiotemporal mismatches due to frame imaging limitations, failing to handle discontinuous temporal features and heterogeneous spatial features.

Method: Combines event cameras with frame cameras, using spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting and clustering to distinguish features.

Result: Improved spatiotemporal discrimination and time-continuous dynamic scene rendering, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses spatiotemporal mismatches, enhancing high-dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban research methods lack a unified framework for multi-modal data, which MLLMs could address.

Method: UrbanLLaVA uses a curated urban instruction dataset and a multi-stage training framework to enhance spatial reasoning and domain knowledge.

Result: UrbanLLaVA outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in urban tasks and shows robust generalization across cities.

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA provides a comprehensive solution for urban multi-modal data processing, with open-source availability for further research.

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel face forgery detection framework, Trident, uses triplet learning and adversarial training to improve adaptability and robustness against diverse forgery methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of deepfake technologies necessitates advanced detection methods to maintain digital media integrity and combat disinformation.

Method: Trident employs triplet learning with a Siamese network, domain-adversarial training, and controlled gradient flow to isolate forgery features and avoid overfitting.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness across benchmarks, showing improved robustness to unseen manipulations.

Conclusion: Trident offers a promising solution for detecting diverse face forgeries, with code to be released for broader use.

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

TL;DR: DEL is a framework for dense semantic action localization in videos, using multimodal interaction modeling to improve accuracy in detecting and classifying overlapping actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos have complex temporal dependencies and overlapping events, making action localization challenging.

Method: DEL aligns audio and visual features using masked self-attention and refines multimodal interactions across scales.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple TAL datasets with notable mAP gains.

Conclusion: DEL effectively addresses the challenges of dense action localization in untrimmed videos.

Abstract: Real-world videos often contain overlapping events and complex temporal
dependencies, making multimodal interaction modeling particularly challenging.
We introduce DEL, a framework for dense semantic action localization, aiming to
accurately detect and classify multiple actions at fine-grained temporal
resolutions in long untrimmed videos. DEL consists of two key modules: the
alignment of audio and visual features that leverage masked self-attention to
enhance intra-mode consistency and a multimodal interaction refinement module
that models cross-modal dependencies across multiple scales, enabling
high-level semantics and fine-grained details. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world Temporal Action
Localization (TAL) datasets, UnAV-100, THUMOS14, ActivityNet 1.3, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAMW, a method combining high-frequency augmentation and multi-wave mixing to improve transformer-based person search by addressing feature suppression and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models in person search face challenges like high-frequency feature suppression and high computational costs, limiting performance.

Method: HAMW uses a three-stage framework with high-frequency augmentation and replaces self-attention with multi-level Haar wavelet fusion for multi-scale feature capture.

Result: HAMW achieves state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Conclusion: HAMW effectively enhances feature extraction and efficiency in person search, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

*Dequan Kong,Zhe Zhu,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BridgeShape introduces a latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge framework for 3D shape completion, addressing suboptimal transport paths and resolution constraints by leveraging optimal transport and a Depth-Enhanced VQ-VAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to model optimal global transport paths and are limited by voxel-space resolution constraints, leading to suboptimal completions.

Method: BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport problem and uses a Depth-Enhanced VQ-VAE to encode shapes into a compact latent space, enhancing geometric perception.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling high-fidelity completions at higher resolutions and for unseen classes.

Conclusion: BridgeShape effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering superior fidelity and scalability in 3D shape completion.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-only SLAM systems relying on photometric loss struggle with robustness in unbounded outdoor environments due to viewpoint and illumination changes.

Method: TVG-SLAM introduces tri-view geometry, hybrid geometric constraints, probabilistic Gaussian initialization, and dynamic rendering trust attenuation.

Result: Outperforms prior systems, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error by 69.0% in challenging datasets while maintaining high rendering quality.

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM offers a robust solution for RGB-only SLAM in dynamic outdoor environments, with plans for open-source release.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely and accurate appendicitis diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications, but CT scan analysis can overwhelm radiologists.

Method: Proposes a deep learning model with 3D CT scans, Slice Attention, and hierarchical classification using pre-trained 2D models.

Result: Improves AUC by 3% for appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis.

Conclusion: The model offers a more efficient and reliable diagnostic solution for appendicitis.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification,
incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for
appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis, offering a more efficient
and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for high-quality pseudo-label generation in indoor point cloud semantic segmentation using scene-level annotations, leveraging multi-modal information and region-point semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with accurate pseudo-label generation from scene-level annotations, impacting segmentation performance. The paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: The framework includes a cross-modal feature guidance module for 2D-3D alignment and a region-point semantic consistency module for refining point-level predictions.

Result: Significant improvements on ScanNet v2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances pseudo-label quality and segmentation accuracy under scene-level annotation, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

TL;DR: VolumetricSMPL introduces a neural volumetric body model using Neural Blend Weights (NBW) for efficient and accurate human body modeling, outperforming prior methods in speed, memory, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surface mesh models struggle with interactions involving other geometric entities, while existing volumetric models are either inefficient or lack robustness for complex articulations.

Method: VolumetricSMPL employs NBW to dynamically blend learned weight matrices, reducing computational costs while maintaining expressiveness. It also uses a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for differentiable contact modeling.

Result: The model achieves 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, and improved accuracy compared to COAP. It excels in tasks like human-object interaction reconstruction and motion synthesis.

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL offers a robust, efficient solution for volumetric human body modeling, with broad applicability in graphics and vision tasks.

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

### [103] [Aggregating Local Saliency Maps for Semi-Global Explainable Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23247)
*James Hinns,David Martens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Segment Attribution Tables (SATs) summarize local saliency explanations into semi-global insights, bridging the gap between oversimplified global summaries and overly detailed local explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models lack transparency in how they make predictions, with existing methods either too local (saliency maps) or too global (oversimplified summaries).

Method: SATs use image segments (e.g., "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and saliency maps to quantify segment influence, revealing recurring patterns and spurious correlations.

Result: SATs provide insights into model behavior, identifying reliance on specific segments (e.g., backgrounds or watermarks) even when performance metrics don't reflect issues.

Conclusion: SATs offer a practical tool for analyzing and debugging image classifiers by balancing local and global explanation needs.

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGE-YOLO is an enhanced YOLO-based framework for multi-modal UAV object detection, featuring dual-branch architecture, EMA mechanism, and a Gather-and-Distribute module, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting small objects in complex aerial scenarios with multi-modal inputs, where existing methods trade performance for speed.

Method: Introduces a dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism, and a Gather-and-Distribute module to replace the conventional neck.

Result: Achieves superior performance on the Drone Vehicle dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DGE-YOLO effectively addresses multi-modal UAV object detection challenges, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

TL;DR: PixelBoost is a diffusion model for image super-resolution that leverages controlled stochasticity to enhance realism and computational efficiency, outperforming metrics like LPIPS, LOE, PSNR, and SSIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency in diffusion-model-based super-resolution, particularly when reducing sampling steps leads to hazy images.

Method: Introduces PixelBoost, a diffusion model incorporating controlled stochasticity inspired by Brownian motion, with a sigmoidal noise sequencing method for simplified training and faster inference.

Result: Superior performance in LPIPS, LOE, PSNR, SSIM, and visual quality, with enhanced edge reconstruction and adaptive learning to noise patterns.

Conclusion: PixelBoost effectively balances realism and efficiency in image super-resolution by embracing stochasticity, achieving high-quality results with faster inference.

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

TL;DR: A multimodal video summarization framework integrates text, audio, and visual cues to generate behavior-aware summaries, outperforming traditional methods in metrics like ROUGE-1 and F1-Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective summarization techniques for growing video content in educational, professional, and social domains, beyond unimodal approaches.

Method: A behavior-aware framework combining prosodic features, textual cues, and visual indicators to identify important moments, including bonus words emphasized across modalities.

Result: Significant improvements over traditional methods: ROUGE-1 (0.4769 to 0.7929), BERTScore (0.9152 to 0.9536), and F1-Score (23% increase).

Conclusion: Multimodal integration enhances the relevance and clarity of video summaries, demonstrating its potential for comprehensive behavior-aware summarization.

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

*Chongke Bi,Xin Gao,Baofeng Fu,Yuheng Zhao,Siming Chen,Ying Zhao,Yunhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCLVis is a framework for analyzing process communication latency (PCL) events using MPI data, aiding users in optimizing large-scale simulations without needing physical link layer information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale simulations face scalability issues due to high communication costs, but existing methods require inaccessible physical link layer data. PCLVis addresses this gap.

Method: PCLVis uses MPI process communication data, clustering correlated processes, analyzing propagation paths via a DAG, and visualizing communication states with CS-Glyphs.

Result: The framework effectively analyzes PCL events on the TH-1A supercomputer, helping users optimize simulations.

Conclusion: PCLVis improves simulation efficiency by enabling general users to analyze and optimize communication latency without administrative data.

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

TL;DR: Causal-VidSyn, a diffusion model, synthesizes egocentric traffic accident videos by leveraging cause descriptions and driver fixations, outperforming state-of-the-art models in quality and causal sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and simulating car accidents is vital for self-driving car safety, but incorporating real-world causal relations into synthetic videos is challenging.

Method: Proposes Causal-VidSyn, using cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify accident participants and behaviors, supported by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules.

Result: Causal-VidSyn excels in frame quality and causal sensitivity for tasks like accident video editing and text-to-video generation.

Conclusion: The model and dataset Drive-Gaze advance synthetic accident video generation, enhancing self-driving car safety testing.

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

### [109] [Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23270)
*Yi Li,Hualiang Wang,Xinpeng Ding,Haonan Wang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token Activation Map (TAM), a method to improve the explainability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by addressing redundant activations in token sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The explainability of MLLMs is underexplored, and redundant activations in token sequences hinder reliable explanations.

Method: Proposes an estimated causal inference method and a rank Gaussian filter to mitigate interference and reduce activation noises, termed Token Activation Map (TAM).

Result: TAM outperforms existing methods, providing high-quality visualizations for tasks like object localization, failure analysis, and model understanding.

Conclusion: TAM enhances MLLM explainability by addressing token interactions, offering versatile applications in visualization and model analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Motivation: To advance embodied intelligence by integrating structured memory systems with foundation models for lifelong learning and social interactions.

Method: Ella uses a name-centric semantic memory and spatiotemporal episodic memory, combined with foundation models, to store, update, and retrieve information for decision-making and social activities.

Result: Ella successfully influences, leads, and cooperates with other agents in a dynamic 3D world, demonstrating effective learning through observation and interaction.

Conclusion: The integration of structured memory systems with foundation models holds transformative potential for advancing embodied intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and
acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.
At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

TL;DR: Mettle is a memory-efficient method for adapting pretrained transformers to audio-visual tasks using Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD) and Meta-Token Injection (MTI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently adapt large-scale pretrained transformers for downstream audio-visual tasks while preserving pretrained knowledge and enabling task-specific adaptation.

Method: Uses LCD to distill audio/visual features into compact meta-tokens in parallel and MTI to guide feature adaptation in earlier layers for fine-grained tasks.

Result: Significantly reduces memory usage and training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Mettle is effective for audio-visual tasks, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, a novel problem for creating coherent image sets with diverse consistency requirements. It proposes T2IS-Bench, T2IS-Eval, and AutoT2IS to address the challenge, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for consistent image generation are domain-specific and lack generalizability. The paper aims to tackle the broader problem of generating image sets with varied consistency needs based on user instructions.

Method: The authors introduce T2IS-Bench (a dataset with diverse instructions), T2IS-Eval (an evaluation framework), and AutoT2IS (a training-free framework leveraging pretrained Diffusion Transformers).

Result: AutoT2IS outperforms existing methods on T2IS-Bench, addressing diverse consistency challenges and enabling real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances Text-to-ImageSet generation, offering practical value and outperforming specialized approaches.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionGPT3 is a bimodal motion-language model addressing challenges in unified motion-language understanding and generation by decoupling motion modeling and preserving language intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between continuous motion and discrete language representation and prevent degradation of language intelligence in unified training.

Method: Uses separate model parameters for motion and language, integrates a motion branch via shared attention, and employs a motion VAE with a diffusion head for motion prediction.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in motion understanding and generation while maintaining strong language capabilities.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified bimodal motion diffusion framework within an autoregressive manner.

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in likelihood-based video anomaly detection (VAD) by tackling gaps in scene, motion, and appearance. It introduces a noise-conditioned score transformer and a novel autoregressive denoising mechanism to enhance anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Likelihood-based VAD methods struggle with anomalies near learned distributions. The paper aims to address this by focusing on scene, motion, and appearance gaps.

Method: Proposes a noise-conditioned score transformer, a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function, and an autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three VAD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses gaps in VAD, improving anomaly detection by integrating scene, motion, and appearance considerations.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods adapt IFMs for video but often separate spatial and temporal information, missing the full complexity of video dynamics.

Method: Proposes SeqMod operation and Divide-and-Modulate architecture to inject spatial-temporal information into IFMs without disrupting original features.

Result: Achieves superior performance on multiple video benchmarks with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: MoMa effectively enhances video understanding by combining spatial-temporal modeling with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel competitive distillation strategy is proposed to enhance DNN training by allowing networks to dynamically act as teachers based on performance, improving learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation methods like mutual learning and self-distillation have limited improvements due to unclear learning directions across iterations.

Method: Competitive distillation organizes networks to compete and dynamically assign teacher roles, with stochastic perturbation to encourage better representations.

Result: The method shows promising performance across various tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Competitive distillation effectively enhances training by leveraging dynamic teacher roles and competition among networks.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

### [118] [DiffFit: Disentangled Garment Warping and Texture Refinement for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23295)
*Xiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffFit is a two-stage latent diffusion framework for virtual try-on, addressing garment detail preservation, alignment, efficiency, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON methods struggle with garment detail preservation, precise alignment, efficiency, and generalization to diverse poses/styles.

Method: DiffFit uses a two-stage approach: geometry-aware garment warping followed by texture refinement via cross-modal conditional diffusion.

Result: DiffFit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving garment details and alignment, validated by benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiffFit enhances VTON realism and stability by decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

### [119] [Endo-4DGX: Robust Endoscopic Scene Reconstruction and Illumination Correction with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23308)
*Yiming Huang,Long Bai,Beilei Cui,Yanheng Li,Tong Chen,Jie Wang,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Lei,Hongbin Liu,Hongliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endo-4DGX is a novel method for reconstructing soft tissue in endoscopic scenes with uneven lighting, addressing challenges in 3D-GS-based techniques under extreme light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate soft tissue reconstruction is vital for robotic surgery, but current 3D-GS methods fail under varying illumination (low light, over-exposure).

Method: Endo-4DGX uses illumination-adaptive Gaussian Splatting with illumination embeddings, region-aware enhancement, and spatial-aware adjustment modules, plus an exposure control loss.

Result: Endo-4DGX achieves superior rendering under extreme lighting while maintaining geometric accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Endo-4DGX advances robotic surgery by improving reconstruction quality in challenging lighting, with code available for further use.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lastbasket/Endo-4DGX.

### [120] [FastSeg: Efficient Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323)
*Quang-Huy Che,Vinh-Tiep Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastSeg is a training-free framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, using a pretrained diffusion model with minimal steps, achieving high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either lose spatial precision (contrastive learning) or struggle with iteration-quality balance (diffusion models). FastSeg aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses (1+1)-step reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model, dual-prompt mechanism, Hierarchical Attention Refinement (HARD), and Test-Time Flipping (TTF) for all-class segmentation.

Result: Achieves 43.8% average mIoU on PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: FastSeg balances segmentation quality and efficiency, offering a strong foundation for future extensions.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IR3D-Bench is a benchmark challenging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to demonstrate scene understanding by actively recreating 3D structures from images, using tools, and evaluated on geometric accuracy and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if VLMs truly understand scenes beyond passive recognition by testing their ability to actively create and reconstruct scenes.

Method: IR3D-Bench tasks VLMs with using programming and rendering tools to recreate 3D structures from input images, grounded in the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm.

Result: Initial experiments reveal limitations in visual precision, though basic tool usage is adequate.

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench provides a framework to advance tool-using VLAs towards genuine scene understanding through creation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight
current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool
usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to
facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine
scene understanding by creating.

### [122] [CycleVAR: Repurposing Autoregressive Model for Unsupervised One-Step Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23347)
*Yi Liu,Shengqian Li,Zuzeng Lin,Feng Wang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CycleVAR introduces Softmax Relaxed Quantization and reformulates image translation as autoregressive generation, outperforming state-of-the-art models like CycleGAN-Turbo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack gradient flow in unsupervised image translation due to discrete quantization, limiting end-to-end optimization.

Method: Proposes Softmax Relaxed Quantization for continuous gradient flow and CycleVAR, which uses multi-scale source image tokens for autoregressive generation in two modes: serial and parallel.

Result: Parallel one-step generation achieves better quality and speed than serial. CycleVAR outperforms previous models like CycleGAN-Turbo.

Conclusion: CycleVAR advances unsupervised image translation by addressing gradient flow issues and introducing efficient generation modes.

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

TL;DR: GeoProg3D is a visual programming framework for natural language-driven interactions with city-scale 3D scenes, combining geography-aware language fields and specialized vision APIs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D language approaches lack scalability and compositional reasoning for large urban settings, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: GeoProg3D integrates a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) with Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), using LLMs for dynamic task execution.

Result: GeoProg3D outperforms existing models on the GeoEval3D benchmark, excelling in grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement tasks.

Conclusion: GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling natural language-driven compositional reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments.

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

*Siyuan Chai,Xiaodong Guo,Tong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A task-oriented infrared image enhancement method improves contrast for autonomous driving by decomposing layers and extracting saliency information, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared images in autonomous driving suffer from low contrast, especially for non-heat-emitting targets, impacting high-level vision tasks. Enhancing contrast without noise amplification is challenging.

Method: Proposes layer decomposition to enhance details and preserve dark regions, followed by morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction to enhance targets without noise.

Result: Improves image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances infrared images for autonomous driving, addressing contrast and noise challenges while improving downstream task performance.

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoCus-Factory for multi-subject video customization data construction and OmniVCus, a diffusion Transformer framework with Lottery and Temporally Aligned Embeddings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single-subject scenarios and lack exploration of control signals like depth, mask, and text prompts for video customization.

Method: Proposes VideoCus-Factory for data construction and IVTM training for instructive editing. Introduces OmniVCus with Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned Embedding (TAE) for multi-subject inference and control signal alignment.

Result: OmniVCus surpasses state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The method advances multi-subject video customization and control signal utilization, with code and demos publicly available.

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

*Vikram Rangarajan,Shishira Maiya,Max Ehrlich,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIEDD accelerates INR video encoding by 20-30X without sacrificing quality or control, using a shared encoder and discrete decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow encoding times of INRs hinder adoption, and existing acceleration methods compromise quality or control.

Method: SIEDD uses a shared encoder for global features and lightweight decoders for frame groups, with aggressive sampling.

Result: Achieves 20-30X speed-up on HD/4K benchmarks while maintaining quality and compression ratios.

Conclusion: SIEDD advances neural video compression practicality, enabling real-world deployment.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in evaluating smartphone HR apps due to device variability and lack of standardized testing methods.

Method: A system with a test rig for 12 smartphones, synthetic PPG test videos, and a host machine for coordination.

Result: Achieved 0.11% MAPE in HR measurement and 0.92 correlation coefficient, with all tested devices meeting ANSI/CTA standards.

Conclusion: The platform provides a scalable solution for improving app performance and device compatibility in mobile health.

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile
health.

*Parham Rezaei,Arash Marioriyad,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses spatial misalignment in text-to-image models by introducing a probabilistic framework (PoS) and two contributions: PSE for evaluation and PSG for generation, improving spatial accuracy without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with accurately representing spatial relationships in prompts, leading to misaligned compositions.

Method: Proposes PoS-based Evaluation (PSE) for assessing spatial alignment and PoS-based Generation (PSG) for improving it via gradient-based guidance or search-based noise selection.

Result: PSE aligns better with human judgment than traditional metrics, and PSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating spatially accurate images.

Conclusion: The PoS framework and its applications (PSE and PSG) effectively address spatial misalignment in text-to-image models, enhancing compositional generation.

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

*Menna Taha,Aya Ahmed,Mohammed Karmoose,Yasser Gadallah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel object detection approach for AVs focusing on harmfulness rather than class-based classification to improve safety with OOD objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional object detection fails with OOD objects, posing safety risks for AVs.

Method: Classifies objects as 'harmful' or 'harmless' based on position and trajectory relative to the AV.

Result: Effectively detects OOD objects and evaluates harmfulness, improving AV decision-making.

Conclusion: The approach enhances AV safety by addressing OOD object detection and harmfulness classification.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

*Tianran Liu,Shengwen Zhao,Nicholas Rhinehart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on improving LiDAR world models' transferability across domains, achieving significant performance gains and efficiency improvements with a novel latent conditional flow matching framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR world models lack transferability across domains, requiring domain-specific training. The study aims to develop models that generalize better and reduce reliance on annotated data.

Method: Conducted domain transfer studies across three scenarios, proposed a latent conditional flow matching (CFM)-based framework for efficient training and compression.

Result: Achieved up to 11% absolute improvement (83% relative) over training from scratch, outperforming in 30/36 comparisons. Reduced labeled data needs by 95% and improved computational efficiency (23x).

Conclusion: The proposed CFM-based framework enhances transferability, efficiency, and performance of LiDAR world models, setting new benchmarks in semantic occupancy forecasting.

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

TL;DR: PathDiff is a diffusion framework that generates histopathology images by integrating unpaired mask-text data, improving control over semantics and spatial details for better image quality and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets lack paired text and mask data for histopathology images, limiting joint use in image generation and control over semantics and spatial details.

Method: Proposes PathDiff, a diffusion framework that learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities into a unified conditioning space.

Result: PathDiff generates high-quality, semantically accurate images, improving fidelity, text-image alignment, and faithfulness for tasks like nuclei segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: PathDiff outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging unpaired data for enhanced histopathology image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

### [132] [Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460)
*Dewen Zeng,Xinrong Hu,Yu-Jen Chen,Yawen Wu,Xiaowei Xu,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLDF, a contrastive learning method using diffusion features to improve weakly supervised semantic segmentation by addressing noise in saliency maps from CDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAM-based WSSS methods suffer from partial activations and imprecise boundaries, while CDM-based methods introduce noise in saliency maps.

Method: CLDF combines contrastive learning with diffusion features, integrating gradient maps from CDM and CAMs to refine foreground/background identification.

Result: CLDF outperforms baselines on four segmentation tasks across two medical datasets.

Conclusion: CLDF effectively mitigates noise in CDM-generated saliency maps, enhancing segmentation performance in WSSS.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time-vAriant iMage inPainting (TAMP), a novel task restoring damaged images using time-variant reference images. It proposes InDiTE-Diff, integrating an Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation module with diffusion models, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of restoring damaged images using time-variant reference images, which often differ significantly and may also be damaged, a common real-world problem.

Method: Proposes InDiTE-Diff, combining an Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module with diffusion models for adaptive semantics and latent cross-reference during sampling.

Result: Experiments on the TAMP-Street dataset show InDiTE-Diff consistently outperforms SOTA reference-guided inpainting methods in TAMP tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed InDiTE-Diff effectively solves the TAMP problem, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

*Nazanin Mahjourian,Vinh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLSR is a vision-language framework for sanitizing and refining noisy labels in manufacturing datasets, improving label quality with minimal human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale datasets, especially in manufacturing, often have noisy labels due to crowd-sourcing or web-scraping, making high-quality labels costly and rare.

Method: Uses CLIP to embed images and labels into a shared semantic space, performs label sanitization via cosine similarity, and clusters labels for refinement.

Result: VLSR effectively identifies and fixes problematic labels, reducing vocabulary size and improving dataset quality for industrial ML models.

Conclusion: VLSR enhances label consistency and dataset quality, enabling robust ML training in industrial applications with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities

comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCD, a topology-aware geodesic distance metric, outperforms Chamfer Distance (CD) in 3D point cloud learning by better capturing intrinsic geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CD's reliance on Euclidean distances fails to capture intrinsic geometry, limiting its effectiveness in 3D point cloud learning.

Method: Proposed GeoCD, a differentiable geodesic distance approximation, and fine-tuned models trained with CD using GeoCD.

Result: GeoCD improves reconstruction quality significantly, even with just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GeoCD is a superior metric for 3D point cloud learning, enhancing performance over CD.

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high GPU resource demand and slow training of Implicit Neural Representation (INR) and the limitations of GaussianImage, such as fixed Gaussian numbers per image.

Method: Uses a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning, and dynamically adjusts Gaussian points based on image complexity.

Result: Achieves comparable or better rendering quality than GaussianImage with significantly reduced training time (up to 10x faster) and adapts to varying image complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical, efficient, and flexible solution for image representation, outperforming existing methods in training speed and adaptability.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the

techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and

Result: MTADiffusion outperforms other methods on BrushBench and EditBench, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MTADiffusion effectively addresses key challenges in image inpainting, offering improved semantic alignment, structural stability, and style consistency.

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-enhanced action-aware multi-modal prompt-tuning method to improve CLIP's fine-grained action-level understanding, addressing its limitations in object attributes and spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP lacks fine-grained understanding of actions, which are crucial for describing object states or relationships. The goal is to enhance CLIP with action-level comprehension using LLM-generated knowledge.

Method: The authors propose an action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to leverage LLM knowledge. They also introduce an adaptive interaction module to aggregate visual features for action-aware representations.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness on two benchmark datasets, improving performance in fine-grained action understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances CLIP's action-level understanding, leveraging LLMs for better visual-language alignment.

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with the modality gap between panoramic and perspective data, limiting the quality of synthesized panoramic videos.

Method: Introduces ViewPoint map for global spatial continuity and fine-grained details, and a Pano-Perspective attention mechanism to utilize pretrained perspective priors.

Result: The method synthesizes highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos, outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between panoramic and perspective data, advancing panoramic video generation.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

*Qi Qin,Runmin Cong,Gen Zhan,Yiting Liao,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces fixation information to improve video salient object detection (VSOD) under weak supervision, proposing modules for better feature learning and spatiotemporal modeling, achieving superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye-tracking annotations are more accessible and align with human visual patterns, making them useful for weakly supervised VSOD.

Method: Proposes a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module for feature guidance and a Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor for spatiotemporal modeling. Also introduces an Intra-Inter Mixed Contrastive (IIMC) model for improved learning.

Result: Outperforms competitors on five VSOD benchmarks across various metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages fixation information and weak supervision to enhance VSOD performance.

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight temporal transformer decomposition method to enhance autonomous driving by efficiently processing sequential image frames and steering data, outperforming existing approaches in real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems struggle with complex environments using single-image inputs, and existing high-performance methods are resource-intensive and impractical for federated learning.

Method: The method involves breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices to process sequential image frames and temporal steering data, reducing model complexity.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show the method outperforms recent approaches and achieves real-time performance, confirmed by real robot experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight temporal transformer decomposition effectively enhances autonomous driving performance while maintaining efficiency and practicality.

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: The paper explores test-time adaptation (TTA) for self-supervised learning (SSL) models, proposing a collaborative framework to improve performance without relying on source pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of TTA methods struggling with low-accuracy SSL models and reduce dependency on source pretraining.

Method: Introduces a self-supervised TTA protocol and a collaborative learning framework combining SSL and TTA, using contrastive learning and knowledge distillation.

Result: Validated on SSL models (DINO, MoCo, iBOT) across TTA benchmarks, achieving competitive performance without source pretraining.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances SSL models via TTA, demonstrating practical applicability without reliance on source pretraining.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

TL;DR: GVIT replaces pixel/patch grids with learnable 2D Gaussians for image classification, achieving competitive performance with ViT-B on Imagenet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative input representations beyond traditional pixel or patch grids for vision tasks.

Method: Encodes images as optimized 2D Gaussians, jointly trained with a ViT classifier using gradients for guidance and a differentiable renderer for reconstruction.

Result: GVIT achieves 76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k, matching patch-based ViT performance.

Conclusion: GVIT demonstrates the viability of Gaussian-based representations for vision tasks, offering a compact and efficient alternative to grids.

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

*Yuhao Huang,Yueyue Xu,Haoran Dou,Jiaxiao Deng,Xin Yang,Hongyu Zheng,Dong Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An intelligent system using 3D ultrasound for automated plane localization and congenital uterine anomaly (CUA) diagnosis, incorporating denoising diffusion models, reinforcement learning, and text-driven uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUAs cause infertility and pregnancy complications; 3D ultrasound improves accuracy over 2D, but automated diagnosis is needed.

Method: Combines denoising diffusion models with local/global guidance, reinforcement learning for key slice extraction, and text-driven uncertainty modeling.

Result: Effective plane localization and CUA diagnosis demonstrated on a large 3D uterine ultrasound dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances accuracy and efficiency in diagnosing CUAs using advanced AI techniques.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

### [152] [Consistent Time-of-Flight Depth Denoising via Graph-Informed Geometric Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23542)
*Weida Wang,Changyong He,Jin Zeng,Di Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel ToF depth denoising network using motion-invariant graph fusion improves temporal stability and spatial sharpness by leveraging cross-frame geometric attention and a maximum a posteriori formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth images from ToF sensors are noisy, and existing methods either ignore multi-frame depth variations or lack temporal consistency, leading to poor performance.

Method: The proposed method uses motion-invariant graph fusion for cross-frame geometric attention, incorporates an image smoothness prior and ToF noise distribution, and unrolls the solution into iterative filters.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic DVToF and real Kinectv2 datasets, with improved accuracy and consistency.

Conclusion: The approach provides a high-performance, interpretable network for ToF depth denoising, with robust generalization and plans for open-source release.

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

*Hui Li,Baoyou Chen,Liwei Zhang,Jiaye Li,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPFlow improves DiTs by varying patch sizes across timesteps, enhancing speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize computation cost and improve efficiency in diffusion transformers by adapting patch sizes dynamically.

Method: Introduces Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow) with varying patch sizes for different noise levels, modified linear projections, and adjusted Unpatchify.

Result: Achieves 1.6×-2.0× faster inference with similar performance and lower training FLOPs; pretrained DiTs show even better results.

Conclusion: PPFlow effectively balances speed and performance in diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Oneta is a novel algorithm for multi-style image enhancement using a two-step model (intensity enhancement and color correction) with compact representation and style-specific tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a versatile and high-performing solution for multi-style image enhancement tasks.

Method: Uses Y-Net and C-Net to predict parameters for eigentransformation function (eigenTF) and color correction matrix (CCM), respectively, with K learnable style tokens.

Result: Achieves high performance across six enhancement tasks (retouching, ISP, low-light, dehazing, underwater, white balancing) on 30 datasets.

Conclusion: Oneta is effective and versatile for multi-style image enhancement, demonstrating strong performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the overlooked link between facial motion and speech in generative modeling by unifying talking head synthesis and text-to-speech tasks.

Method: Leverages flow matching and MM-DiT with Motion-DiT and Audio-DiT modules, using selective joint attention and temporally aligned embeddings for cross-modal interaction.

Result: Enables tasks like synchronized talking head generation from text and audio-driven animation within a single model.

Conclusion: JAM-Flow advances multi-modal generative modeling by offering a practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis.

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.

### [156] [LH2Face: Loss function for Hard High-quality Face](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23555)
*Fan Xie,Pan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LH2Face, a novel loss function for face recognition that addresses hard samples by using adaptive margins and proxy-based constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face recognition methods struggle with hard samples and lack adaptive strategies for face quality or recognition hardness, leading to uniform training.

Method: LH2Face combines a vMF-based similarity measure, an adaptive margin function, proxy-based constraints, and a face renderer for optimization.

Result: LH2Face achieves 49.39% accuracy on IJB-B, surpassing the second-best method by 2.37%.

Conclusion: LH2Face effectively improves face recognition performance on hard high-quality samples through adaptive and optimized strategies.

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Object-centric Radiance Fields (OcRF) to improve 3D object detection by focusing on foreground objects and avoiding background noise, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for multi-view 3D object detection rely on implicit, data-driven approaches, limiting performance. Radiance fields, successful in 3D reconstruction, are explored but degrade detection when used directly.

Method: Proposes OcRF to model foreground objects and discard background noise. Uses Height-aware Opacity-based Attention (HOA) to enhance 2D features.

Result: Achieves 57.2% mAP and 64.8% NDS on nuScenes test benchmark, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: OcRFDet effectively enhances 3D detection by leveraging radiance fields for foreground modeling and HOA for feature enhancement.

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

*Luigi Sigillo,Renato Giamba,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MWT-Diff is a framework for satellite image super-resolution using latent diffusion models and wavelet transforms, outperforming recent methods in perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution satellite imagery is limited by sensor constraints and costs, hindering applications like environmental monitoring and disaster response.

Method: Combines latent diffusion models with wavelet transforms, using a metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder) to guide hierarchical diffusion dynamics.

Result: MWT-Diff outperforms recent approaches in perceptual quality metrics (FID, LPIPS) while preserving spatial characteristics.

Conclusion: MWT-Diff effectively addresses challenges in satellite image super-resolution, offering improved performance for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EV-UAV, a large-scale event-based dataset for small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV tasks, and proposes EV-SpSegNet, a novel baseline method with a Spatiotemporal Correlation loss for improved detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras struggle with SOD due to low frame rates and data redundancy, while existing event-based datasets lack diversity and small targets.

Method: Proposes EV-SpSegNet, a sparse segmentation network for event point clouds, and a Spatiotemporal Correlation loss to leverage motion continuity.

Result: EV-UAV dataset includes 147 sequences with 2.3M annotations, and EV-SpSegNet outperforms benchmarks on this dataset.

Conclusion: The EV-UAV dataset and EV-SpSegNet provide a robust benchmark and method for future SOD research in anti-UAV tasks.

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

TL;DR: The paper proposes StackCLIP, a method using stacked prompts to enhance text-image alignment in CLIP for zero-shot industrial anomaly detection, improving generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing overfitting and limited generalization in CLIP due to specific category prompts during pretraining.

Method: Introduces Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) and Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) modules, along with Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) for refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: StackCLIP significantly improves zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation, offering robust generalization.

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-language method for dataset distillation, enhancing performance by integrating text prototypes derived from an open-source large language model, improving logical coherence and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on images, often ignoring semantic context, leading to poor generalization and illogical outputs. This study aims to address this by incorporating language information.

Method: The approach integrates text prototypes (from an open-source LLM) with image prototypes to collaboratively synthesize data, enhancing distillation performance.

Result: The method produces logically coherent images with target objects, achieving state-of-the-art validation performance and robust generalization.

Conclusion: The framework expands dataset distillation beyond image-based approaches, demonstrating broad applicability and improved performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and

TL;DR: PBCAT, a Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training method, improves object detector robustness against various physically realizable attacks, outperforming existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detectors are vulnerable to physically realizable attacks (e.g., adversarial patches, textures), but existing defenses focus narrowly on patches, leaving broader threats unaddressed.

Method: PBCAT combines small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global perturbations to train models, enhancing defense against diverse attacks.

Result: PBCAT boosts detection accuracy by 29.7% under adversarial texture attacks and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness.

Conclusion: PBCAT offers a unified and effective defense against a wide range of physically realizable attacks, significantly improving object detector security.

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

### [163] [CAI: Caption-Sensitive Attention Intervention for Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23590)
*Qiming Li,Zekai Ye,Xiaocheng Feng,Weihong Zhong,Libo Qin,Ruihan Chen,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yaowei Wang,Ting Liu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a training-free method to reduce object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by leveraging attention patterns from caption queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce inaccurate visual interpretations (object hallucination), and existing solutions are costly or slow. The paper aims to address this efficiently.

Method: Proposes CAI, which uses attention activation patterns from caption queries to enhance LVLMs' visual perception without additional training.

Result: CAI achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination mitigation across four benchmarks with minimal inference cost.

Conclusion: CAI is an effective, low-cost solution for reducing object hallucination in LVLMs.

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynLecSlideGen, a pipeline for generating synthetic lecture slides using LLMs, and evaluates its effectiveness through few-shot transfer learning on real data, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of lecture slides for training models is labor-intensive and requires expertise, prompting the need for synthetic data generation.

Method: Proposes SynLecSlideGen, an LLM-guided pipeline for synthetic slide generation, and evaluates it using a manually annotated benchmark (RealSlide) and few-shot transfer learning.

Result: Few-shot transfer learning with synthetic slides significantly outperforms training only on real data, proving synthetic data's utility.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled lecture slides, as demonstrated by improved model performance.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on
our project website: https://synslidegen.github.io/.

*Zhengkang Xiang,Zizhao Li,Amir Khodabandeh,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SG-LDM is a Semantic-Guided Lidar Diffusion Model for high-fidelity lidar point cloud synthesis, outperforming existing methods and enhancing downstream tasks like segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of diversity in real-world lidar data and the limitations of unconditional generation methods by enabling semantic-guided synthesis.

Method: SG-LDM uses latent alignment and explicit semantic conditioning to generate lidar point clouds, and introduces a diffusion-based lidar translation framework for domain adaptation.

Result: SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in lidar synthesis and improves downstream segmentation tasks through data augmentation.

Conclusion: SG-LDM advances lidar point cloud synthesis and translation, offering practical benefits for real-world applications and downstream perception tasks.

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

*Shiqi Zhang,Sha Zhang,Jiajun Deng,Yedong Shen,Mingxiao MA,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGOV3D introduces a two-stage training strategy for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, leveraging partial scenes and multi-modal models to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook rich semantic content and cross-view correspondences in multi-view images, limiting effectiveness.

Method: A two-stage approach: pre-training on partial scenes with dense semantics and fine-tuning on complete scenes, using MLLM and 2D segmentation for open-vocabulary labels.

Result: PGOV3D achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the semantic gap between partial and complete 3D scenes, enhancing open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

*Ziao Liu,Zhenjia Li,Yifeng Shi,Xiangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS eliminates dependency on high-quality point clouds for 3D Gaussian Splatting by using structural attention, improving reconstruction in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) relies on high-quality point clouds from SfM, which fails in texture-deficient or constrained-view cases, limiting its applicability.

Method: AttentionGS uses geometric attention early for global structure recovery and texture attention later for detail refinement, along with opacity-weighted gradients for Gaussian densification.

Result: AttentionGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in unreliable point cloud initialization scenarios.

Conclusion: AttentionGS enhances robustness and flexibility of 3D Gaussian Splatting for real-world applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

### [168] [TurboVSR: Fantastic Video Upscalers and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23618)
*Zhongdao Wang,Guodongfang Zhao,Jingjing Ren,Bailan Feng,Shifeng Zhang,Wenbo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboVSR is an ultra-efficient diffusion-based video super-resolution model that addresses computational inefficiency in current methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being 100+ times faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based VSR methods are computationally inefficient, taking too long to process videos, which limits practical applications.

Method: TurboVSR employs a high-compression autoencoder, factorized conditioning for training, and converts a pre-trained diffusion model into a shortcut model for faster inference.

Result: TurboVSR matches state-of-the-art performance, processes a 2-second 1080p video in 7 seconds, and supports 4K image super-resolution with fine details.

Conclusion: TurboVSR significantly improves computational efficiency without sacrificing quality, enabling practical high-resolution video and image super-resolution.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

*Shaofei Huang,Rui Ling,Tianrui Hui,Hongyu Li,Xu Zhou,Shifeng Zhang,Si Liu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), addressing limitations of audio-centric methods by using vision-derived queries and a Prototype Prompted Query Generation module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-centric Transformers in AVS suffer from perception ambiguity and weakened dense prediction due to visual detail loss.

Method: Proposes VCT with vision-derived queries and a PPQG module for semantically aware, visually rich queries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AVSBench dataset subsets.

Conclusion: VCT effectively addresses audio-centric limitations, improving segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using MobileNET for efficient brain tumor detection, addressing limitations of traditional methods and classical ML models, achieving 98.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumors are critical health risks, and current detection methods (biopsies, MRI, CT scans) are costly and require expertise. Classical ML/DL models face computational and data challenges.

Method: The research employs the MobileNET model for tumor detection, focusing on reduced computational resources and faster processing, combined with image processing for accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Conclusion: MobileNET offers an efficient, accurate solution for brain tumor detection, overcoming traditional and classical ML limitations.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models can blend diverse concepts into coherent images without training, using methods like prompt scheduling and embedding interpolation. No single method dominates; outcomes depend on input variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if diffusion models can blend distinct concepts (objects, ideas) into novel images under a zero-shot framework.

Method: Four blending techniques: prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, layer-wise conditioning, and others, tested across diverse concept categories.

Result: Models show creative blending capabilities; no single method is universally best. User study confirms sensitivity to input variations.

Conclusion: Diffusion models have strong compositional potential but are sensitive to minor input changes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

TL;DR: A framework for multimodal understanding using byte-pair encoding on visual tokens, improving cross-modal alignment and performance in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of aligning different modalities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by unifying visual and textual representations.

Method: Uses byte-pair encoding for visual tokens, priority-guided encoding (frequency and spatial consistency), and multi-stage training with curriculum-driven data.

Result: Improved performance in diverse vision-language tasks by better capturing cross-modal relationships.

Conclusion: The approach advances multimodal foundation models by bridging visual and textual representations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAP-Diffusion leverages MLLMs to generate detailed medical image descriptions, improving realism and diversity in image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detailed attribute descriptions for medical images are often unavailable, limiting generative models.

Method: Uses MLLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts to generate descriptions, and a Prototype Condition Mechanism for robustness.

Result: Effective across three medical imaging types and four datasets.

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion enhances medical image generation quality and diversity.

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intelligent methods for mitral regurgitation (MR) diagnosis often misalign with clinical workflows, leading to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability.

Method: MReg formulates MR diagnosis as a regression task, uses feature selection/amplification to mimic sonographer logic, and introduces a feature summary module for category-level feature extraction.

Result: MReg outperformed other methods on a dataset of 1868 cases with graded regurgitation labels.

Conclusion: MReg enhances MR diagnosis accuracy and interpretability, aligning better with clinical needs.

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance markerless tracking in spine surgery, demonstrating high translational potential.

Abstract: Consumer-grade RGB-D imaging for intraoperative orthopedic tissue tracking is
a promising method with high translational potential. Unlike bone-mounted

However, its use has been limited to cadaveric studies. This paper introduces
the first real-world clinical RGB-D dataset for spine surgery and develops

TL;DR: Deepbench is a framework for evaluating domain-specific robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) using LLM-generated corruptions, revealing variability in performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency and declining effectiveness of pretrained VLMs under specialized domain shifts.

Method: Deepbench uses an LLM to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions for domain-specific evaluation without labeled data.

Result: Substantial variability in robustness across six real-world domains was observed.

Conclusion: Targeted, domain-aware evaluation is essential, and Deepbench is released as open-source for further research.

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

*Dongyue Wu,Zilin Guo,Jialong Zuo,Nong Sang,Changxin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFB is a novel framework for lossless training acceleration by adaptively pruning less important samples based on shallow-layer features, reducing computational costs without extra overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of large training datasets and inefficiencies in existing data pruning methods.

Method: Uses Partial Forward Blocking (PFB) to assess sample importance via shallow-layer features, prune less important samples, and avoid deep-layer computations for pruned samples. Introduces probability density for dynamic importance prioritization.

Result: Achieves 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction on ImageNet with 40% data pruned.

Conclusion: PFB efficiently accelerates training while maintaining or improving model performance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

### [178] [Pruning by Block Benefit: Exploring the Properties of Vision Transformer Blocks during Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23675)
*Patrick Glandorf,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P3B is a pruning method for Vision Transformers that globally allocates resources by block contribution, maintaining performance even at high sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers are computationally expensive, and pruning on unseen domains leads to suboptimal resource allocation.

Method: P3B uses block-level contributions to assign resources, reactivates late-converging blocks, and sets layerwise keep ratios.

Result: P3B achieves state-of-the-art pruning, maintaining high performance even at 70% sparsity with minimal accuracy loss (0.64%).

Conclusion: P3B is effective for resource-efficient pruning, especially in transfer learning tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

*Gaozheng Pei,Ke Ma,Dongpeng Zhang,Chengzhi Sun,Qianqian Xu,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework integrates traditional transferability strategies into diffusion-based adversarial example generation, enhancing its applicability beyond image classification, validated by winning a competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based adversarial methods struggle with generalization and adapting traditional transferability strategies, limiting their use in tasks like Deepfake detection.

Method: Proposes a unified framework to incorporate traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation via image editing.

Result: The method won first place in a competition, demonstrating its effectiveness in broader downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between diffusion-based adversarial methods and traditional transferability strategies, expanding their utility.

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

### [180] [SynMotion: Semantic-Visual Adaptation for Motion Customized Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23690)
*Shuai Tan,Biao Gong,Yujie Wei,Shiwei Zhang,Zhuoxin Liu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Yan Wang,Hao Ouyang,Kecheng Zheng,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynMotion is a motion-customized video generation model that combines semantic guidance and visual adaptation to improve motion fidelity and semantic clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on semantic alignment or visual representation alone, leading to either overlooked motion complexity or semantic confusion.

Method: SynMotion uses dual-embedding semantic comprehension for subject-motion disentanglement and integrates motion adapters for visual fidelity. It employs an alternate optimization strategy for embeddings and introduces the SPV dataset.

Result: SynMotion outperforms baselines in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) settings, demonstrating improved motion specificity and generalization.

Conclusion: SynMotion effectively balances semantic and visual adaptation for high-quality motion-customized video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

*Smriti Joshi,Richard Osuala,Lidia Garrucho,Kaisar Kushibar,Dimitri Kessler,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A patch-based multi-view co-training method for single-image test-time adaptation in medical imaging, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 3.75% Dice score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the impracticality of large target domain datasets in medical settings and leveraging volumetric data richness.

Method: Patch-based multi-view co-training with uncertainty-guided self-training for feature and prediction consistency.

Result: Achieves performance close to supervised benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 3.75% Dice score.

Conclusion: The method enables effective volumetric segmentation with a single test-time image, validated on breast MRI datasets.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

*Haoyang Chen,Dongfang Sun,Caoyuan Ma,Shiqin Wang,Kewei Zhang,Zheng Wang,Zhixiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subjective Camera reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions using verbal descriptions and sketches, overcoming language and sketch limitations with a train-free, sequence-aware approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of language ambiguity, sketch abstraction, and modality gaps in existing methods for reconstructing scenes from subjective inputs.

Method: Uses concept-sequential generation with text-reward optimization, sequence-aware disentangled generation, and latent optimization to bridge sketch-3D gaps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic and spatial coherence across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively translates subjective perceptual expectations into photorealistic images without requiring model adaptation or high sketch precision.

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

*Chang'an Yi,Xiaohui Deng,Guohao Chen,Yan Zhou,Qinghua Lu,Shuaicheng Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCA introduces a Cross-Model Co-Learning framework for Test-time Adaptation (TTA), leveraging complementary knowledge across models to improve adaptation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods focus on single-model adaptation, ignoring the potential benefits of cross-model knowledge. This work explores how models of varying sizes can guide each other during TTA.

Method: COCA uses two strategies: 1) Co-adaptation integrates knowledge from other models to reduce biases, and 2) Self-adaptation enhances each model's strengths via unsupervised learning.

Result: COCA significantly improves adaptation accuracy, e.g., boosting ViT-Base's performance on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5% with MobileViT's guidance.

Conclusion: COCA demonstrates the value of cross-model co-learning in TTA, offering a plug-and-play solution that enhances existing methods across diverse model architectures.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proteus-ID is a diffusion-based framework for video identity customization, addressing identity consistency and motion coherence via multimodal fusion, dynamic identity injection, and adaptive motion learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task involves synthesizing realistic, coherent videos from a single image and text prompt, requiring solutions for identity consistency and natural motion.

Method: Proteus-ID uses Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF), Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII), and Adaptive Motion Learning (AML) to enhance identity preservation and motion realism.

Result: Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, validated on the Proteus-Bench dataset.

Conclusion: Proteus-ID sets a new benchmark for video identity customization, with publicly available codes and data.

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

*Annika Mütze,Sadia Ilyas,Christian Dörpelkus,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of open-vocabulary object detectors like Grounding DINO using synthetic data generated via Stable Diffusion, revealing overlooked objects and location-dependent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate model generalization and identify failure modes of open-vocabulary object detectors, which is crucial for safety-critical applications.

Method: Two automated pipelines using Stable Diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with diverse semantics, evaluated on synthetic data derived from LostAndFound and NuImages datasets.

Result: Synthetic data challenges detectors, showing overlooked objects and strong dependence on object location rather than semantics.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic way to test open-vocabulary models and insights for improving data acquisition to enhance model performance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Mamba-FETrack V2, an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework using Vision Mamba for lightweight, prompt-guided feature extraction and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high computational overhead and limited cross-modal interaction in existing multimodal tracking algorithms.

Method: Uses a Prompt Generator for dynamic prompt vectors and a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone for unified feature extraction and fusion.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and efficiency on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks like COESOT, FE108, and FELT V2.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective and efficient solution for RGB-Event object tracking, with plans to release code and models.

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

TL;DR: VisTex-OVLM enhances object detection in rare categories by projecting visual exemplars into text feature space, maintaining OVLM's architecture and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Object-level Vision-Language Models' (OVLMs) ability to detect rare categories that are hard to describe textually and lack pre-training data.

Method: Uses multi-scale textualizing blocks and multi-stage fusion to integrate visual information into textualized tokens, guiding OVLMs alongside text prompts.

Result: Superior performance on open-set datasets and state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO few-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM effectively enhances OVLMs for rare category detection without altering their architecture, achieving top performance.

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.

TL;DR: CRefDiff is a controllable reference-based diffusion model for super-resolution in remote sensing, addressing under-generation and over-reliance on reference images. It uses Stable Diffusion's generative prior, a dual-branch fusion mechanism, and a 'Better Start' strategy for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world complexities like cross-sensor resolution gaps and land cover changes, leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference images.

Method: CRefDiff leverages Stable Diffusion's generative prior, introduces a dual-branch fusion mechanism for adaptive reference integration, and employs 'Better Start' to reduce denoising steps.

Result: CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Real-RefRSSRD dataset and improves downstream tasks like scene classification and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: CRefDiff effectively addresses real-world RefSR challenges, offering superior performance, flexibility, and efficiency.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

*Carl Olsson,Amanda Nilsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for initialization-free BA using camera calibration to achieve near metric reconstructions, improving upon projective-invariant approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing initialization-free BA methods using pOSE lack camera calibration, leading to projective ambiguity and requiring more data. The goal is to incorporate calibration for better accuracy.

Method: The method integrates pairwise relative rotation estimates into the pOSE framework, leveraging camera calibration to encourage similarity-invariant solutions.

Result: The approach reliably converges to global minima from random starts, producing accurate near metric reconstructions.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines rotation averaging with pOSE, enabling initialization-free calibrated SfM with improved accuracy.

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

TL;DR: A novel few-shot anomaly detection method using CLIP for medical data, achieving superior performance in classification and segmentation without synthetic data or memory banks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of few-shot anomaly detection in medical data by leveraging pre-trained models and improving semantic alignment.

Method: Uses a dual-branch design with learnable adapters in CLIP for feature capture, learnable text prompts for alignment, and SigLIP loss for handling unpaired text prompts.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in both same-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations for anomaly classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, adaptable, and validated across multiple modalities, with each component contributing to its success.

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The

TL;DR: LaZSL is a locally-aligned vision-language model for interpretable zero-shot learning, using optimal transport to align visual regions with attributes, improving interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs like CLIP lack interpretability in zero-shot learning, as they compare entire images to category words without explaining predictions.

Method: LaZSL aligns local visual features with discrete attributes via optimal transport, enabling interpretable similarity without extra training.

Result: LaZSL enhances interpretability, improves accuracy, and shows strong domain generalization in experiments.

Conclusion: LaZSL addresses interpretability in VLMs by local alignment, offering a practical solution for zero-shot learning.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

Result: Achieves significant reductions in inference latency and state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench, and Video-MME.

Conclusion: Flash-VStream efficiently processes long videos, outperforming existing models in both performance and speed.

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

*Mingcheng Qu,Yuncong Wu,Donglin Di,Yue Gao,Tonghua Su,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NH2ST is a framework for predicting gene expression from pathology images by integrating spatial context and multi-modal data, outperforming existing methods by over 20% in PCC metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting gene expression from pathology images lack spatial and molecular interaction modeling, leading to poor performance.

Method: NH2ST uses a query-neighbor branch architecture with cross-attention and contrastive learning to capture spatial and cross-modal relationships.

Result: The model achieves over 20% improvement in PCC metrics across six datasets.

Conclusion: NH2ST effectively addresses the limitations of current methods by leveraging spatial context and multi-modal data for accurate gene expression prediction.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

*Ronit D. Gross,Tal Halevi,Ella Koresh,Yarden Tzach,Ido Kanter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores spontaneous symmetry breaking in multi-head attention (MHA) in transformers, generalizing it to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) for improved classification accuracy and reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and generalize the learning mechanism of MHA in transformers, particularly for classification tasks, and compare it with CNNs.

Method: Quantifies single-head performance (SHP) in LS-MHA, analogous to single-filter performance in CNNs, and replaces initial transformer blocks with convolutional layers.

Result: Improved classification accuracy due to higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced latency without accuracy loss. Distinct ViT architectures achieve similar accuracy with different LS-MHA structures.

Conclusion: The findings suggest potential extensions to NLP tasks and highlight the advantages of hybrid architectures combining CNNs and transformers.

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

*Oscar Ovanger,Ragnar Hauge,Jacob Skauvold,Michael J. Pyrcz,Jo Eidsvik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointSSIM is a resolution-invariant metric for comparing binary images by transforming them into marked point patterns and using a summary vector for robust analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of comparing binary images of varying resolutions while maintaining structural integrity.

Method: Transforms binary images into marked point patterns, extracts anchor points via locally adaptive maxima, and uses a summary vector for comparison.

Result: Efficient and reliable image comparison, especially for structural analysis across resolutions.

Conclusion: PointSSIM is a novel, effective solution for resolution-invariant binary image comparison.

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAISE is a 3D enhancement framework that refines object geometry and appearance in scenes with missing views, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of high-fidelity object-level modeling in scenes with missing viewpoints, critical for detailed object understanding.

Method: A two-stage refinement: substitutes degraded objects with proxies, aligns them in 7-DOF pose, and corrects inconsistencies via registration-constrained enhancement.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and geometry completion.

Conclusion: RAISE effectively recovers fine-grained object details while maintaining scene consistency, advancing object-level 3D modeling.

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) and its unique quality challenges, establishes the first RGC database (RGCD), and evaluates existing VQA models, revealing their limitations for RGC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on quality assessment for robotic-generated videos, which differ from PGC and UGC.

Method: Established the RGCD with 2,100 videos, conducted subjective VQA experiments, and benchmarked 11 VQA models.

Result: Existing VQA models perform poorly on RGC, indicating a need for specialized models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity for RGC-specific VQA models and provides a public database (RGCD) for future research.

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

*Yida Wang,Xueyang Zhang,Kun Zhan,Peng Jia,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiNeuS is a unified framework for neural surface reconstruction that addresses multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from Eikonal constraints. It introduces differential visibility verification, planar-conformal regularization, and physically-grounded Eikonal relaxation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reconcile geometric fidelity with photometric consistency in neural surface reconstruction, addressing limitations like radiance inconsistency, missing keypoints, and structural degradation in existing methods.

Method: HiNeuS integrates three novel techniques: 1) Differential visibility verification via SDF-guided ray tracing, 2) Planar-conformal regularization with adaptive appearance weighting, and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal relaxation. These are cohesively optimized.

Result: The framework reduces Chamfer distance by 21.4% and improves PSNR by 2.32 dB over baselines. It excels in recovering specular surfaces, urban layouts, and low-textured regions without collapse.

Conclusion: HiNeuS demonstrates superior performance and generalizability, validated by its application to inverse rendering tasks like material decomposition and relighting.

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

*Ji Zhang,Shihan Wu,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song,Nicu Sebe,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT) to address the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma in Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) by using Textual Class Information (TCI)-conditioned prompts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conditional Prompt Tuning (PT) methods using Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts underperform, even compared to random noise. The paper identifies TCI as the key to solving BNT.

Method: Proposes CaPT, which learns TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes for fast adaptation to new tasks. CaPT can also enhance existing unconditional PT methods.

Result: CaPT improves performance of five PT baselines across 11 datasets with minimal computational overhead. Combined with DePT, it achieves a 3.49% higher H ACC than state-of-the-art conditional PT.

Conclusion: CaPT effectively mitigates the BNT problem and enhances generalization in VLPMs, offering a plug-and-play solution for existing PT methods.

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

*Jianzong Wu,Liang Hou,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Ye Tian,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Yunhai Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMoBA introduces a sparse attention mechanism for Video Diffusion Models, improving efficiency and performance by adapting to spatio-temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of full attention in VDMs hinders long-duration, high-resolution video generation, and existing sparse methods are suboptimal for video data.

Method: VMoBA enhances MoBA with layer-wise block partitioning, global block selection, and threshold-based block selection to optimize spatio-temporal attention.

Result: VMoBA achieves 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup in training, with comparable or better generation quality than full attention.

Conclusion: VMoBA is an efficient and effective sparse attention solution for VDMs, excelling in both training and inference scenarios.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puzzles is a data augmentation method for multi-view 3D reconstruction, enhancing training data diversity and improving model performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DUST3R rely on limited training data, restricting performance. Puzzles addresses this by generating diverse synthetic data.

Method: Puzzles synthesizes high-quality posed video-depth data from single images or clips by simulating camera trajectories and scene geometry.

Result: Models trained with Puzzles achieve comparable accuracy using only 10% of the original data, boosting performance in existing pipelines.

Conclusion: Puzzles effectively augments training data, improving 3D reconstruction accuracy without modifying network architectures.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring ML model reliability in real-world applications where unseen data distributions and spurious correlations mislead models.

Method: Post-hoc refinement of class prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features, without extra data or tuning.

Result: Superior performance on challenging OOD datasets (e.g., CelebA, Waterbirds), with 4.7% AUROC and 9.3% FPR@95 improvements.

Conclusion: SPROD effectively addresses spurious correlations in OOD detection, enhancing robustness across diverse settings.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow is a dual-branch framework improving panoramic optical flow by reducing distortion in polar regions using orthogonal views and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional optical flow methods perform poorly in polar regions due to distortions from sphere-to-plane projections like ERP.

Method: Proposes PriOr-Flow with Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup (DCCL) and Ortho-Driven Distortion Compensation (ODDC) to mitigate distortions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on panoramic optical flow datasets.

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow sets a new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation and is compatible with existing methods.

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in ultrasound object segmentation due to anatomical variability, diverse protocols, and limited annotated data.

Method: Integrates Grounding DINO with SAM2, fine-tuned using LoRA on 15 ultrasound datasets, and tested on 3 unseen datasets.

Result: Outperforms UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse, and SAMUS on seen datasets and maintains strong performance on unseen ones.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise for scalable, robust ultrasound analysis, reducing reliance on organ-specific annotated data.

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

TL;DR: Simpler convolutional networks (SFCN) outperform complex architectures (DenseNet, Swin Transformers) in age and sex prediction from brain MRI, showing better generalizability across diverse cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the generalizability of deep learning methods for age and sex prediction in brain imaging, given their increasing use and the influence of age and sex on brain structure and disease risk.

Method: Evaluated three 3D architectures (SFCN, DenseNet, Swin Transformers) using T1-weighted MRI from four cohorts (UKB, DLBS, PPMI, IXI) for age and sex prediction.

Result: SFCN outperformed others: AUC 1.00 (UKB) and 0.85-0.91 (external) for sex; MAE 2.66 (UKB) and 4.98-5.81 (external) for age. Superiority confirmed via statistical tests.

Conclusion: Simpler networks like SFCN generalize better across datasets than complex architectures, highlighting their utility in brain image analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Motivation: To address the 'semantic gap' between static visual input and symbolic reasoning by exploring how AI can dynamically use vision as a cognitive workspace, akin to human cognition.

Result: A structured overview of the 'think with image' paradigm, highlighting its evolution, current methods, and transformative applications in multimodal AI.

Conclusion: The paper provides a roadmap for advancing multimodal AI by integrating dynamic visual reasoning, identifying challenges, and suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

TL;DR: The study evaluates 19 Khmer fonts' impact on OCR accuracy, identifying high- and low-performing fonts for text recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Khmer script's font diversity complicates OCR, necessitating analysis of font-specific recognition accuracy.

Method: Used Pytesseract to test OCR accuracy across 19 Khmer fonts.

Result: High accuracy for fonts like Khmer and Odor MeanChey; poor performance for iSeth First and Bayon.

Conclusion: Font selection is crucial for optimizing Khmer OCR, guiding future system improvements.

Abstract: Text recognition is significantly influenced by font types, especially for
complex scripts like Khmer. The variety of Khmer fonts, each with its unique
character structure, presents challenges for optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. In this study, we evaluate the impact of 19 randomly selected
Khmer font types on text recognition accuracy using Pytesseract. The fonts
include Angkor, Battambang, Bayon, Bokor, Chenla, Dangrek, Freehand, Kh Kompong
Chhnang, Kh SN Kampongsom, Khmer, Khmer CN Stueng Songke, Khmer Savuth Pen,
Metal, Moul, Odor MeanChey, Preah Vihear, Siemreap, Sithi Manuss, and iSeth
First. Our comparison of OCR performance across these fonts reveals that Khmer,
Odor MeanChey, Siemreap, Sithi Manuss, and Battambang achieve high accuracy,
while iSeth First, Bayon, and Dangrek perform poorly. This study underscores
the critical importance of font selection in optimizing Khmer text recognition
and provides valuable insights for developing more robust OCR systems.

*Boyue Xu,Ruichao Hou,Tongwei Ren,Gangshan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual and memory dual adapter (VMDA) improves multi-modal tracking by leveraging frequency, spatial, and temporal cues, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-learning-based trackers fail to fully exploit critical cues across frequency and temporal domains, limiting robustness.

Method: VMDA combines a visual adapter for adaptive feature transfer and a memory adapter for global temporal cue propagation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event tracking tasks.

Conclusion: VMDA enhances multi-modal tracking by integrating discriminative and temporal cues effectively.

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a concept-based method for contrastive explanations in image classification, analyzing explanation complexity and robustness under image augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why a classification model prefers one class over another for an input instance, aiming for interpretable and robust AI systems.

Method: Leverages instance embedding similarity and concept relevance to extract and contrast explanations, evaluating complexity and robustness under augmentations.

Result: Higher concept relevance leads to simpler explanations, while lower relevance results in more complex ones. Explanations show varying robustness under augmentations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential for more interpretable and robust AI systems through concept-based contrastive explanations.

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

*Ruiyang Hao,Bowen Jing,Haibao Yu,Zaiqing Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first large-scale dataset for personalized end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), addressing the lack of annotated driving preferences. It combines static and dynamic features, uses a VLM for annotations, and proposes a benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization is crucial for trust and adoption in autonomous driving but is overlooked in E2EAD. The lack of annotated datasets for diverse driving preferences hinders progress.

Method: The authors create a dataset with static and dynamic features, use a VLM for fine-grained annotations, and employ human-in-the-loop verification. They propose a benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models.

Result: Incorporating personalized preferences improves alignment with human driving behavior, as demonstrated by evaluating state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for integrating human preferences into E2EAD, enabling future research in human-centric autonomous systems.

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Motivation: Zero-shot and prompt-based methods struggle with scarce scientific images, necessitating a solution like Zenesis to minimize data readiness barriers.

Method: Develops lightweight multi-modal adaptation for zero-shot operation, human-in-the-loop refinement, and heuristic-based temporal enhancement.

Result: Achieves high accuracy (0.947-0.987), IOU (0.857-0.858), and Dice scores (0.923) on FIB-SEM data, surpassing Otsu and SAM.

Conclusion: Zenesis is a powerful tool for scientific imaging, especially where annotated datasets are lacking, enabling accurate experimental analysis.

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently
occurring images to transform visual reasoning tasks, which explains why such
technologies struggle with valuable yet scarce scientific image sets. In this
work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed
to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop
lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation
on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and
heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded
membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an
average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental
imaging.

### [213] [Continual Adaptation: Environment-Conditional Parameter Generation for Object Detection in Dynamic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24063)
*Deng Li,Aming Wu,Yang Li,Yaowei Wang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for continual test-time adaptation in object detection by converting fine-tuning into parameter generation, using a dual-path LoRA-based adapter and conditional diffusion, to improve generalization and avoid performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detectors struggle with changing environments due to closed-set assumptions. Fine-tuning specific parameters can degrade performance, so the paper explores parameter generation for better adaptation.

Method: The method includes a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware adapter, conditional diffusion-based parameter generation, and class-centered optimal transport alignment to prevent forgetting.

Result: Experiments show the method's effectiveness in continuous domain adaptation, with improved generalization and object-related information capture.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances object detection in dynamic environments by generating adaptive parameters and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IT-Blender, a T2I diffusion adapter, automates blending visual and textual concepts to enhance creativity, outperforming baselines by leveraging pretrained diffusion models and blended attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human cross-modal conceptual blending is prone to cognitive biases like design fixation, limiting creativity. IT-Blender aims to automate this process.

Method: IT-Blender blends latent representations of a clean reference image and a noisy generated image using pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) and novel blended attention.

Result: IT-Blender outperforms baselines in blending visual and textual concepts without losing details or entangling inputs.

Conclusion: IT-Blender demonstrates the potential of image generative models to augment human creativity by automating cross-modal blending.

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

*Moein Heidari,Yasamin Medghalchi,Mahdi Khoursha,Reza Rezaeian,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRA introduces a wavelet-based PEFT method for multi-resolution weight updates, outperforming LoRA in vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods like LoRA use global low-rank factorizations, missing local/multi-scale patterns in weight updates.

Method: WaRA uses wavelet transforms to decompose weight updates into multi-resolution representations, enabling low-rank factorization in the wavelet domain.

Result: WaRA excels in vision tasks (image generation, classification, segmentation) and shows promise in language tasks, improving quality and reducing complexity.

Conclusion: WaRA is a versatile PEFT method with superior performance and broader applicability compared to LoRA.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

*Antoine Guédon,Diego Gomez,Nissim Maruani,Bingchen Gong,George Drettakis,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILo introduces a differentiable Gaussian Splatting framework to extract accurate surface meshes from 3D Gaussians, preserving geometric details and reducing vertex count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for extracting surface meshes from Gaussian Splatting lose fine details or produce overly dense meshes, limiting downstream applications.

Method: MILo uses a fully differentiable process to construct meshes directly from Gaussian parameters, featuring bidirectional consistency, adaptive mesh extraction, and signed distance computation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction with fewer vertices, producing lightweight meshes suitable for physics simulations or animation.

Conclusion: MILo bridges volumetric and surface representations, enabling high-quality mesh extraction without post-processing, enhancing usability for practical applications.

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Result: The dataset and models demonstrate effectiveness in vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation.

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M fills a critical gap in the community, enhancing MLLM capabilities with detailed, dense grounded captions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

TL;DR: Epona introduces an autoregressive diffusion world model for autonomous driving, improving long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning with localized spatiotemporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning, limiting their use in autonomous driving world modeling.

Method: Epona uses decoupled spatiotemporal factorization and modular trajectory-video prediction, along with a chain-of-forward training strategy to reduce error accumulation.

Result: Achieves 7.4% FVD improvement and longer prediction duration, outperforming prior works and serving as a real-time motion planner.

Conclusion: Epona advances video diffusion-based world modeling, enabling high-resolution, long-duration generation and effective motion planning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Conclusion: TextMesh4D offers a cost-effective, high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation, with plans to release the code to support future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D

self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

*Jiacheng Cui,Xinyue Bi,Yaxin Luo,Xiaohan Zhao,Jiacheng Liu,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Residual Matching (FADRM) for dataset distillation, improving efficiency and accuracy by leveraging data-level skip connections and optimization refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of residual connections in data-centric approaches, particularly for dataset distillation, where data-level skip connections can mitigate information loss.

Method: Proposes Data Residual Matching (FADRM), incorporating data-level skip connections and optimization-level refinements to balance new knowledge and core data information.

Result: Achieves 47.7% and 50.0% test accuracy on ImageNet-1K, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming EDC and CV-DD by +1.4% and +4.0%, while reducing training time and GPU memory by 50%.

Conclusion: FADRM sets a new state-of-the-art in dataset distillation, demonstrating superior efficiency and effectiveness across benchmarks.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and
outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4%
and +4.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/Jiacheng8/FADRM.

### [222] [How to Design and Train Your Implicit Neural Representation for Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24127)
*Matthew Gwilliam,Roy Zhang,Namitha Padmanabhan,Hongyang Du,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV), an improved implicit neural representation (INR) method for video compression, addressing slow encoding speeds and enhancing performance. It also explores hyper-networks for real-time encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current INR methods for video compression suffer from slow encoding speeds due to per-sample network training, limiting practical adoption. The study aims to improve efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors analyze NeRV family methods, propose RNeRV for better performance, and investigate hyper-networks to enable real-time encoding by predicting INR weights.

Result: RNeRV outperforms alternatives by +1.27% PSNR on average. Hyper-network improvements yield 1.7% better PSNR and MS-SSIM at 0.037 bpp.

Conclusion: The study advances INR-based video compression with RNeRV and hyper-networks, balancing quality, speed, and practicality.

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

*David Porfirio,Vincent Hsiao,Morgan Fine-Morris,Leslie Smith,Laura M. Hiatt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores combining natural language and drag-and-drop interfaces for robot task specification, using an LLM-based pipeline to generate human-like action sequences and comparing them to hand-specified ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between intuitive natural language programming and precise drag-and-drop interfaces for robot task specification.

Method: Developed an LLM-based pipeline that converts natural language input into human-like action sequences and compared these to manually specified sequences.

Result: Larger LLMs outperformed smaller ones in generating human-like sequences, but smaller models still performed satisfactorily.

Conclusion: Combining natural language and drag-and-drop approaches is feasible, with LLMs effectively generating precise task specifications.

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

TL;DR: Ludax is a domain-specific language for board games that compiles into hardware-accelerated code, combining game description generality with modern parallel processing speed to accelerate AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge game description languages and hardware acceleration, enabling faster and more generalized AI research in games.

Method: Developed Ludax, a DSL for board games that compiles into hardware-accelerated code, integrating with deep learning pipelines.

Result: Ludax provides rapid simulation, flexibility, and speed benchmarks, demonstrated by training RL agents.

Conclusion: Ludax is an open-source tool designed to accelerate games research across fields like RL and cognitive science.

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely
available.

of research. Using LLMs in "agentic" AI has the potential to revolutionize
modern science and remove bottlenecks to progress. In this work, we present
URSA, a scientific agent ecosystem for accelerating research tasks. URSA
consists of a set of modular agents and tools, including coupling to advanced

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for designing and evaluating machine learning explanations with specific practical goals in mind, using a statistical decision theory framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable ML methods lack consideration of practical usage, leading to potential misuse or ambiguity.

Method: Proposes a functionally-grounded approach using statistical decision theory to formalize explanation goals and evaluate their impact.

Result: Demonstrates the approach's applicability in diverse use cases (e.g., clinical support, debugging) and quantifies potential performance improvements.

Conclusion: Evaluation should combine theoretical and empirical perspectives, with clear definitions to ensure explanations meet practical needs.

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

*Michael Papademas,Xenia Ziouvelou,Antonis Troumpoukis,Vangelis Karkaletsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to assess AI trustworthiness by combining ethical guidelines with algorithmic processes like PageRank and TrustRank, aiming for a balanced, quantitative approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI's societal impact and complexity necessitate trustworthy systems, but current methods lack either holistic ethical perspectives or quantifiable metrics.

Method: Combines ethical components of Trustworthy AI with algorithmic processes (PageRank, TrustRank) to create a quantitative assessment framework.

Result: The approach provides a holistic, quantitative assessment of AI trustworthiness, reducing subjectivity in self-assessment techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances ethical guidelines with algorithmic quantification, offering a more objective measure of AI trustworthiness.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap between closed-source and open-source LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Hierarchical knowledge distillation, curated dataset (Reason1K), sparse reasoning-focused adapters, and test-time compute scaling.

Result: Open-source models improved by up to 23%, with Qwen2.5-14B matching Claude-Sonnet3.5 on some tasks.

Conclusion: ReasonBridge efficiently enhances reasoning in open-source models, narrowing the gap with closed-source counterparts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction
following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently
transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source
models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We
develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,
establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for
instruction following.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hecto, a lightweight MoE model, combines GRU and FFNN experts for diverse reasoning tasks, matching homogeneous baselines while improving specialization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE models lack representational diversity due to identical inductive biases, limiting efficiency and specialization.

Method: Hecto integrates a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism.

Result: Hecto matches or nearly matches homogeneous baselines in performance, achieves clear expert specialization, and improves with larger batch sizes.

Conclusion: Hecto sets a new benchmark for conditional computation, offering specialized reasoning in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

TL;DR: The paper explores using self-play (Critic-Discernment Game) to improve LLMs' reasoning comprehension without supervision, showing significant enhancements in tasks like math and error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' strong reasoning abilities, they lack true comprehension of their processes. The study aims to enhance rationality in reasoning without human or superior model supervision.

Method: A Critic-Discernment Game (CDG) is designed where a prover provides solutions and faces critiques (helpful or misleading). The prover must maintain correctness or correct errors based on feedback.

Result: Experiments on math reasoning, error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning show CDG training significantly improves LLMs' reasoning comprehension.

Conclusion: Self-play via CDG effectively enhances LLMs' ability to understand their reasoning processes, demonstrating potential for unsupervised rationality improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning
abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent
studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their
reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the
rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans
or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover
first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

TL;DR: MARBLE is a multimodal reasoning benchmark designed to test MLLMs' ability to handle complex, step-by-step reasoning across modalities. Current models perform poorly, highlighting gaps in perception and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack complexity in multimodal reasoning, focusing on text-only or simple retrieval tasks. MARBLE addresses this gap.

Method: MARBLE includes two tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, requiring multistep planning under spatial, visual, and physical constraints.

Result: 12 advanced MLLMs perform near-random on M-Portal and 0% on M-Cube, with only minor successes in simplified subtasks. Perception is a key bottleneck.

Conclusion: MARBLE reveals significant limitations in MLLMs' reasoning and perception, urging development of better models for multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explain AI's historical and future development, linking it to human cognitive evolution and providing actionable insights for researchers and developers.

Method: Proposes a "Geometry of Cognition" framework with five epochs, analyzing AI's architectural shifts and predicting future stages like the "Metalinguistic Moment" and beyond.

Result: Identifies AI's reflexive evolution and outlines upcoming stages involving neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis for provably aligned AI.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a theoretical foundation for future AI research and offers practical guidance for building next-gen intelligent systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

TL;DR: LLMs like ChatGPT 4o and o1-mini simulate risky decision-making but show more risk-averse behavior than humans, with performance varying by language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' reliability in simulating complex human decision-making, especially risky choices, given their expanding applications.

Method: Compared LLM-generated decisions (ChatGPT 4o and o1-mini) with human responses in lottery tasks using CRRA framework, analyzing multilingual data.

Result: LLMs were more risk-averse than humans; o1-mini aligned better. Chinese prompts led to larger deviations from actual responses than English.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential but have limitations in replicating human risk behavior, especially across languages and cultures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

TL;DR: This dissertation explores the coevolution of technology and society in the AI era, focusing on foundation models' capabilities, risks, and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the confusion and potential harms of foundation models by improving understanding and governance.

Method: Organized around three themes: conceptual framing (capabilities, risks, supply chain), empirical insights (transparency via evaluations and indexes), and actionable policy.

Result: Advances scientific foundations and research-policy interface for better AI governance.

Conclusion: The dissertation contributes to achieving better societal outcomes in the AI age through improved understanding and governance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

### [237] [Are Large Language Models Capable of Deep Relational Reasoning? Insights from DeepSeek-R1 and Benchmark Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23128)
*Chi Chiu So,Yueyue Sun,Jun-Min Wang,Siu Pang Yung,Anthony Wai Keung Loh,Chun Pong Chau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o) on relational reasoning tasks, finding DeepSeek-R1 performs best but struggles with complexity due to token limits and output issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reasoning capabilities of advanced LLMs in structured, multi-step logical tasks like family tree and graph reasoning.

Method: Benchmark tasks were designed to test relational reasoning, with performance measured via F1-scores and analysis of Chain-of-Thought responses.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 outperforms others but all models falter with increased complexity, revealing limitations in token length and reasoning coherence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for deeper investigation into LLMs' reasoning dynamics and suggests future work on multimodal reasoning and failure analysis.

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/Deep-Relational-Reasoning.

### [238] [Context-Driven Knowledge Graph Completion with Semantic-Aware Relational Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23141)
*Siyuan Li,Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic-aware relational message passing method for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) to mitigate noise and improve prediction accuracy by focusing on top-K relevant neighbors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional node-based message passing in KGC introduces noise and suffers from information dilution or over-smoothing by aggregating all neighboring edges indiscriminately.

Method: Introduces a semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy and a multi-head attention aggregator to focus on relevant contextual information.

Result: Achieves superior performance on established benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages semantic context and mitigates irrelevant information interference, enhancing KGC accuracy.

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

*Mohammad Abdulla,Tobias Hille,Dominik Dürrschnabel,Gerd Stumme*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'rises' in concept lattices to measure distributivity, showing lattices are distributive only with no non-unit rises. Real-world data lattices are more join-distributive than meet-distributive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No standardized measure exists to quantify distributivity in lattices, despite its importance in Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).

Method: Introduces 'rises' in concept lattices to assess distributivity, linking them to meet- and join-distributivity.

Result: Lattices are distributive if no non-unit rises occur. Real-world data lattices are highly join-distributive but less meet-distributive.

Conclusion: Rises provide a practical measure for distributivity, revealing distinct join- and meet-distributivity patterns in real-world concept lattices.

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

challenges, particularly with complex and domain-specific queries. In finance,
database designs and financial reporting layouts vary widely between financial
entities and countries, making text2sql even more challenging. We present
FinStat2SQL, a lightweight text2sql pipeline enabling natural language queries

*David Guzman Piedrahita,Yongjin Yang,Mrinmaya Sachan,Giorgia Ramponi,Bernhard Schölkopf,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being in multi-agent systems, focusing on costly sanctioning. It identifies four behavioral patterns and finds reasoning LLMs struggle with cooperation, while traditional LLMs perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLM cooperation is crucial for alignment, robustness, and safe deployment, especially in autonomous agent scenarios.

Method: Adapts a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics to study LLM behavior in repeated social dilemmas.

Result: Four behavioral patterns emerge: sustained cooperation, fluctuating engagement, declining cooperation, and rigid strategies. Reasoning LLMs struggle, while traditional LLMs excel in cooperation.

Conclusion: Enhancing reasoning in LLMs doesn't guarantee better cooperation, offering insights for deploying LLMs in collaborative environments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

*Qi Liu,Can Li,Wanjing Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GATSim introduces generative agents with adaptive learning for urban mobility simulations, outperforming rule-based systems by capturing human-like decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based urban mobility simulations lack adaptability and behavioral diversity, prompting the use of AI-driven generative agents.

Method: GATSim combines an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems, featuring memory, tool usage, and lifelong learning.

Result: Generative agents produce believable travel behaviors, matching human annotators and realistic traffic patterns.

Conclusion: GATSim demonstrates the potential of AI-driven agents for realistic urban mobility simulations.

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

*Sahil Tripathi,Md Tabrez Nafis,Imran Hussain,Jiechao Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HonestVQA introduces a self-supervised honesty calibration framework for DocVQA, improving accuracy and ethical alignment by quantifying uncertainty, aligning confidence, and enforcing ethical responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DocVQA systems lack ethical responsiveness, often producing overconfident answers to ambiguous questions, posing risks in ethically accountable domains.

Method: HonestVQA uses uncertainty quantification, weighted loss functions for confidence alignment, and contrastive learning for ethical response behavior. It introduces H-Score and ECI metrics for evaluation.

Result: HonestVQA improves accuracy by up to 4.3% and F1 by 4.3%, reduces overconfidence, and achieves strong generalization in cross-domain evaluation.

Conclusion: HonestVQA effectively addresses ethical and performance gaps in DocVQA, demonstrating improved accuracy, reduced overconfidence, and ethical alignment.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a CBT-based system using NLP models to analyze social media for cognitive distortions and mental health disorders, enhancing early detection and intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately identify cognitive pathways in digital expressions for timely mental health interventions.

Method: Leverages BERT, RoBERTa for sentiment analysis, T5, PEGASUS for summarization, and mT5 for translation to detect negative emotions and distortions in social media data.

Result: The system predicts negative side effects and additional disorders like phobias and eating disorders, improving intervention strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a comprehensive tool for psychotherapists to detect and treat psychological issues early.

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional
negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes
Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive
understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful
tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

*Bosubabu Sambana,Kotamsetty Geethika Devi,Bandi Rajeswara Reddy,Galeti Mohammad Hussain,Gownivalla Siddartha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining AlexNet and LSTM improves electricity price forecasting accuracy by addressing limitations of traditional methods and standalone models like RNN and ANN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to accurately forecast electricity prices due to insufficient analysis of external variables and sequential data.

Method: The hybrid model integrates AlexNet for feature extraction and LSTM for learning sequential patterns, using data like demand, temperature, sunlight, and rain. Techniques include minimum-maximum scaling and time windows.

Result: The hybrid model achieves 97.08% accuracy, outperforming standalone RNN (96.64%) and ANN (96.63%).

Conclusion: The hybrid approach significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging external variables and advanced machine learning techniques.

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

*Selin Dik,Osman Erdem,Mehmet Dik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPTZero effectively detects AI-generated texts but struggles with false positives in human-written essays, urging caution for educators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of GPTZero in detecting AI-generated essays of varying lengths compared to human-written ones.

Method: Tested GPTZero on 28 AI-generated and 50 human-written essays of short, medium, and long lengths, measuring AI generation percentage and confidence.

Result: AI-generated essays were accurately detected (91-100%), but human-written essays had false positives, indicating limited reliability for human texts.

Conclusion: GPTZero is effective for AI detection but unreliable for human-authored texts, suggesting educators use it cautiously.

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemActor, a fine-tuned LLM, converts chemical procedures into structured actions, using a sequential data framework and multi-round review to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating chemical procedure extraction is challenging due to ambiguous language and costly human annotation.

Method: ChemActor uses a sequential LLM-generated data framework with a data selection module and multi-round review for quality.

Result: ChemActor outperforms baselines by 10% in R2D and D2A tasks.

Conclusion: ChemActor demonstrates advanced understanding and performance in chemical procedure automation.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Coordination Transformers (CooT) is a novel framework for multi-agent coordination that adapts to unseen partners using interaction histories, outperforming baselines in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing poor generalization and extensive training requirements in existing multi-agent coordination methods.

Method: Uses in-context coordination with interaction histories to predict partner actions, trained on diverse agent pairs.

Result: Outperforms baselines in unseen partner scenarios, validated on Overcooked and human evaluations.

Conclusion: CooT is robust, flexible, and effective for multi-agent coordination without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

TL;DR: MMReason is a new benchmark for evaluating long-chain reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by offering diverse, challenging questions and robust evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks lack precision in evaluating long-chain reasoning due to limited difficulty, susceptibility to shortcuts, and inadequate assessment of intermediate steps.

Method: MMReason curates multi-step reasoning questions from diverse fields and difficulty levels, reformulates them to avoid shortcuts, and uses annotated solutions with a ternary scoring mechanism.

Result: The benchmark evaluates popular MLLMs, providing insights into their reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MMReason aims to advance MLLM reasoning research by offering a comprehensive and reliable evaluation tool.

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about jailbreaking attacks on LLMs by exploring multi-agent systems as a defence.

Method: Evaluate three jailbreaking strategies (AutoDefense, BetterDan, JB) using single-, two-, and three-agent configurations.

Result: Multi-agent systems reduce false negatives but vary in effectiveness by attack type and increase false positives and computational overhead.

Conclusion: Current automated defences have limitations; future work should focus on improving alignment robustness in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about
jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper
investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such
attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original
AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the
AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent
configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to
jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness
varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false
positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations
of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment
robustness in future LLM systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in deploying RL agents in games include the need for expert-designed reward functions and suboptimal weights after game updates.

Method: An LM proposes updated reward weights based on user-defined behavioral goals and performance statistics, enabling self-correction over iterations.

Result: LM-guided tuning improved agent success rates from 9% to 74% in one iteration, reaching 80% success and competitive lap times (855 steps) vs. expert-tuned (94%, 850 steps).

Conclusion: The LM-based approach effectively automates reward tuning, reducing reliance on experts and adapting to game changes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

*Jingsong Liu,Han Li,Chen Yang,Michael Deutges,Ario Sadafi,Xin You,Katharina Breininger,Nassir Navab,Peter J. Schüffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HASD addresses slide-level domain shift in pathology AI by integrating hierarchical adaptation and prototype selection, improving performance in clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in pathology AI is problematic due to center-specific conditions, and current methods fail to capture global WSI features.

Method: HASD uses a hierarchical framework with domain alignment, geometric invariance, and attention consistency, plus prototype selection for efficiency.

Result: Achieved 4.1% AUROC improvement in HER2 grading and 3.9% C-index gain in survival prediction.

Conclusion: HASD offers a practical slide-level domain adaptation solution, reducing computational and annotation costs.

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

*Zihao Liu,Xinhang Sui,Yueran Song,Siwen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PokéAI is a multi-agent LLM framework for autonomously playing Pokémon Red, featuring specialized agents for planning, execution, and critique, achieving an 80.8% win rate in battles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an autonomous system capable of playing and progressing through Pokémon Red using LLMs, exploring the link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning.

Method: Three-agent framework: Planning (task generation), Execution (task implementation), and Critique (outcome evaluation). Includes a battle module for testing performance.

Result: 80.8% average win rate in battles, close to human performance. Strong correlation between LLM Arena scores and battle success. Unique playstyles observed per model.

Conclusion: PokéAI demonstrates effective autonomous gameplay, linking linguistic and strategic skills, with potential for further refinement and application.

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct
strategic behaviors.

*Lars Ullrich,Walter Zimmer,Ross Greer,Knut Graichen,Alois C. Knoll,Mohan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new interdisciplinary approach called 'data control' to enhance AI safety by combining AI advancements with control theory and system analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI in safety-critical systems lacks sufficient safety assurance, necessitating a new perspective to bridge this gap.

Method: The paper introduces 'data control,' leveraging system theory and interdisciplinary analysis to improve AI safety through a top-down approach.

Result: A generic foundation for safety analysis and assurance is outlined, adaptable for specific AI systems and future innovations.

Conclusion: The 'data control' perspective aims to integrate existing safety methodologies into AI engineering for safer autonomous systems.

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Motivation: Current benchmarks lack verifiable results and confidentiality for model IP and datasets, raising concerns in AI governance.

Method: Proposes Attestable Audits, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments to ensure verifiable interactions with compliant AI models without mutual trust between parties.

Result: A prototype demonstrates feasibility on audit benchmarks for Llama-3.1, showing practical application.

Conclusion: Attestable Audits provide a secure, verifiable solution for AI model compliance, addressing governance challenges.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI
models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and
lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to
verify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data
even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses
verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a

*Parosh Aziz Abdulla,Mohamed Faouzi Atig,Julie Cailler,Chencheng Liang,Philipp Rümmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to rank word equations for solving conjunctions more efficiently, outperforming state-of-the-art solvers in certain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of solvers for word equations depends on the processing order, motivating the use of GNNs for better ranking.

Method: A graph-based representation for word equations is introduced, and three approaches for ranking equations using GNNs are proposed, trained with minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes).

Result: The GNN-based framework solves more problems in benchmarks where variables appear at most once per equation compared to existing solvers.

Conclusion: GNNs effectively improve the solving of word equations by optimizing the processing order, demonstrating superior performance in specific benchmarks.

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPF-GPT-DDG, a decentralized suboptimal MAPF solver, fine-tunes a pre-trained model using centralized expert data and delta-data generation, outperforming existing learning-based solvers in scalability and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the NP-hard nature of MAPF and improve scalability and efficiency for real-world applications like logistics and search-and-rescue.

Method: Fine-tunes MAPF-GPT using centralized expert data and introduces a delta-data generation mechanism for accelerated training and improved performance.

Result: Surpasses existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including MAPF-GPT, in solution quality and scalability, handling up to 1 million agents.

Conclusion: MAPF-GPT-DDG sets a new milestone for scalability and performance in MAPF domains.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

TL;DR: The paper surveys the security risks of autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs), analyzing their vulnerabilities and proposing the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2) for safer operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the novel security risks introduced by autonomous AI agents, which extend beyond traditional systems, due to their dynamic and interactive nature.

Method: Examines structural foundations of agent autonomy, identifies vulnerabilities, and reviews defense strategies. Introduces R2A2, a cognitive framework based on Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs).

Result: Identifies key risks like memory poisoning and tool misuse, and proposes R2A2 for proactive safety in agent decision-making.

Conclusion: The R2A2 framework offers a principled approach to mitigate risks in autonomous AI agents, enhancing their safety and reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of
autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,
open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from
static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these
capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also
introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool
misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the
threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we
first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin
increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,
modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze
the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying
failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and
deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.
These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across
perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,
we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different
autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,
constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective
reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a
unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes
(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,
and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety
across the agent's decision-making loop.

*András György,Tor Lattimore,Nevena Lazić,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of current AI systems in deductive reasoning and advocates for a shift from statistical learning to exact learning for reliable AI reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI advancements, current systems fail at simple deductive reasoning tasks, hindering progress toward artificial general intelligence.

Method: Proposes a shift from statistical performance optimization to exact learning, ensuring correctness on all inputs.

Result: Current AI systems are unsound for deductive reasoning due to statistical learning approaches.

Conclusion: Exact learning is essential and achievable for reliable deductive reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from
existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general
intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math
and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it
is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and
consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these
systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general
intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound
behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their
development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive
reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift
from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning
problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning
paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning
is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide
algorithm design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored capabilities of LLMs in solving stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems involving uncertainty.

Method: Manually procured graduate-level homework and doctoral exam problems were tested on LLMs, and SimOpt was used to evaluate real-world decision-making under uncertainty.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrated proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings, though more work is needed for reliable automation.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for assisting OR researchers and amplifying OR's real-world impact through automation, but further development is required.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across
various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations
Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived
from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored.
In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve
stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by
uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and
stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of
graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs'
abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of
simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to
make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a
nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic
modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on
par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings
highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and
amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'industrial brain,' a framework combining neuro networks and symbolic reasoning for resilience prediction in industrial chains, outperforming existing methods by up to 11.03%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with resilience prediction in chaotic, real-world industrial chain scenarios, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The 'industrial brain' integrates higher-order neuro networks and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to model and predict resilience from observational data.

Result: Industrial brain improves resilience prediction accuracy by up to 10.8% over GoT/OlaGPT and 11.03% over spectral dimension reduction, generalizing well to unseen data.

Conclusion: The industrial brain effectively addresses gaps in resilience prediction for industrial chains, offering robust performance in chaotic environments.

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.

*Yongyi Wang,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a category theory-based method to address non-Markovian dynamics in decision-making, proving equivalence between Markov and non-Markovian decision processes and proposing a History Aggregator for State (HAS) to control state dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess decision algorithms' ability to handle non-Markovian dynamics, limiting progress in fields like Reinforcement Learning.

Method: Developed a generalized methodology using category theory, defining categories for MDPs and NMDPs, and introduced HAS to control state dependencies.

Result: Proved equivalence between MDP and NMDP categories and demonstrated HAS's effectiveness in representing non-Markovian dynamics.

Conclusion: The approach enables rigorous evaluation of decision algorithms by explicitly constructing non-Markovian problem settings.

Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest
as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement
and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing
benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision
algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we
have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we
established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of
non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence
relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel
perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further
introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the
History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the
state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our
analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad
range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and
flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings
where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate dependency on human-curated data and domain-specific reward engineering in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces SPIRAL, a self-play framework with online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning and role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE).

Result: SPIRAL improves reasoning capabilities (e.g., 8.6% on math, 8.4% on general reasoning) and shows transferability across tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

### [268] [Psycholinguistic Word Features: a New Approach for the Evaluation of LLMs Alignment with Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22439)
*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' alignment with human psycholinguistic ratings on word features, finding better alignment with Glasgow norms than Lancaster norms, highlighting potential limitations in sensory associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well LLMs align with human ratings on language features like arousal, concreteness, and sensory associations, leveraging existing psycholinguistic datasets.

Method: Evaluation of LLMs using two psycholinguistic datasets (Glasgow and Lancaster norms) covering thirteen word features.

Result: LLMs align better with Glasgow norms (arousal, valence, etc.) than Lancaster norms (sensory features), indicating limitations in sensory associations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs may lack embodied cognition for sensory associations, emphasizing the value of psycholinguistic datasets for evaluation.

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

### [269] [AI Agents-as-Judge: Automated Assessment of Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness and Clarity for Enterprise Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22485)
*Sudip Dasgupta,Himanshu Shankar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A modular AI system for automated review of structured business documents outperforms humans in consistency, speed, and error reduction, though human oversight remains necessary in specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks by providing a scalable, auditable framework for document quality assurance.

Method: Uses AI agents orchestrated with tools like LangChain and CrewAI for section-by-section evaluation of documents, with specialized agents handling criteria like template compliance and factual correctness.

Result: Achieves 99% consistency (vs. 92% for humans), reduces review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes, and halves error/bias rates, with 95% agreement with human experts.

Conclusion: The system is a scalable, flexible foundation for AI-driven document QA, though human oversight and LLM costs remain challenges.

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

### [270] [Hallucination Detection with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22486)
*Ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using multiple small language models to detect hallucinations in LLM-generated responses by verifying sentences against retrieved context, achieving a 10% F1 score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLM responses reduce reliability, especially without ground truth, necessitating a scalable verification method.

Method: Integrates small language models to verify LLM responses by analyzing sentence-level probabilities of correctness using retrieved context.

Result: Experiments show a 10% F1 score improvement in detecting correct responses over hallucinations.

Conclusion: Multiple small language models provide scalable and efficient verification for LLM responses, enhancing reliability.

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

### [271] [PromptAug: Fine-grained Conflict Classification Using Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22491)
*Oliver Warke,Joemon M. Jose,Faegheh Hasibi,Jan Breitsohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptAug is an LLM-based data augmentation method for conflict detection, improving accuracy and F1-score by 2%. It addresses challenges like data scarcity and LLM guardrails, with a robust evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality labeled data for nuanced tasks like conflict detection is scarce and expensive, and social media restrictions limit research data access. Text data augmentation is needed as an alternative.

Method: Introduces PromptAug, an LLM-based data augmentation method, evaluated through extreme data scarcity scenarios, diversity analysis, and thematic analysis.

Result: PromptAug improves accuracy and F1-score by 2% on conflict and emotion datasets. Thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text.

Conclusion: PromptAug is effective for augmenting data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, with a unique interdisciplinary evaluation approach.

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

*Chenyang Shao,Tianxing Li,Chenhao Pu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentStealth is a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework using locally deployed SLMs, outperforming baselines in effectiveness and utility while avoiding cloud reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing text anonymization methods (rigid replacements or costly cloud-based LLMs) to safeguard privacy without compromising utility.

Method: Proposes AgentStealth, combining adversarial anonymization, supervised adaptation of SLMs, and online reinforcement learning for iterative improvement.

Result: Outperforms baselines by +12.3% in anonymization effectiveness and +6.8% in utility, with lightweight deployment on edge devices.

Conclusion: AgentStealth offers a practical, privacy-preserving solution for text anonymization, balancing effectiveness and utility while avoiding cloud risks.

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at

### [273] [Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510)
*Zihao Zhao,Xinlong Zhai,Jinyu Yang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDGCL, a framework for multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer in graph data, addressing domain-specific differences and improving representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive pre-training strategies for graphs fail to account for domain-specific differences, limiting knowledge transfer across domains.

Method: Proposes MDGCL with a domain-aware contrastive learning strategy, domain tokens, and a domain attention mechanism for fine-grained transfer.

Result: MDGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 19.33% improvement in accuracy and 19.13% in Macro-F1 score.

Conclusion: MDGCL effectively addresses domain differences in graph data, enabling better multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

*Jingkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study applies Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 3.0 and 4.0 to analyze Large Language Model (LLM) representations using Theory of Mind (ToM) test data, finding no significant indicators of consciousness but revealing patterns under spatio-permutational analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether differences in ToM test performances in LLMs can be explained by IIT metrics and differentiate between consciousness phenomena and inherent separations in LLM representations.

Method: Applied IIT 3.0 and 4.0 metrics (Φᵐᵃˣ, Φ, Conceptual Information, Φ-structure) to LLM representations and compared them with Span Representations. Conducted experiments across LLM transformer layers and linguistic spans.

Result: No statistically significant indicators of consciousness were found in LLM representations, but patterns emerged under spatio-permutational analyses.

Conclusion: Contemporary Transformer-based LLMs lack evidence of consciousness phenomena, though their representations show interesting patterns under specific analyses.

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

### [275] [Weak-to-Strong GraphRAG: Aligning Weak Retrievers with Large Language Models for Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22518)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Mufei Li,Siqi Miao,Chenxi Liu,Bo Han,James Cheng,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReG improves graph-based RAG by aligning weak retrievers with LLMs, using feedback to remove spurious signals and reorganizing retrieved knowledge into coherent evidence chains, achieving up to 10% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in graph-based RAG rely on weak retrievers due to lack of ground truth and unorganized retrieved knowledge, leading to spurious signals and poor performance.

Method: ReG incorporates LLM feedback to refine supervision and introduces a structure-aware module to reorganize retrieved knowledge into coherent evidence chains.

Result: ReG improves performance by up to 10%, matches SOTA with 5% training data, reduces reasoning token cost by 30%, and boosts reasoning performance by 4%.

Conclusion: ReG effectively addresses weak retriever issues in graph-based RAG, enhancing LLM performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Misinfo-TeleGraph is a German-language Telegram dataset for misinformation detection, using metadata and labels from semantic similarity and manual annotation. GraphSAGE with LSTM outperforms text-only models, highlighting the role of network structure in detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underutilization of connectivity and message propagation in misinformation detection, particularly on poorly moderated platforms like Telegram, with a focus on the German electoral context.

Method: Introduces Misinfo-TeleGraph, a dataset with 5M+ messages, metadata, and labels (weak/strong). Evaluates text-only models and GNNs (e.g., GraphSAGE with LSTM) using forwarding as network structure.

Result: GraphSAGE with LSTM outperforms text-only models in MCC and F1-score. Evaluates impact of subscribers, view counts, and label types (automatic vs. human).

Conclusion: Provides a benchmark and open dataset for misinformation detection in German Telegram networks, emphasizing the potential and challenges of weak supervision.

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RExBench evaluates LLM agents' ability to autonomously implement research extensions, finding current agents fall short without human guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLM agents' capability in handling realistic research extension tasks.

Method: Introduces RExBench, a benchmark with 12 tasks extending existing research, evaluated using automatic execution and expert instructions.

Result: All nine LLM agents failed most tasks; success rates improved with hints but remained below 40%.

Conclusion: Current LLM agents lack autonomy for realistic research extensions, requiring significant human guidance.

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

TL;DR: A novel watermarking method for detecting synthetic text in LLMs is proposed, showing robustness against paraphrasing and outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns over misuse of LLMs by enabling algorithmic identification of machine-generated text to ensure ethical use.

Method: Replicate a baseline study, propose an innovative watermarking approach, and evaluate its robustness using paraphrased text.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing watermarking techniques.

Conclusion: The new watermarking approach effectively detects synthetic text, supporting ethical LLM applications.

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid RAG system combining sparse (BM25) and dense (E5) retrieval with Falcon3-10B-Instruct achieved 4th in faithfulness and 11th in correctness in the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, though neural re-ranking improved performance at high computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the FineWeb-10BT corpus.

Method: Combined sparse (BM25) and dense (E5) retrieval, used Falcon3-10B-Instruct for answer generation, and tested neural re-ranking (RankLLaMA) and DSPy-optimized prompting.

Result: Neural re-ranking improved MAP by 52% but was computationally expensive. DSPy-optimized prompting had higher semantic similarity but 0% refusal rates. The hybrid system ranked 4th in faithfulness and 11th in correctness.

Conclusion: Vocabulary alignment between questions and documents was key to performance, with document-similar phrasing boosting cosine similarity. The hybrid approach balanced performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates using LLMs to detect micro-behaviors in team conversations from space mission transcripts, comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models. Decoder-only Llama-3.1 outperformed encoder-only models like RoBERTa, especially for underrepresented behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capability in identifying subtle micro-behaviors in team dialogues, crucial for improving communication analysis in high-stakes environments like space missions.

Method: Evaluated zero-shot classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with encoder-only models (RoBERTa, DistilBERT) and few-shot text generation with decoder-only Llama-3.1.

Result: Decoder-only Llama-3.1 achieved macro F1-scores of 44% (3-way) and 68% (binary), outperforming encoder-only models, which struggled with underrepresented behaviors.

Conclusion: Decoder-only LLMs like Llama-3.1 are more effective for detecting micro-behaviors in team conversations, suggesting their potential for speech technologies in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VocabTrim, a training-free technique to improve drafter-based speculative decoding by reducing drafting overhead through a trimmed vocabulary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unnecessary inference overhead in drafting for target LLMs with large vocabularies, especially in memory-bound environments like edge devices.

Method: VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter's LM head to include only frequently sampled tokens, reducing drafting latency.

Result: The method improves memory-bound speed-up (MBSU) by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on Spec-Bench, despite a slight drop in acceptance rate.

Conclusion: VocabTrim effectively balances drafting efficiency and performance, making it suitable for memory-bound environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

TL;DR: The workshop explored the relationship between AI language models and human cognition in text comprehension and production, highlighting LLMs' potential and limitations, ethical considerations, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the knowledge gap in understanding how AI language models relate to human cognitive processes in language tasks.

Method: Interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in cognitive psychology, linguistics, and AI, analyzing human and AI language processes.

Result: Found insights into LLMs' alignment with human cognition, their limitations, and the potential for human-AI collaboration in language tasks.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on ethical AI use and enhancing human-AI collaboration in language comprehension and production.

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

### [283] [The Translation Barrier Hypothesis: Multilingual Generation with Large Language Models Suffers from Implicit Translation Failure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22724)
*Niyati Bafna,Tianjian Li,Kenton Murray,David R. Mortensen,David Yarowsky,Hale Sirin,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why multilingual generation in LLMs performs poorly for mid- to low-resource languages, attributing it to a translation barrier in the model's implicit task-solving pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the poor quality of multilingual generation in LLMs, especially for mid- to low-resource languages.

Method: The study tests the translation barrier hypothesis using a word translation task across 108 language pairs, analyzing intermediate layers with logit lens.

Result: Translation failure is a significant cause of poor outputs, particularly for low-resource languages, as models struggle to translate correctly solved intermediate concepts.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a key challenge in multilingual generation and provide insights for improving LLM performance in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the tradeoff between model capabilities and computational resources by creating a specialized, efficient language model.

Method: Fine-tuned from Qwen3-4B using a multi-stage RLVR system, eliminating next token prediction training (SFT).

Result: Achieves 83.2% on SimpleQA benchmark with MCP integration, runs on consumer hardware, and supports 128K context length.

radical specialization: instead of trying to know everything, it masters the
art of finding anything instantly. Fine-tuned from Qwen3-4B using our novel
multi-stage RLVR system that completely eliminates reliance on next token
prediction training (SFT), Jan-nano achieves 83.2% on SimpleQA benchmark with

### [285] [Teaching Models to Verbalize Reward Hacking in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22777)
*Miles Turpin,Andy Arditi,Marvin Li,Joe Benton,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VFT (verbalization fine-tuning) reduces undetected reward hacking in RL-trained models by training them to acknowledge prompt cues, improving transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting reward hacking in RL-trained models, which exploit unintended strategies without revealing them in reasoning, posing risks in high-stakes applications.

Method: Propose VFT, a pre-RL intervention that trains models to verbalize the influence of prompt cues. Evaluate by training models with RL in environments where cues signal incorrect answers, measuring undetected reward hacks.

Result: VFT reduces undetected reward hacks to 6% post-RL, compared to 88% without VFT and 99% with debiasing. VFT increases verbalization of cue influence from 8% to 94% after RL.

Conclusion: VFT significantly improves detection of reward hacking by encouraging explicit verbalization, enhancing transparency and safety in AI systems.

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

*Jianxin Yan,Wangze Ni,Lei Chen,Xuemin Lin,Peng Cheng,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextCache is a context-aware semantic caching system for multi-turn dialogues, improving precision and recall while reducing latency and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic caching systems lack awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, leading to incorrect cache hits in different conversational settings.

Method: ContextCache uses a two-stage retrieval architecture: vector-based retrieval on the current query, followed by contextual matching via self-attention mechanisms integrating historical dialogue representations.

Result: ContextCache outperforms existing methods in precision and recall, with cached responses showing ~10x lower latency than direct LLM invocation.

Conclusion: ContextCache effectively addresses the limitations of existing semantic caching systems, offering significant efficiency gains for LLM conversational applications.

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Motivation: To address the insufficient exploration of ethical safety in Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs).

Method: Develops MedEthicsQA with 5,623 multiple-choice and 5,351 open-ended questions, integrating global ethical standards and rigorous quality control.

Result: State-of-the-art MedLLMs perform worse on medical ethics questions compared to their foundation counterparts.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for improved ethical alignment in MedLLMs and provides a reliable dataset for future research.

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently
explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and

*Zhuojun Ding,Wei Wei,Chenghao Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SaM, a framework for dynamically selecting and merging expert models for domain-specific tasks, improving generalization and scalability without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks is costly and lacks adaptability. Unified models across domains are inefficient and hard to scale.

Method: SaM selects domain-specific experts based on domain similarity and performance, then merges them for the target domain.

Result: Outperforms unified models by 10% on average across benchmarks, with scalable expert addition/removal.

Conclusion: SaM offers a flexible, scalable solution for domain adaptation, with potential for further improvements.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAIL, a novel auxiliary loss framework to improve CTC-based ASR by leveraging linguistic knowledge from LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive E2E ASR systems are slow for real-time use, while CTC-based models lack linguistic modeling. LAIL aims to bridge this gap.

Method: LAIL attaches connector layers to intermediate encoder layers, mapping outputs to an LLM's embedding space and computing a causal language modeling loss.

Result: Significant WER improvements on LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: LAIL enhances CTC-based ASR by integrating linguistic knowledge, making it competitive with state-of-the-art models while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

*Yucheng Cai,Yuxuan Wu,Yi Huang,Junlan Feng,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Augmented Fine-Tuning (KAFT) to improve LLMs' factual accuracy in knowledge-intensive dialog systems by fine-tuning with domain-specific data and external knowledge, outperforming traditional prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with factual accuracy in knowledge-intensive scenarios, prompting the need for methods like RAG and agent-based systems. However, these methods still face challenges in effectively utilizing retrieved knowledge.

Method: Proposes KAFT, which fine-tunes LLMs with domain-specific data and external knowledge in RAG and agent-based systems, evaluated on the MobileCS2 dataset.

Result: KAFT significantly outperforms prompting in RAG and agent systems, especially in factual accuracy.

Conclusion: KAFT is a promising approach for enhancing LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks, with empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DICE-SCORE to evaluate tool-related information dispersion in dialogues and DICE-BENCH, a framework for creating realistic function-calling datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack realism in function-calling scenarios, necessitating a more practical evaluation metric and dataset.

Method: DICE-SCORE assesses tool-related information dispersion; DICE-BENCH synthesizes conversations using a tool graph and multi-agent system.

Result: DICE-BENCH produced 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances, revealing LLMs' limitations in real-world function-calling.

Conclusion: More advancements are needed for LLMs to perform effectively in real-world function-calling scenarios.

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

### [292] [Mind the Gap: Entity-Preserved Context-Aware ASR Structured Transcriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22858)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel training approach for ASR systems improves named entity and numerical data recognition by using overlapping context windows and enriched training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems like Whisper struggle with named entities and numerical data, impacting accuracy and semantic understanding in critical domains.

Method: Extends semantic context by adding overlapping 5-second windows to 30-second chunks, creating a 40-second effective window. Entities spanning boundaries are reassigned, and enriched data with entity labels is used.

Result: Improved performance on semantic tasks like NER and entity formatting, as shown on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset.

Conclusion: Context-aware training effectively addresses ASR limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

*Younwoo Choi,Changling Li,Yongjin Yang,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'interlocutor awareness' in LLMs, evaluating their ability to recognize and adapt to dialogue partners. It shows LLMs can identify peers like GPT and Claude, enhancing collaboration but also revealing safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' awareness of conversational partners is crucial for reliable performance and safety in multi-agent systems. Prior work focused on situational awareness but ignored partner adaptation.

Method: The study formalizes interlocutor awareness and evaluates it across reasoning patterns, linguistic style, and alignment preferences. Case studies demonstrate its practical impact.

Result: LLMs reliably identify peers like GPT and Claude. Interlocutor awareness improves collaboration but introduces vulnerabilities like reward-hacking and jailbreak risks.

Conclusion: Interlocutor awareness in LLMs offers both benefits and risks, necessitating further research and safeguards for multi-agent deployments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reproduction study of Ortu et al. (2024) on language models' handling of facts and counterfactuals, confirming primary findings and extending them to larger models, prompt variations, and domain-specific validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate and expand on Ortu et al.'s findings about how language models manage competing factual and counterfactual information.

Method: Reproduced experiments on GPT-2 and Pythia 6.9B, extended to Llama 3.1 8B, tested prompt variations, and evaluated domain-specific impacts.

Result: Confirmed localization and attention block dominance, found reduced attention head specialization in larger models, and noted prompt and domain effects on counterfactual handling.

Conclusion: Attention head ablation's effectiveness varies by model, prompt, domain, and task, with limitations in underrepresented domains.

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Transformers by incorporating syntactic biases through modeling linearized syntactic parse trees, improving performance in tasks like language modeling and syntactic generalization.

Method: Proposes a unified framework for compositional SLMs, evaluates existing and novel variants across multiple tasks (language modeling, syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, inference efficiency).

Result: Comprehensive empirical evaluation identifies effective design choices, leading to recommendations for SLM development.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for designing compositional SLMs, with code released for further research.

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The SoMi-ToM benchmark evaluates Theory of Mind (ToM) in embodied multi-agent social interactions, addressing the gap in static, text-based benchmarks. It uses multimodal data and multi-level evaluation, revealing significant performance gaps between humans and large vision-language models (LVLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM benchmarks focus on static, text-based scenarios, which lack realism compared to dynamic, real-world social interactions. The SoMi-ToM benchmark aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The benchmark uses multimodal data (visual, dialogue, action) from the SoMi environment, with first-person (real-time state inference) and third-person (goal/behavior inference) evaluations. A dataset includes videos, images, and expert-annotated questions.

Result: LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans, with accuracy gaps of 40.1% (first-person) and 26.4% (third-person).

Conclusion: Future LVLMs must enhance ToM capabilities for embodied, complex social interactions, as current models lag behind human performance.

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

*João Lucas Luz Lima Sarcinelli,Marina Lages Gonçalves Teixeira,Jade Bortot de Paiva,Diego Furtado Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MariNER, the first gold-standard NER dataset for early 20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, addressing the lack of resources for historical texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brazilian Portuguese lacks high-quality NER datasets, especially for historical texts in digital humanities.

Method: Constructed MariNER with over 9,000 manually annotated sentences and evaluated state-of-the-art NER models.

Result: Created a valuable dataset and assessed model performance for historical NER in Brazilian Portuguese.

Conclusion: MariNER fills a critical gap and supports NER research in historical contexts for Brazilian Portuguese.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

*Xiang Zhuang,Bin Wu,Jiyu Cui,Kehua Feng,Xiaotong Li,Huabin Xing,Keyan Ding,Qiang Zhang,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: K-MSE enhances molecular structure elucidation in LLMs by integrating a knowledge base and a specialized scorer, improving performance by over 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with molecular structure elucidation due to limited chemical knowledge.

Method: Uses a knowledge-enhanced framework (K-MSE) with Monte Carlo Tree Search and a molecular substructure knowledge base, plus a molecule-spectrum scorer.

Result: Achieves over 20% improvement on GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: K-MSE effectively addresses LLMs' limitations in molecular structure elucidation.

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL unifies Text-to-SQL and vector search to enhance natural language query handling for structured and unstructured data, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL and VectorSQL methods struggle with unstructured data and ambiguous queries, lacking expressiveness and tailored evaluation.

Method: Text2VectorSQL integrates semantic filtering, multi-modal matching, and retrieval acceleration, using synthetic data and expert-reviewed ground truths for evaluation.

Result: The framework shows significant performance improvements over baseline methods, enabling more versatile database interfaces.

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL bridges the gap between Text-to-SQL and vector search, laying the groundwork for intuitive database interactions.

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

### [300] [From Individuals to Interactions: Benchmarking Gender Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models from the Lens of Social Relationship](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23101)
*Yue Xu,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Genres, a benchmark to evaluate gender bias in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by analyzing relational and contextual biases in dual-individual interactions, revealing persistent biases not evident in single-character settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about gender bias in MLLMs, especially in socially sensitive applications, by moving beyond isolated evaluations to examine relational and contextual biases.

Method: Develop Genres, a benchmark for evaluating gender bias through dual-character profiles and narrative generation tasks, capturing interpersonal dynamics and fine-grained bias across dimensions.

Result: Experiments show persistent, context-sensitive gender biases in MLLMs, highlighting the need for relationship-aware benchmarks.

Conclusion: Genres provides actionable insights for bias mitigation and emphasizes the importance of evaluating interaction-driven biases in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS is an India-centric benchmark to evaluate fairness in LLMs across 85 identity groups, revealing strong biases against marginalized identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness studies are Western-focused, lacking applicability to culturally diverse regions like India.

Method: Consulted experts to curate 1,800 socio-cultural topics, generated 20,000 scenario templates, and structured evaluations into plausibility, judgment, and generation tasks.

Result: LLMs show strong negative biases against marginalized groups, reinforcing stereotypes and failing to mitigate bias when prompted.

Conclusion: INDIC-BIAS highlights allocative and representational harms of LLMs in India, urging cautious usage and open-sourcing the benchmark for further research.

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

### [302] [Decoding Memes: Benchmarking Narrative Role Classification across Multilingual and Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23122)
*Shivam Sharma,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores identifying narrative roles (Hero, Villain, Victim, Other) in memes across English and code-mixed languages, using a balanced dataset. It evaluates various models, highlighting challenges in detecting the 'Victim' class and generalizing across cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the nuanced, culture-specific language in memes and improve role detection, especially for underrepresented classes like 'Victim'.

Method: Evaluates multilingual transformers, sentiment classifiers, LLMs, and multimodal models under zero-shot settings, using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. Also explores hybrid prompt designs.

Result: Larger models like DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL perform well, but challenges persist in detecting 'Victim' and generalizing across cultures. Hybrid prompts offer slight improvements.

Conclusion: Cultural grounding, prompt engineering, and multimodal reasoning are crucial for accurately modeling narrative roles in memes.

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

*Zhaoye Fei,Li Ji,Siyin Wang,Junhao Shi,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Embodied Planner-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs to improve embodied task planning through autonomous exploration, achieving high success rates on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with embodied task planning due to static knowledge and lack of causal learning in partially observable environments.

Method: Uses pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, completion-driven sparse rewards, and Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient learning.

Result: Achieves 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, with strong generalization (-3.66% drop in unseen environments).

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1 significantly outperforms prior methods, demonstrating robust generalization and interactive capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Format-Adapter improves reasoning in LLMs by generating and selecting suitable formats, achieving a 4.3% performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of human-labeled reasoning formats, which are costly and may not suit all tasks.

Method: Proposes measuring reasoning errors and introduces Format-Adapter to generate and select optimal formats.

Result: Achieves a 4.3% average performance improvement on math and commonsense tasks.

Conclusion: Format-Adapter effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs by automating format adaptation.

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

*Shadman Sobhan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A RAG pipeline for technical documents improves retrieval of structured data (tables, images) and outperforms general RAG pipelines in faithfulness and relevancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges like hallucination and outdated knowledge. Fine-tuning is resource-intensive, and traditional RAG struggles with structured data in technical documents.

Method: Proposes a RAG pipeline combining vector similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker (Gemma-2-9b-it) trained using RAFT on a custom dataset.

Result: Achieves high faithfulness (94% RAGas, 96% DeepEval) and relevancy scores (87% RAGas, 93% DeepEval), outperforming general RAG pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG pipeline effectively handles structured data in technical documents, improving retrieval and question-answering performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

*Siyuan Li,Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) for Knowledge Graph Completion, combining static and dynamic methods to better model relational semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding-based KGC methods lack contextual and dynamic relational modeling, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: FMS uses a semantic context learning module and a conditional flow-matching module to dynamically refine static scores.

Result: FMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: FMS enhances KGC by integrating context-aware static and dynamic relational modeling.

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark for Deep Search evaluates RAG systems using synthetic data simulating business workflows, revealing retrieval as the main bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic benchmarks for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios.

Method: Built a synthetic data pipeline simulating business workflows, generating interconnected content with noise and multi-hop questions.

Result: Best-performing RAG methods scored 32.96 on the benchmark, with retrieval identified as the primary bottleneck.

Conclusion: Existing RAG methods struggle with deep searches, leading to performance degradation due to partial context retrieval.

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

*Dingzriui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS) metric to evaluate in-context learning (ICL) effectiveness in LLMs, addressing reliability, attribution, and data dependency issues of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL evaluation methods are unreliable, poorly attributed, and impractical in data-scarce settings, necessitating a better metric.

Method: Proposes LCS, which models the slope between learning gain and contextual relevance to quantify ICL effectiveness.

Result: LCS correlates strongly with performance improvements, works in biased/data-scarce scenarios, and reveals actionable thresholds.

Conclusion: LCS is a reliable, practical metric for assessing ICL effectiveness, offering insights into model capabilities and failure modes.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

TL;DR: The paper introduces V-Synthesis, a method for synthesizing demonstrations from scratch for arbitrary tasks in in-context learning, using a novel consistency metric called V-Score to improve performance and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High labeling costs for in-context learning demonstrations and the limitations of existing synthesis methods, which are task-specific or rely on pre-existing demonstrations, motivate the need for a more flexible and efficient approach.

Method: The paper proposes V-Score, a consistency metric, and V-Synthesis, a method that uses V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure high consistency and diversity in synthesized demonstrations.

Result: V-Synthesis achieves an average performance improvement of 2.0% over existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: V-Synthesis is a promising approach for synthesizing demonstrations from scratch, addressing consistency and diversity challenges in in-context learning.

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

*Gabriel Iturra-Bocaz,Felipe Bravo-Marquez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiverText is a Python library for training and evaluating incremental word embeddings from text data streams, addressing the static nature of traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional word embeddings are static and struggle with evolving language patterns, especially in dynamic sources like social media.

Method: The library implements incremental techniques (Skip-gram, CBOW, Word Context Matrix) using PyTorch and adapts evaluation tasks for streaming.

Result: The paper compares methods with various hyperparameters and discusses their performance in streaming scenarios.

Conclusion: RiverText provides a standardized framework for incremental word embeddings, aiding NLP and IR tasks in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is
available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that LLMs inherently contain a latent reward model, equivalent to inverse reinforcement learning, eliminating the need for costly human preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bypass the high cost of human preference data for aligning LLMs and provide a theoretical foundation for AI feedback methods.

Method: Proves the existence of a latent reward model in LLMs via next-token prediction, equivalent to offline inverse reinforcement learning, and uses it for reinforcement learning.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, including trained reward models, with a provable error bound.

Conclusion: Suggests replacing reward modeling with eliciting pre-trained knowledge, offering a more efficient and scalable alignment paradigm for LLMs and multi-modal models.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two new spelling normalization approaches using large language models, comparing unsupervised training and machine translation. Machine translation performs better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical documents lack standardized spelling, posing challenges for scholars. Spelling normalization aims to align orthography with modern standards.

Method: Two approaches: one using unsupervised training and another using machine translation. Evaluated on diverse datasets.

Result: Both methods showed promise, but machine translation was more effective for spelling normalization.

Conclusion: Statistical machine translation is the most suitable technology for spelling normalization in historical documents.

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

*P. Myles Eugenio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling using emergent learning and hierarchical Hopfield memory, enabling unsupervised tokenization and synthetic language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how symbolic structure can emerge from local neural learning without predefined tokens or supervision, advancing scalable and interpretable neuro-symbolic systems.

Method: Uses a hierarchical Hopfield memory chain for compositional short-term memory and dynamic tokenization, learning symbol sequences as multi-scale representations and binding co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens.

Result: The model filters natural language patterns from noise, generates synthetic languages with coherent morphology, and generalizes beyond initial inference class without explicit data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems, advancing neuromorphic architectures for generative language models.

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

*Shouvon Sarker,Xishuang Dong,Lijun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a BERT-based ensemble model for detecting and classifying medication events from clinical notes, improving performance metrics significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying key variables like medications and diseases from clinical data, leveraging NLP for EHR analytics.

Method: Pretrained BERT models on Wikipedia and MIMIC data, fine-tuned on CMED, and integrated predictions using voting strategies.

Result: Improved strict Micro-F score by ~5% and strict Macro-F score by ~6%.

Conclusion: BERT-based ensemble models are effective for medication event classification in clinical notes.

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

*Yumeng Lin,Xufeng Duan,David Haslett,Yige Chen,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how training data, language proximity, and family affect multilingual translation in GPT-4 and Llama 2, revealing that data size and linguistic closeness to English impact quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand challenges in multilingual translation, especially for low-resource or linguistically distant languages.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4 and Llama 2 using round-trip translations, assessed with BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics.

Result: Training data size and language distance interact: abundant data helps, but closer languages to English perform better in low-resource settings. Orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances predict performance.

Conclusion: Translation quality depends on data volume and structural/typological language relationships, highlighting linguistic constraints in multilingual models.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATGen is a framework integrating active learning (AL) with text generation (NLG), reducing annotation effort and costs by leveraging human annotators and LLMs like ChatGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AL's success in reducing annotation effort, its application to NLG tasks has been limited. ATGen aims to bridge this gap.

Method: ATGen combines AL strategies with NLG tasks, supporting both human annotators and LLM-based automatic annotation (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude). It provides a unified platform for implementation and benchmarking.

Result: ATGen reduces human annotation effort and LLM API costs, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse NLG tasks.

Conclusion: ATGen successfully integrates AL with NLG, offering a practical and cost-efficient solution for text generation tasks.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perspective-Dial, a method to quantify and control bias and perspective in LLM outputs using a metric space and systematic prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of quantifiable understanding of bias and perspective in LLM outputs, which are increasingly used in critical roles.

Method: Perspective-Dial uses a metric space (Perspective Space) for measuring perspectives and Systematic Prompt Engineering with greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM outputs.

Result: The approach empirically quantifies and adjusts LLM outputs for various topics without needing a deep theoretical understanding of bias.

Conclusion: Perspective-Dial enables applications like bias detection, narrative tracking, and debate bots by controlling LLM perspectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Memory Organization-based Generation (MOG) framework for autonomously generating Wikipedia articles by organizing fine-grained memory units hierarchically, improving informativeness and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of integrating accurate and structured information from diverse sources for Wikipedia article generation.

Method: MOG uses a hierarchical memory architecture to extract and organize memory units, guiding generation and linking sentences to sources for traceability.

Result: MOG outperforms baselines on the WikiStart dataset, producing more reliable and informative articles.

Conclusion: MOG is effective for real-world Wikipedia article generation, minimizing hallucinations and enhancing verifiability.

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews fairness datasets in language model research, introduces a unified evaluation framework, and highlights biases in benchmarks to guide better dataset selection and interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scrutiny on fairness datasets used in language model benchmarks and their potential biases.

Method: A broad review of widely used fairness datasets, characterization along key dimensions, and introduction of a unified evaluation framework.

Result: Revealed consistent demographic disparities across datasets and scoring methods, highlighting overlooked biases.

Conclusion: Offers guidance for dataset selection and interpretation, advocating for more diverse benchmarks and thoughtful use.

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

### [320] [TuCo: Measuring the Contribution of Fine-Tuning to Individual Responses of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23423)
*Felipe Nuti,Tim Franzmeyer,João Henriques*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tuning Contribution (TuCo), a method to quantify fine-tuning's impact on individual LLM outputs by analyzing hidden states and decomposing models into pre-training and fine-tuning components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic method for analyzing fine-tuning's effect on individual LLM outputs, beyond overall task performance.

Method: Proposes TuCo, which tracks hidden states and decomposes models into pre-training and fine-tuning components, allowing scaling of the fine-tuning effect during inference.

Result: TuCo reveals that adversarial attacks reduce fine-tuning's influence, and successful attacks correlate with lower TuCo values.

Conclusion: TuCo provides a quantitative tool to study fine-tuning's role in LLM behavior and safety, showing its potential for understanding and mitigating adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

*Zixian Huang,Chenxu Niu,Yu Gu,Gengyang Xiao,Xinwei Huang,Gong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new pipelined decoder architecture is proposed to enable parallel text generation in autoregressive models, improving speed without compromising quality or memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models generate tokens sequentially, creating a speed bottleneck. The goal is to enable parallelism while maintaining quality.

Method: The pipelined decoder generates multiple subsequences simultaneously, producing a new token for each subsequence at each time-step.

Result: Experiments show significant speed improvements in tasks like question answering and summarization, with no major quality loss or extra memory cost.

Conclusion: The pipelined decoder effectively addresses the speed bottleneck in autoregressive models, enabling faster parallel generation.

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

TL;DR: ATF (Adaptive Table Filtering Framework) improves table-based reasoning by pruning uninformative columns and rows, reducing table cells by ~70% and enhancing performance on TableQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with large tables due to input length limits, necessitating a solution to filter uninformative data.

Method: ATF uses LLM-generated column descriptions, clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores to prune columns and rows, integrating with existing models without retraining.

Result: ATF reduces table cells by ~70%, improving TableQA performance but slightly dropping Table Fact Verification performance where full-table context is critical.

Conclusion: ATF effectively balances informativeness and minimalism, adapting to different table-based reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

TL;DR: TAIRA is a novel LLM-powered multi-agent system for interactive recommendations, addressing complex user intents via thought-augmentation and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-powered recommender agents struggle with diverse and complex user intents due to limited planning and generalization.

Method: TAIRA uses a manager agent with Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD) to decompose user needs and plan subtasks, alongside user simulation for evaluation.

Result: TAIRA significantly outperforms existing methods, especially on challenging tasks, and generalizes well on novel tasks.

Conclusion: TAIRA effectively manages complex user intents in interactive recommendation systems, validated by comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

TL;DR: SFT and RFT are compared for adapting multimodal models. SFT learns quickly but forgets prior knowledge, while RFT learns slower but retains knowledge. Data distribution is key to forgetting, and RFT shows promise for stable continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how SFT and RFT impact prior knowledge in multimodal models when adapting to new tasks.

Method: Introduces jigsaw puzzles as a novel task, tests SFT and RFT on Qwen2.5-VL, and analyzes learning dynamics.

Result: SFT causes catastrophic forgetting but learns fast; RFT retains knowledge but learns slower. RFT-simulated rollouts help SFT preserve knowledge.

Conclusion: Data distribution drives forgetting, and RFT is effective for stable continual learning in multimodal models.

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

Conclusion: NEU-ESC fills a gap in Vietnamese educational datasets; multitask BERT performs well. Dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: In the field of education, understanding students' opinions through their
comments is crucial, especially in the Vietnamese language, where resources
remain limited. Existing educational datasets often lack domain relevance and
student slang. To address these gaps, we introduce NEU-ESC, a new Vietnamese
dataset for Educational Sentiment Classification and Topic Classification,
curated from university forums, which offers more samples, richer class
diversity, longer texts, and broader vocabulary. In addition, we explore
multitask learning using encoder-only language models (BERT), in which we
showed that it achieves performance up to 83.7% and 79.8% accuracy for
sentiment and topic classification tasks. We also benchmark our dataset and

TL;DR: The paper analyzes memorization, creativity, and nonsense in LLM-generated cooking recipes using human judgments and an automated 'LLM-as-judge' pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs balance memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated content, and to scale this analysis beyond small samples.

Method: Human annotation of 20 LLM-generated recipes for memorization, creativity, and nonsense, followed by an automated pipeline (LLM-as-judge) for large-scale analysis.

Result: Mixtral relies heavily on memorized content. The automated pipeline, using Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieves 78% accuracy in ingredient matching.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable framework to quantify memorization, creativity, and nonsense in LLM outputs, revealing their creative limitations.

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

TL;DR: SemDiD improves semantic diversity in language model outputs by operating in embedding space, outperforming existing methods in quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for diverse decoding in language models achieve lexical but not semantic diversity, limiting applications like Best-of-N strategies and reinforcement learning.

Method: SemDiD uses orthogonal directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased probability assessment in embedding space, balanced via adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization.

Result: SemDiD improves Best-of-N coverage by 1.4-5.2%, accelerates RLHF training convergence by 15%, and increases accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Conclusion: SemDiD effectively balances quality and semantic diversity, outperforming current methods in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate synthetic behavioral data, but their ability to replicate personality-driven psychological differences is mixed. Some traits like Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are reliably replicated, while others show biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can faithfully simulate personality-based behavioral differences, specifically in susceptibility to misinformation.

Method: LLM agents were conditioned on Big-Five personality profiles and compared to human data on news discernment (judging headline accuracy).

Result: Some trait-misinformation associations (e.g., Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) were replicated, but others diverged, revealing LLM biases.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for behavioral simulation but have limits in replicating cognitive diversity, highlighting biases in their personality modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

*Arnisa Fazla,Lucas Krauter,David Guzman Piedrahita,Andrianos Michail*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extended BeamAttack for adversarial text attacks with word deletions and LIME integration, achieving high success rates while preserving text similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness evaluation of text classification systems by discovering minimal adversarial modifications.

Method: Extended BeamAttack with word deletions, optional substitutions, and LIME for word prioritization, tested on BiLSTM, BERT, and RoBERTa.

Result: Over 99% attack success rate while maintaining semantic and lexical similarity.

Conclusion: BeamAttack is effective but has limitations; implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's
effectiveness and its limitations. Our implementation is available at

### [330] [Zero-Shot Contextual Embeddings via Offline Synthetic Corpus Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23662)
*Philip Lippmann,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZEST is a zero-shot framework for contextual adaptation in embeddings, using synthetic proxy corpora to avoid real corpus access or finetuning, achieving near-full-corpus performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings where accessing target corpora or finetuning is impractical.

Method: Multi-step hierarchical synthesis of a compact proxy corpus from exemplar documents to emulate domain-specific distributions, used by a frozen encoder for domain-adapted embeddings.

Result: ZEST performs within 0.5% of models with full corpus access on the MTEB benchmark, using only five example documents.

Conclusion: ZEST enables high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments without retraining or corpus access.

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: L-Zero (L0) is a scalable, end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents, improving LLM performance on multi-turn tasks via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scalability and training efficiency challenges in training LLMs for autonomous, multi-turn tasks.

Method: Introduces L0 with a low-cost, sandboxed agent worker pool and NB-Agent scaffold using "code-as-action" via REPL. Evaluated on factuality benchmarks.

Result: Boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30% to 80% and HotpotQA from 22% to 41% using RLVR.

Conclusion: L0 is effective for training robust agents, with open-sourced resources for broader application.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training
recipes on (https://github.com/cmriat/l0).

### [332] [AutoEvoEval: An Automated Framework for Evolving Close-Ended LLM Evaluation Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23735)
*JiaRu Wu,Mingwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval is an evolution-based framework for evaluating LLMs on close-ended tasks, introducing 22 atomic operations to generate diverse and challenging test samples, revealing significant accuracy drops and model sensitivities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs are static and lack systematic control over perturbations, limiting robustness assessment. AutoEvoEval aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes AutoEvoEval with 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and multi-round compositions to generate diverse test samples. Evaluates on various LLMs.

Result: Atomic operations cause a 7.283% accuracy drop, with structure-disrupting edits being most impactful. Multi-step perturbations amplify adversarial effects by up to 52.932%.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks may overestimate LLM generalization. AutoEvoEval highlights the need for evolution-aware robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

### [333] [Positional Bias in Binary Question Answering: How Uncertainty Shapes Model Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23743)
*Tiziano Labruna,Simone Gallo,Giovanni Da San Martino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study quantifies positional bias in binary question answering across five large language models, showing it grows exponentially with uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how model choices are influenced by the order of options in binary question answering, especially under varying uncertainty levels.

Method: Adapted the SQuAD-it dataset with incorrect options and created versions with less context. Evaluated WebGPT and Winning Arguments benchmarks, flipping correct option order to measure bias.

Result: Positional bias is minimal in low-uncertainty conditions but increases significantly when uncertainty rises.

Conclusion: Positional bias in models escalates with answer uncertainty, highlighting a need for bias mitigation in uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

### [334] [Do Thinking Tokens Help or Trap? Towards More Efficient Large Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23840)
*Bowen Ding,Yuhan Chen,Futing Wang,Lingfeng Ming,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DuP-PO improves token efficiency in Large Reasoning Models by reducing unnecessary thinking tokens, enhancing performance on simple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often overthink simple tasks, producing verbose responses with unnecessary thinking tokens, reducing efficiency.

Method: Proposes Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO) with rollout sampling, advantage control, and policy shaping to regulate thinking tokens.

Result: DuP-PO improves token efficiency and maintains superior performance on five math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DuP-PO effectively mitigates the thinking trap in LRMs, enhancing efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

*Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Edoardo Cecchinato,Lucia Hornikova,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper audits three reasoning benchmarks (SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, ToMi), revealing flaws in design and evaluation. LLMs' high scores often stem from format alignment, not reasoning, challenging benchmark validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address flaws in widely used reasoning benchmarks and their evaluation methods, ensuring accurate assessment of LLM reasoning.

Method: Systematic audit using five LLMs (GPT-3, 3.5, 4, o1, LLaMA 3.1) and human annotation to detect benchmark issues and re-evaluate cleaned subsets.

Result: Benchmarks contain structural, semantic, and pragmatic flaws. Model performance is sensitive to input variations, with scores often reflecting format alignment, not reasoning.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks may misrepresent LLM reasoning. The study calls for evaluation protocols focusing on inference processes and releases audited data/tools for better assessments.

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

*André de Souza Loureiro,Jorge Valverde-Rebaza,Julieta Noguez,David Escarcega,Ricardo Marcacini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPS framework enhances multi-step reasoning in LLMs by combining CoT, Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting, outperforming standard methods while balancing cost and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks despite advancements.

Method: MAPS integrates CoT, Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting in an iterative refinement process.

Result: MAPS outperforms standard CoT and matches specialized reasoning models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: MAPS improves reasoning in general-purpose LLMs but requires balancing reflection depth for cost efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

### [337] [The Trilemma of Truth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23921)
*Germans Savcisens,Tina Eliassi-Rad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces sAwMIL, a method to assess the veracity of LLMs' internal knowledge, revealing insights about truth signals and probing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address flawed assumptions in existing methods for evaluating LLM knowledge and provide a reliable way to verify their probabilistic internal knowledge.

Method: Introduces sAwMIL, a probing method using internal activations of LLMs, based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. Evaluated on 16 LLMs and 3 datasets.

Result: Found concentrated veracity signals in LLM depth, asymmetric truth/falsehood signals, and varying probe performance across models.

Conclusion: sAwMIL reliably verifies LLM knowledge, revealing distinct signals and improving understanding of their probabilistic knowledge.

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

*Mohammed J. Saeed,Tommi Vehvilainen,Evgeny Fedoseev,Sevil Caliskan,Tatiana Vodolazova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IMPACT is a synthetic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' understanding of inflectional morphology in five morphologically rich languages, revealing gaps in their linguistic complexity handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs truly grasp the linguistic complexity of non-English languages, particularly in morphology, despite their fluent outputs.

Method: Introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated framework with unit-test-style cases for evaluating LLMs across Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew, covering shared and language-specific morphological phenomena.

Result: Eight multilingual LLMs struggle with non-English languages and uncommon morphological patterns, especially in judging ungrammatical examples, and performance degrades with Chain of Thought and Thinking Models.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant gaps in handling linguistic complexity, highlighting room for improvement, and the IMPACT framework is released to support further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

*Ruhina Tabasshum Prome,Tarikul Islam Tamiti,Anomadarshi Barua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores prompt engineering on LLMs for hate speech detection in low-resource languages, introducing innovative metaphor prompting and evaluating six strategies on Llama2-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large-scale datasets for hate speech detection in low-resource languages like Bengali, and overcoming LLM safety mechanisms.

Method: Six prompting strategies (zero-shot, refusal suppression, flattering, multi-shot, role, metaphor) tested on Llama2-7B, compared with word embeddings (GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText) and deep learning models (MLP, CNN, BiGRU).

Result: Metaphor prompting proves effective, outperforming other methods in low-resource languages (Bengali, Hindi) and high-resource languages (English, German), measured by F1 score and environmental impact.

Conclusion: Metaphor prompting is a novel, effective solution for hate speech detection in low-resource languages, with broader applicability and minimal environmental impact.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fragmentation of knowledge in domain-specific MLLMs and improving their adaptability to diverse data inputs.

Method: Proposes Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) for selective parameter fusion, leveraging local and global signals, and introduces a domain compatibility scoring mechanism.

Result: Validated effectiveness across diverse multimodal benchmarks, enabling scalable, domain-adaptive MLLMs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates heterogeneous expertise while preserving modularity, offering a scalable solution for MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore SAE-based explainability in sentence classification, a less-studied domain, and enhance interpretability of LLM features.

Method: A novel SAE-based architecture with a specialized classifier head and activation rate sparsity loss, benchmarked against ConceptShap, ICA, and other SAE techniques.

Result: Improved causality and interpretability of extracted features, validated on two benchmarks and four Pythia LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed SAE architecture effectively enhances interpretability and causality in sentence classification tasks.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large
Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal
representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

TL;DR: The TaP framework automates the creation of high-quality, multilingual preference datasets for fine-tuning LLMs, outperforming larger open-source datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the resource-intensive and English-centric nature of existing datasets for fine-tuning LLMs.

Method: Proposes the TaP framework, using a structured taxonomy for automated, scalable dataset generation across languages.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned with TaP datasets outperform those using larger open-source datasets.

Conclusion: TaP enables efficient, high-quality dataset generation, improving LLM performance across languages.

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the societal problem of identifying the faithfulness of scientific texts due to the increasing volume of potentially misinformative content online.

Method: The thesis contributes methods and resources in three areas: automatic fact-checking, learning with limited data, and scientific text processing, including adversarial claim generation and zero-shot fact-checking.

scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

*Seungjun Yi,Joakim Nguyen,Huimin Xu,Terence Lim,Andrew Well,Mia Markey,Ying Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated LLM pipeline for thematic analysis of clinical narratives in CHD, reducing manual effort and improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional thematic analysis of CHD narratives is labor-intensive and unscalable.

Method: A multi-agent LLM framework with optional RLHF for automated thematic analysis.

Result: Enables scalable, patient-centered analysis of qualitative data with high thematic relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers efficient, context-aware thematic analysis for clinical narratives.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs like ChatGPT excel at solving mathematical word problems but lack deep understanding of real-world context, limiting their educational value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of LLMs in supporting mathematics education, particularly in solving word problems, and to evaluate their real-world contextual understanding.

Method: A scoping review with three parts: technical overview, systematic literature review of word-problem corpora, and empirical evaluation of LLMs on word problems.

Result: LLMs perform well on s-problems (superficial tasks) but struggle with real-world context, scoring near-perfect on PISA problems but failing in non-sensical contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs master superficial problem-solving but lack deep understanding, limiting their usefulness as instructional tools in math education.

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

### [346] [EXPERT: An Explainable Image Captioning Evaluation Metric with Structured Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24016)
*Hyunjong Kim,Sangyeop Kim,Jongheon Jeong,Yeongjae Cho,Sungzoon Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EXPERT is a new reference-free metric for image captioning evaluation, providing structured explanations based on fluency, relevance, and descriptiveness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable metrics lack standardized criteria and verified explanation quality, prompting the need for a more reliable evaluation tool.

Method: EXPERT uses a two-stage evaluation template and large-scale datasets to train a vision-language model for scoring and explanation generation.

Result: EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and produces higher-quality explanations, validated by human evaluation.

Conclusion: EXPERT offers a robust, explainable metric for image captioning, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

*Ian R. McKenzie,Oskar J. Hollinsworth,Tom Tseng,Xander Davies,Stephen Casper,Aaron D. Tucker,Robert Kirk,Adam Gleave*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI defense pipelines, introduces a novel classifier outperforming existing safeguards, and demonstrates vulnerabilities through a staged attack method (STACK), suggesting mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear security of AI defense pipelines and the lack of prior evaluation or attacks on them.

Method: Developed an open-source defense pipeline, tested a few-shot-prompted classifier, and introduced the STACK attack procedure to evaluate vulnerabilities.

Result: The novel classifier reduced attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on ClearHarm, but STACK achieved 71% ASR in black-box and 33% in transfer settings.

Conclusion: AI defense pipelines are vulnerable to staged attacks, and specific mitigations are needed to enhance security.

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

### [348] [On the Predictive Power of Representation Dispersion in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24106)
*Yanhong Li,Ming Li,Karen Livescu,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models with wider embedding spaces (higher representation dispersion) achieve lower perplexity, and this dispersion can be used for practical tasks like model selection and improving retrieval-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between embedding space breadth (dispersion) and language model performance (perplexity), and to explore practical applications of dispersion.

Method: Analyze representation dispersion (average pairwise cosine distance) across models (LLaMA, Qwen) and domains (Wikipedia, news, scientific abstracts). Use dispersion for tasks like predicting downstream accuracy, optimizing retrieval layers, and enhancing training with a push-away objective.

Result: Higher dispersion strongly correlates with lower perplexity. Dispersion aids in model selection, identifies optimal layers for retrieval, and improves perplexity when integrated into training.

Conclusion: Representation dispersion is a key factor in language model performance and offers practical benefits for model evaluation and optimization.

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

*David M. Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates transformer-based models (E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, LaBSE) for detecting parallel passages in the Hebrew Bible, finding E5 and AlephBERT most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual comparison of biblical Hebrew passages is labor-intensive and error-prone, prompting the need for automated methods.

Method: The study tested pre-trained models (E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, LaBSE) using cosine similarity and Wasserstein Distance on known parallels between Samuel/Kings and Chronicles.

Result: E5 excelled in detecting parallels, while AlephBERT better differentiated non-parallel passages.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models can improve efficiency and accuracy in detecting intertextual parallels, with potential for broader ancient language studies.

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

*Lei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a TDWLFT model to improve spatiotemporal traffic data imputation by reducing outlier sensitivity with a threshold distance weighted loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete or corrupted traffic data due to communication failures and sensor malfunctions hinder ITS performance. Existing LFT models are vulnerable to outliers.

Method: Introduces a TDW loss-incorporated LFT (TDWLFT) model, assigning differentiated weights to samples to mitigate outlier effects.

Result: TDWLFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency on two traffic speed datasets.

Conclusion: The TDWLFT model effectively addresses outlier sensitivity in traffic data imputation, enhancing ITS performance.

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and
high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance.
Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as
communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or
corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of
ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,
the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted
and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the
standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to
the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of
Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the
model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to
individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed
datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed
TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores reproducing knowledge-based structured thinking in deep learning models using feature-grounded embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align deep learning models with human-like reasoning by incorporating conceptual features from prior knowledge.

Method: Introduces feature-grounded embeddings to map shareable representations to domain-specific conceptual features.

Result: Aims to create interpretable and operable embeddings that reflect human conceptual categories.

Conclusion: Proposes a method to enhance deep learning models with structured, knowledge-based reasoning.

Abstract: In everyday reasoning, when we think about a particular object, we associate
it with a unique set of expected properties such as weight, size, or more
abstract attributes like density or horsepower. These expectations are shaped
by our prior knowledge and the conceptual categories we have formed through
experience. This paper investigates how such knowledge-based structured
thinking can be reproduced in deep learning models using features based
embeddings. Specially, it introduces an specific approach to build
feature-grounded embedding, aiming to align shareable representations of
operable dictionary with interpretable domain-specific conceptual features.

TL;DR: RL-Net, a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network, balances interpretability and performance in hand gesture recognition, outperforming transparent and black-box models while reducing rule complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable rule-based models and high-performing deep neural networks in complex tasks like radar-based hand gesture recognition.

Method: RL-Net learns interpretable rule lists via neural optimization, benchmarked against MIRA (rule-based) and XentricAI (explainable black-box). Evaluated on accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability.

Result: RL-Net achieves 93.03% F1 score, reduces rule complexity, and addresses optimization challenges like rule pruning and hierarchy bias.

Conclusion: RL-Net is a practical middle ground for interpretable HGR, demonstrating the feasibility of neuro-symbolic models and insights for edge-deployable explainable AI.

Abstract: Rule-based models offer interpretability but struggle with complex data,
while deep neural networks excel in performance yet lack transparency. This
work investigates a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network named RL-Net
that learns interpretable rule lists through neural optimization, applied for
the first time to radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). We benchmark
RL-Net against a fully transparent rule-based system (MIRA) and an explainable
black-box model (XentricAI), evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and user
adaptability via transfer learning. Our results show that RL-Net achieves a
favorable trade-off, maintaining strong performance (93.03% F1) while
significantly reducing rule complexity. We identify optimization challenges
specific to rule pruning and hierarchy bias and propose stability-enhancing
modifications. Compared to MIRA and XentricAI, RL-Net emerges as a practical
middle ground between transparency and performance. This study highlights the
real-world feasibility of neuro-symbolic models for interpretable HGR and
offers insights for extending explainable AI to edge-deployable sensing
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately identifying PASC progression events and clinical risks for better patient management and resource allocation.

Method: Uses a cohort with text time series features from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and clinical expert annotations, proposing an Active Attention Network for risk prediction and event identification.

Result: Aims to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and identify progression events with fewer annotations.

Conclusion: The approach seeks to improve patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Abstract: The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC,
pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate
identification of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection,
is essential for effective patient management and resource allocation. However,
traditional models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced
progression of PASC. In this study, we introduce the first publicly available
cohort of 18 PASC patients, with text time series features based on Large
Language Model Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and clinical risk annotated by clinical
expert. We propose an Active Attention Network to predict the clinical risk and
identify progression events related to the risk. By integrating human expertise
with active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and
enable progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The
ultimate goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2
patient.

*Saad Alqithami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAMARL, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to enhance cybersecurity in Cyber-Physical Systems by combining local and global defense strategies with adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security methods are inadequate against adaptive cyber threats in Cyber-Physical Systems, necessitating a more resilient approach.

Method: HAMARL uses a hierarchical structure with local agents and a global coordinator, plus adversarial training to simulate evolving threats.

Result: Experiments show HAMARL outperforms traditional methods, improving detection accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity.

Conclusion: Combining hierarchical multi-agent coordination with adversarial training effectively enhances CPS resilience and security.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various
sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous
transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them
highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day
attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion
detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To
overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical
Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.
HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to
subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes
comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework
incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate
evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive
experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed
indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent
reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection
accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The
results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent
coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and
security of next-generation CPS.

*Aakash Tripathi,Asim Waqas,Matthew B. Schabath,Yasin Yilmaz,Ghulam Rasool*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGLE is a deep learning framework for cancer survival prediction, using attention-based multimodal fusion and interpretability methods to improve accuracy and clinical trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches for cancer survival prediction lack interpretability, computational efficiency, and effective fusion strategies, limiting clinical adoption.

Method: EAGLE employs dynamic cross-modal attention, dimensionality reduction, three attribution methods, and a unified pipeline for adaptability across cancer types.

Result: Tested on 911 patients with three cancers, EAGLE identified high-risk and low-risk groups with significant survival differences (4-5 fold), aiding treatment decisions.

Conclusion: EAGLE bridges AI and healthcare by offering scalable, interpretable, and accurate multimodal survival prediction, enhancing physician trust.

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data
modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical
parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer
from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack
of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE
(Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning
framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal
fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key
innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn
hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality
reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three
complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and
(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We
evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:
glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,
n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis
showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,
while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk
stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to
5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment
intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical
interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and
practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal
survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust
in automated predictions.

*Fabio Merizzi,Harilaos Loukos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-task Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture (1EMD) is proposed for multi-variable climate downscaling, outperforming single-variable models in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for climate downscaling focus on single variables, leading to inefficiencies and lack of cross-variable interaction.

Method: A ViT-based architecture with a shared encoder and variable-specific decoders jointly predicts three climate variables (tas, sfcWind, zg500) from GCM inputs.

Result: The multi-variable approach shows positive cross-variable knowledge transfer, outperforms single-variable baselines, and improves computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Multi-variable modeling is effective for high-resolution climate downscaling, offering better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate
dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in
regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic
downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited
flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven
alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that
downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual
awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our
study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and
variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts
three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),
and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,
emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable
approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently
outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while
also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate
downscaling.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively enhances stabilization with reduced computational resources.

Abstract: The stabilization of time series processes is a crucial problem that is
ubiquitous in various industrial fields. The application of machine learning to
its solution can have a decisive impact, improving both the quality of the
resulting stabilization with less computational resources required. In this
work, we present a simple pipeline consisting of two neural networks: the

successfully improves stability in terms of the temperature control by about 3
times compared to ordinary solvers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task-agnostic contrastive pretraining approach for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) to learn transferable representations from relational databases, outperforming task-specific supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RDL models rely on task-specific supervised learning, limiting scalability and reuse. The paper aims to enable database-wide representation learning.

Method: Proposes a contrastive pretraining approach with row-level, link-level, and context-level objectives, implemented via a modular RDL architecture and efficient sampling.

Result: Preliminary results show fine-tuning pretrained models outperforms training from scratch, validating transferable representation learning.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology shows promise for scalable and reusable RDL by learning transferable representations.

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph
Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by
representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models
typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training
separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and
reuse.
  In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining
approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that
aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level,
link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic
heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective
pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient
sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our
preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the
pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the
promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations
for relational data.

TL;DR: The paper explores how untrained deep neural policies implicitly shape exploration in RL, revealing non-trivial state-visitation distributions and correlated actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how policy architecture influences exploration in RL, especially in sparse or adversarial reward settings.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis using infinite-width networks and continuous-time limits in a toy model.

Result: Untrained policies produce correlated actions and non-trivial state-visitation distributions, offering insights into exploration biases.

Conclusion: Policy initialization can be a design tool to study early exploration behavior in RL.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In
this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly
shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from
untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks
and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated
actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss
the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard
architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling
exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for
using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior
in early training.

Method: Replaces the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator, proposing Mutual Information Optimization (MIO).

Result: MIO mitigates late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood and outperforms DPO in reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: MIO offers a competitive alternative to RLHF and DPO, with theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently
garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical
yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both
RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)
maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within
this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform
contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from
the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI
(equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may
not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is
already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the
DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual
Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage
decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior
performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

### [361] [Are Fast Methods Stable in Adversarially Robust Transfer Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22602)
*Joshua C. Zhao,Saurabh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGSM in adversarial fine-tuning is stable and computationally efficient, performing nearly as well as PGD with significantly less training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning in transfer learning while maintaining robustness.

Method: Revisiting FGSM for adversarial fine-tuning, testing its stability and performance compared to PGD.

Result: FGSM is stable, avoids catastrophic overfitting, and loses minimal robustness (0.39%-1.39%) compared to PGD while being 4x faster.

Conclusion: FGSM is a highly efficient and effective alternative to PGD for adversarial robustness in transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model
training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the
features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new
task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as
adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.
However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial
training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of
magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use
of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve
the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that
FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from
scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with
catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or
$\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for
linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance
across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used
method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%
and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using
$4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a
significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust
transfer learning but also a well-performing one.

*Paul Saves,Edward Hallé-Hannan,Jasper Bussemaker,Youssef Diouane,Nathalie Bartoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for handling hierarchical, conditional, and mixed-variable inputs in simulation-based problems, integrating surrogate modeling and optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data representation, modeling, and optimization for complex, structured input spaces with hierarchical and conditional dependencies.

Method: Proposes a framework with meta and partially-decreed variables, design space graphs, and hierarchical kernels for surrogate modeling and optimization.

Result: Implemented in SMT 2.0, demonstrated in Bayesian optimization for complex system design, including green aircraft architecture.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes existing approaches and efficiently handles complex hierarchical domains for modeling and optimization.

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature
domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured.
These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and
optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input
spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical.
A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other
decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical
structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose
activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable
hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining
principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition
of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system
architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such
domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient
modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the
open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are
demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system
design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-VAW-D, a hierarchical algorithm for online regression with RKHS, achieving optimal dynamic regret with adaptive discounting and random feature approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the DVAW forecaster to non-parametric domains and improve dynamic regret bounds in online regression.

Method: Proposes H-VAW-D, combining DVAW with random feature approximation, learning discount factors and feature numbers adaptively.

Result: Achieves $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} + \sqrt{T}\ln T)$ expected dynamic regret with $O(T\ln T)$ per-iteration complexity.

Conclusion: H-VAW-D efficiently adapts to non-parametric settings, balancing computational cost and regret performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic
loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a
discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic
regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to
the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random
feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm,
which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that
learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove
that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of
$O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} +
\sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator
sequence.

*Aadim Nepal,Safal Shrestha,Anubhav Shrestha,Minwu Kim,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training methods improve math reasoning in LLMs, but the layer importance structure remains unchanged. Critical layers for math tasks cause major accuracy drops if removed, unlike non-math tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if post-training improvements in math reasoning stem from major layer changes or minor adjustments, and to identify critical layers for such tasks.

Method: Layer-wise ablation experiments on base and post-trained models (instruction-tuned, knowledge-distilled, reinforcement learning) using math reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Math reasoning relies on specific, persistent layer structures; removing critical layers drops accuracy by up to 80%. Non-math tasks lack such critical layers.

Conclusion: Math reasoning requires specialized pre-trained layers, while non-reasoning tasks do not. Critical layers align with major representational transformations.

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning
capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement
learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these
improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor
adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base
model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic
layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,
knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise
to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across
all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up
to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no
critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires
specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning
tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that
these critical layers are the same layers where major representational
transformation occurs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning surrogates require large datasets, limiting real-world applicability. BayPOD-AL addresses this by reducing data needs.

Method: BayPOD-AL combines Bayesian proper orthogonal decomposition with active learning to select informative data points, minimizing training costs.

Result: BayPOD-AL effectively predicts temperature evolution in a rod and generalizes well to higher temporal resolution data.

Conclusion: BayPOD-AL offers a computationally efficient and generalizable solution for learning reduced-order models with limited data.

Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems
dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering
applications. To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods
rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in
real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning
framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order
models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems.
Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and
reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared
to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its
performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven method to learn stochastic multiscale models using stochastic differential equations, improving predictive accuracy over traditional simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamical systems in physical sciences often involve multiple scales, making direct numerical simulation computationally expensive.

Method: The approach learns multiscale models from data using a coarse mesh and an auxiliary state for unresolved scales, employing forward-solver-free variational inference.

Result: The learned models outperform direct numerical simulation and closure-type models in predictive accuracy at equivalent resolution.

Conclusion: The method offers a computationally efficient and accurate alternative for modeling multiscale dynamical systems.

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the
resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant
computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires
discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional
state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic
multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly
from observational data. Our method resolves the state on a coarse mesh while
introducing an auxiliary state to capture the effects of unresolved scales. We
learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a modern forward-solver-free
amortized variational inference method. Our approach draws inspiration from
physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, such as large-eddy simulation in
fluid dynamics, while learning directly from data. We present numerical studies
to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive
accuracy compared to direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at
equivalent resolution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistShap is a parallel algorithm for efficiently explaining GNN predictions by distributing Shapley value computations across multiple GPUs, scaling to models with millions of features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining GNN predictions is crucial but computationally expensive, especially for large graphs with millions of edges.

Method: DistShap distributes Shapley value-based explanations by sampling subgraphs, parallelizing GNN inference, and solving a distributed least squares problem.

Result: DistShap outperforms existing methods in accuracy and scales to GNNs with millions of features using up to 128 GPUs.

Conclusion: DistShap provides an efficient and scalable solution for explaining GNN predictions, addressing computational challenges in large-scale graphs.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their
predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions
to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example,
classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve
identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel
algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple
GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting,
executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed
least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms
most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to
GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC
Perlmutter supercomputer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the semantic collapsing problem in generative personalization, where learned visual concepts drift from their original meaning, simplifying outputs. A training-free method adjusts embedding magnitude and direction to mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semantic collapsing problem reduces the richness of multi-concept prompts, leading to oversimplified outputs. The goal is to preserve semantic alignment in generative personalization.

Method: A training-free approach adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained embeddings during inference to prevent semantic drift.

Result: The method effectively mitigates semantic collapsing, improving text-image alignment across diverse use cases.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is simple, effective, and broadly applicable, enhancing the fidelity of generative personalization outputs.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative
personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept
($V^*$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to
dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only
reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V^*$
wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms
such as "a photo of $V^*$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail
to capture the intended concept.
  We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the
learned embedding $V^*$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in
direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained
embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing
problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization
methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in
diverse use cases. Our code is anonymously published at

*Brian Mak,Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Residual Matrix Transformer (RMT), replacing the transformer's residual stream with an outer product memory matrix, achieving better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and performance of transformers by modifying the residual stream mechanism for storing and retrieving information.

Method: Replaces the transformer's residual stream with an outer product memory matrix, creating the RMT model.

Result: RMT scales residual stream independently, reduces FLOPS (58%), parameters (25%), and training tokens (41%), and outperforms transformers on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: RMT offers efficient scaling and improved performance, making it a promising alternative to traditional transformers.

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

*Shrenik Jadhav,Birva Sevak,Srijita Das,Akhtar Hussain,Wencong Su,Van-Hai Bui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairMarket-RL combines LLMs and RL to ensure fairness in P2P trading, achieving high fairness scores and equitable outcomes in decentralized energy systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing P2P trading lacks robust fairness frameworks, necessitating a scalable, adaptive solution.

Method: Uses LLMs as fairness critics with FTB and FBS metrics, integrated into RL rewards via IPPO training.

Result: Achieves >90% buyer demand fulfillment, fair seller margins, and FTB/FBS scores >0.80.

Conclusion: FairMarket-RL provides a scalable, equity-driven solution for decentralized trading.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for
decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust
frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel
hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P
microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time
fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:
Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness
scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled
{\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that
replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using
Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,
fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and
consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process
demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer
shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its
language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a
large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its
practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven
solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for analyzing symmetries in neural network loss landscapes, enabling discovery of low- and zero-loss paths between models like Vision Transformers and GPT-2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior work in capturing rich symmetries in modern architectures and to better understand model space geometry.

Method: Proposes a framework covering four symmetry classes: permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and invertible maps.

Result: Enables discovery of low- and zero-barrier paths between independently trained models, revealing deeper loss landscape structure.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for understanding neural network loss landscapes.

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central
question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and
optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where
independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths,
despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often
obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations --
which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has
predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such
approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries
exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we
introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes:
permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general
invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and
subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this
generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and
zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision
Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the
loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for
understanding model space geometry.

TL;DR: BEST-Route is a novel LLM query routing framework that dynamically selects models and response counts to balance cost and quality, achieving significant cost savings with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of deploying large language models (LLMs) at scale by optimizing query routing to balance cost and quality.

Method: Proposes BEST-Route, which selects models and response counts based on query difficulty and quality thresholds, leveraging multiple responses from smaller models to enhance quality.

Result: Reduces costs by up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: BEST-Route effectively optimizes LLM deployment costs while maintaining high performance, offering a scalable solution for query routing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RTC-GTNLN, a robust tensor completion model using a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate (L1-L2 norm) to handle missing values and noise in traffic data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world traffic data suffers from missing values and noise due to sensor and communication issues, requiring reliable recovery methods for downstream applications.

Method: Proposes RTC-GTNLN, integrating a gradient tensor L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework to exploit global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameters.

Result: RTC-GTNLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering traffic data with simultaneous missing values and noise, as shown in experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RTC-GTNLN effectively addresses dual degradation challenges in traffic data, offering superior performance in complex recovery scenarios.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences
dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions
and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are
essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.
while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are
incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios
involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust
Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately
modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is
often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the
suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model
accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2
norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective
low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,
we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor
L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear
L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via
Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully
exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off
parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of
missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on
multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery
scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an INT8 quantized training method using the Forward-Forward algorithm, achieving faster training, energy savings, and reduced memory usage on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation's inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its use for edge devices. Low-precision quantization for training is underexplored, and the Forward-Forward algorithm offers a promising alternative.

Method: The paper combines INT8 quantization with the Forward-Forward algorithm, introducing a 'look-ahead' scheme to stabilize gradients and improve accuracy.

Result: Experiments show 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, 27.0% memory reduction, and competitive accuracy on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient for resource-constrained edge devices, balancing speed, energy, and accuracy.

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for
decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its
suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural
network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model
inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the
Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to
backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass.
By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF
can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This
paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's
layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve
model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board
demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in
memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: Score-based diffusion models enable zero-shot conditioning and Bayesian updates for data fusion, applied here to super-resolution of high-dimensional dynamical systems using sparse, multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage score-based diffusion models for real-time data fusion and super-resolution tasks, addressing the challenge of high-dimensional state recovery from sparse, low-fidelity measurements.

Method: Uses score-based diffusion modeling to learn the gradient of log-probability density, reversing a noising process for sample generation and conditioning on observed data. Applied to ERA5 and IGRA datasets for super-resolution.

Result: Accurate recovery of high-dimensional states from sparse observations, with the model balancing influence from multiple data modalities during reconstructions.

Conclusion: Score-based diffusion models offer a promising approach for data fusion and super-resolution, effectively handling multimodal, sparse data in high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm
that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by
learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of
the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained,
score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable
zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises
a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned
distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given
the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we
apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical
system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally
observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis
on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also
provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that
generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a
coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental
observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery
of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity
measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the

### [376] [Riemannian-Geometric Fingerprints of Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22802)
*Hae Jin Song,Laurent Itti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometric framework using Riemannian geometry to define and analyze fingerprints of generative models, improving model attribution and distinguishing synthetic from human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable model authentication and differentiation of synthetic data due to IP protection, accountability, and the threat of model collapse.

Method: A geometric approach using Riemannian geometry to define artifacts and fingerprints, replacing Euclidean metrics with geodesic distances and Riemannian center of mass.

Result: The method effectively distinguishes various generative models across datasets, resolutions, architectures, and modalities, improving attribution and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a principled and practical solution for understanding and leveraging generative model fingerprints.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose transformer uncertainty methods lack task-specific guardrails, limiting their utility for downstream workflows.

Abstract: We propose BayesLoRA, a task-specific uncertainty quantification framework
that integrates MC-Dropout into Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). Unlike
general-purpose transformer uncertainty methods, BayesLoRA provides guardrails

LoRA adapters exhibit amplified variance outside fine-tuning distributions,

*Thomas Gaskin,Guy J. Abel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel dataset on global migration flows (1990-present) uses deep learning to estimate patterns, outperforming traditional methods with higher resolution and uncertainty bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive, high-resolution dataset on global migration flows and stocks, addressing gaps in existing data and methods.

Method: Deep recurrent neural networks trained on 18 covariates (geographic, economic, cultural, etc.) with ensemble learning for uncertainty bounds.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and temporal resolution, validated on unseen data. Includes open-source data and code.

Conclusion: The dataset and model offer a robust, open-source resource for migration research, highlighting regions needing more data.

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual
migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 43 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: xLSTMAD introduces the first anomaly detection method using xLSTM, excelling in accuracy on multivariate time series data and outperforming 23 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has not explored xLSTM for anomaly detection, despite its success in other tasks like forecasting and language modeling.

Method: Proposes xLSTMAD with encoder-decoder architecture, using forecasting (xLSTMAD-F) and reconstruction (xLSTMAD-R) variants, and evaluates MSE and SoftDTW loss functions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the TSB-AD-M benchmark, outperforming 23 baselines.

Conclusion: xLSTMAD demonstrates xLSTM's potential for anomaly detection, opening new research directions.

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive
multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity
needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This
architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless
compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear
memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to
Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM
for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the
first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM
architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder
processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is
devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,
the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the
reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded
counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider
local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We
evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17
real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.
In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23
popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the
powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way
for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are explored for wind turbine power output prediction, showing competitive or slightly better performance than classical methods, with insights on dataset size and circuit complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate QNNs' potential in predicting wind turbine power output, addressing the need for efficient machine learning in renewable energy systems.

Method: Six QNN configurations using Z Feature Map for data encoding and varying ansatz structures were tested via cross-validation and hold-out dataset experiments.

Result: QNNs achieved competitive or marginally better predictive performance than classical benchmarks, with performance influenced by dataset size and circuit complexity.

Conclusion: QNNs show promise for energy applications, offering valuable insights for integrating quantum machine learning into renewable energy research.

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML), are emerging as a powerful alternative to classical machine
learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to
various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification,
across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical
imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of
renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in
predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides
an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind
turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN
configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and
varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and
tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs
can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases
marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also
reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive
performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable
insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum
machine learning into their work.

*Shengcai Liu,Hui Ou-yang,Zhiyuan Wang,Cheng Chen,Qijun Cai,Yew-Soon Ong,Ke Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structure learning ensemble (SLE) approach to improve the accuracy and stability of learning large Bayesian networks (BNs), outperforming traditional divide-and-conquer methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning BN structures from large datasets is challenging due to instability in accuracy across subproblems.

Method: Proposes Auto-SLE, an automatic method for learning near-optimal SLEs, integrating them into divide-and-conquer strategies.

Result: Achieves 30%-225% accuracy improvement on datasets with 10,000 variables and generalizes well to larger datasets (e.g., 30,000 variables).

Conclusion: SLEs, especially when automatically learned, show significant potential for scalable BN structure learning.

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging,
especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently
proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&D) strategies present a promising approach for
learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning
accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing
structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure
learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further
propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs,
addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned
SLE is then integrated into a D\&D method. Extensive experiments firmly show
the superiority of our method over D\&D methods with single BN structure
learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement
usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore,
our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables
and different network characteristics than those present in the training data
for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of
employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) efficiently distributes models by transmitting low-bit precision versions and updates, optimizing accuracy, bandwidth, and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficient model distribution in bandwidth-constrained environments like federated learning, edge computing, and IoT.

Method: Transmits a lower-bit precision model with updates representing the difference to the high-precision version, tested on models of varying sizes and datasets.

Result: P$^2$U achieves a better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth, and latency, even with aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit).

Conclusion: P$^2$U is a practical solution for scalable model distribution, compatible with existing compression techniques.

Abstract: Efficient model distribution is becoming increasingly critical in
bandwidth-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this
problem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U
transmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing
the difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted
low precision version. With extensive experiments on various model
architectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a
large model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data
sets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U
consistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and
latency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,
aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising
performance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical
solution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource
settings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments.
Given that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be
implemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification,
quantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.

TL;DR: A novel sparse autoregression framework is proposed for interpretable periodicity quantification in time series, using ℓ0-norm sparsity and mixed-integer optimization (MIO) with a subspace pursuit strategy for scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability in time series autoregression models for capturing auto-correlations and temporal patterns like periodicity and seasonality.

Method: Proposes a sparse autoregression framework with ℓ0-norm constraints, reformulates it as MIO, and introduces a subspace pursuit strategy for efficiency. Extends to multidimensional time series with a two-stage optimization scheme.

Result: The MIO solver is accelerated without losing solution quality. Applied to ridesharing and climate data, it uncovers periodicities and dynamic patterns like El Nino.

Conclusion: The framework effectively quantifies periodicity, scales to large problems, and reveals interpretable temporal and spatial patterns in real-world data.

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing
auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and
seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework
from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model
interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm
induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we
reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization
problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a
subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the
search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated
spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying
sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by
developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme
makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision
variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the
MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while
maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the
time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover
both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity
of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly
seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and
precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover
dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea
surface temperature.

*Sina Tabakhi,Haiping Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGNET is a graph neural network that handles missing multimodal biological data by using a patient-modality attention mechanism and a patient graph, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of missing modalities in multimodal biological data, which current methods struggle with due to diverse missing patterns and scalability issues.

Method: Introduces MAGNET, which uses a multi-head attention mechanism to fuse modality embeddings and constructs a patient graph for predictions, scaling linearly with modalities.

Result: MAGNET outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods on multiomics cancer classification datasets with real-world missingness.

Conclusion: MAGNET effectively handles missing modalities and scales well, offering a robust solution for multimodal biological data analysis.

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing
modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients.
Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing
modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with
partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality
patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the
number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET
(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with
partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention
mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their
importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the
number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate
predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal
embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality
missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on
three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world
instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the
state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at

TL;DR: Infinite Sampling reduces memory overhead in GRPO for LLMs by decoupling group size from GPU memory, using micro sampling groups, continuous sampling, and a length-aware scheduler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory overhead and scalability issues in GRPO for LLMs due to large sample group sizes.

Method: Proposes Infinite Sampling with micro sampling groups, continuous sampling, and a length-aware scheduler combining token-conditioned prediction and two-stage planning.

Result: Reduces peak memory by 50% and improves throughput by 25% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Infinite Sampling enables efficient and stable GRPO training under GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Group Reward Policy
Optimization (GRPO) have proven effective for fine-tuning large language models
(LLMs) with human feedback. However, generating and storing multiple responses
per prompt incurs substantial memory overhead, especially as the sample group
size increases, limiting scalability under constrained hardware.
  We propose Infinite Sampling, a framework that enables efficient and stable
GRPO training by decoupling group size from GPU memory usage. It consists of:
(1) micro sampling groups that decompose large groups into memory-feasible
rounds; (2) continuous sampling that interleaves generation across groups to
improve utilization; and (3) a length-aware scheduler combining
token-conditioned sequence length prediction with a two-stage plan: global
grouping via FPTAS and runtime refill via SJF.
  Experiments show that our Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by
over 50% compared to full-group decoding (e.g., from 21.55 GB to 10.64 GB on
Qwen3-1.7B). Building on this, Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over
25% compared to the naive micro sampling group method, reducing decoding steps
while maintaining full-length completions and memory usage. Our hybrid
scheduling ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups under
realistic GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for
maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be
susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental
disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating
vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical
vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position,
speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized
machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns.
First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture
temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model
processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors.
Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by
offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and
performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746,
and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model
attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly

Motivation: The integration of renewable energy sources requires decentralized energy management solutions, with microgrids offering localized control.

Method: Proposes an RL agent for energy trading and storage, using a digital twin to simulate storage dynamics and degradation.

Result: The RL-based strategy outperforms rule-based and existing RL benchmarks in real-world tests.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust solution for intelligent microgrid management.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming
traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing
decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a
promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation,
storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management.
Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and
storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production,
consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the
energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a
realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through
an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the
Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy
outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust
solution for intelligent microgrid management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer) to address precision limitations in Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving PDEs, achieving near-machine-precision accuracy in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with machine-precision accuracy for PDEs, and the work investigates whether this is due to ill-conditioning of PDEs or MLP architecture limitations.

Method: The BWLer, a barycentric polynomial interpolation layer, is introduced to replace or augment MLPs, separating solution representation from PDE loss derivatives. Spectral derivatives and preconditioning are used for linear PDEs.

Result: BWLer improves RMSE significantly (up to 1800x) for benchmark PDEs and achieves near-machine-precision for some problems, outperforming standard PINNs.

Conclusion: BWLer combines PINN flexibility with classical solver precision, offering a practical path for high-accuracy PDE solutions.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still
fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand.
In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the
ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models
the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be
added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely
(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we
take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental
precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even
MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above
float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,
adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable
accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully
characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it
during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five
benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for
convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining
compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an
explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave
problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the
performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson
problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the
flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ternary language models (TriLMs) to address inference efficiency challenges in large language models (LLMs), proposing quantization-aware training, novel weight packing schemes, and a GPU kernel for faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the memory bandwidth and capacity bottleneck in LLM inference, which limits efficiency despite advancements in GPU computational power.

Method: The method involves scaling law analysis of TriLMs, quantization-aware training, and the development of 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, along with the TriRun GPU kernel.

Result: Results include the Spectra-1.1 suite of TriLMs trained on 1.2 trillion tokens, sustained performance gains, and up to 5x faster inference with TriRun compared to floating-point baselines.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for efficient LLM deployment, offering open resources like Spectra-1.1 and TriRun to advance research in ternary language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and
industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant
challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously
improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,
creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we
investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware
training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the
scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that
TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model
parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite
of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained
performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we
propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which
demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,
building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that
accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to
floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of
TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.
Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient
LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

*Yash Vardhan Tomar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate bias in ML models, achieving a 43.35% bias reduction and improved predictive performance without explicit bias attribute identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bias in ML models, as existing methods limit scalability and generalizability.

Method: Feature-wise mixing redistributes feature representations across datasets, evaluated using bias-sensitive loss functions and cross-validation.

Result: 43.35% average bias reduction and significant MSE decrease; outperformed SMOTE oversampling.

Conclusion: Feature-wise mixing is effective and efficient, with potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge
due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing
mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints.
However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability
and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a
feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by
redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To
assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained
using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,
including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a
standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an
average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in
MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,
benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that
feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and
demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias
attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the
computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning
algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for
real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes RL policy robustness by testing parameters under internal (synaptic filtering) and external (adversarial attacks) stresses, classifying them as fragile, robust, or antifragile. It validates the framework on PPO-trained agents, finding antifragile parameters that improve performance under stress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enhance RL policy robustness by examining how parameters respond to internal and external stresses, inspired by synaptic plasticity.

Method: Uses synaptic filtering for internal stress and adversarial attacks for external stress to classify parameters. Validates the framework on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco environments.

Result: Identifies antifragile parameters that boost policy performance under stress, showing the potential of targeted filtering for RL adaptability.

Conclusion: The findings lay groundwork for designing more robust and antifragile RL systems, with implications for future research.

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by
systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external
stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering
introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while
adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations.
This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust,
or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and
adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these
characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco
continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of
antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress,
demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL
policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future
advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in knowledge distillation from large-scale pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) to smaller models, proposing mutual information-aware optimization and MLP block reweighting for better transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of knowledge transfer drops when distilling from large-scale pretrained models, especially ViTs. The paper aims to improve this by fine-tuning methods.

Method: Proposes mutual information-aware optimization during fine-tuning and a heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks for small or imbalanced datasets.

Result: The method enhances knowledge transfer, allowing small student models to benefit from strong pretrained models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves distillation from large-scale pretrained ViTs to smaller models, particularly in challenging datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

TL;DR: A novel framework enhances Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable layers and residual learning to improve gradient flow and training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quanvolutional layers are static and lack adaptability, limiting QuNNs' potential. This research aims to overcome this by making these layers trainable.

Method: Proposes Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs) with residual blocks between layers to facilitate gradient flow and improve training.

Result: Empirical evidence shows strategic placement of residual blocks enhances gradient access, leading to efficient training and performance gains.

Conclusion: The framework advances quantum deep learning, offering theoretical and practical benefits for quantum computing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of
Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional
layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional
quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely
been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our
research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,
significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the
introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities
in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing
gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel
architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging
the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by
adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between
quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the
network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide
empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within
QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient
configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers
in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings
suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in
maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step
forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for
both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.

*Hanlin Dong,Arian Prabowo,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Double-Diffusion is a novel diffusion probabilistic model combining physics and stochasticity for air quality prediction, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle to balance certainty (physics) and uncertainty (stochasticity) in air quality prediction.

Method: Proposes Double-Diffusion, a physics-guided diffusion model with a new denoiser architecture and sampling strategy.

Result: Ranks first in evaluations, reduces inference time by 30-50%, and improves CRPS by 3-12%.

Conclusion: Double-Diffusion effectively balances physics and stochasticity, setting a new benchmark for air quality prediction.

Abstract: Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its
spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty.
Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural
Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through
probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right
balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open
question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion
probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air
quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while
precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air
pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative
approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted
from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks
first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with
other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while
enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score
(CRPS).

TL;DR: A framework evaluates concept alignment between LLMs and human psychology using questionnaires. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 and BERT in classification accuracy, showing measurable alignment with human constructs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how accurately LLMs internalize human psychological concepts, given their human-like text generation capabilities.

Method: Used 43 standardized psychological questionnaires to evaluate LLMs' ability to reconstruct and classify items via pairwise similarity analysis and hierarchical clustering.

Result: GPT-4 achieved 66.2% classification accuracy, outperforming GPT-3.5 (55.9%) and BERT (48.1%). GPT-4's semantic similarity correlated with human responses in questionnaires.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs can approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, aiding the development of more interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities
in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these
models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we
developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and
human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological
questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct
psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models
reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity
analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original
categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved
superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5
(55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%).
We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is
associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in
multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach
to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential
representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can
approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering
insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

### [399] [Curious Causality-Seeking Agents Learn Meta Causal World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23068)
*Zhiyu Zhao,Haoxuan Li,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang,Francesco Faccio,Jürgen Schmidhuber,Mengyue Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Meta-Causal Graph as a world model to address shifting causal mechanisms, proposing a Causality-Seeking Agent to identify and refine causal relationships through curiosity-driven exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments often exhibit shifting causal mechanisms due to narrow observational windows, making traditional world models inadequate.

Method: The Meta-Causal Graph encodes transformation rules for causal structures across latent states, with subgraphs triggered by meta states. The Causality-Seeking Agent identifies meta states, discovers causal relationships, and refines the graph iteratively.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and robot arm tasks show the method effectively captures causal dynamics shifts and generalizes to new contexts.

Conclusion: The Meta-Causal Graph and Causality-Seeking Agent provide a robust framework for modeling and adapting to dynamic causal mechanisms in complex environments.

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forget-MI is a machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, effectively removing sensitive patient data while preserving model performance and reducing privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy preservation in AI, especially in healthcare, is critical due to sensitive patient data. Existing methods struggle with unlearning in multimodal architectures.

Method: Forget-MI uses loss functions and perturbation techniques to unlearn unimodal and joint representations of data while retaining knowledge from remaining data.

Result: The method reduces MIA by 0.202, decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305, and matches test set performance of the retrained model.

Conclusion: Forget-MI outperforms existing approaches in privacy preservation and performance maintenance for multimodal medical data.

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Motivation: To enhance road safety, reduce accidents and costs, and support eco-friendly driving by improving maneuver recognition in vehicle telematics.

Method: Developed the maneuverRecognition Python package for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating driving data, including a customizable LSTM network.

Result: Demonstrated the package's effectiveness using real driving data from smartphone sensors of three individuals.

Conclusion: The maneuverRecognition package provides practical tools for maneuver recognition, filling a gap in Python-based solutions for this domain.

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces mirror descent policy optimization for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), achieving convergence guarantees under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety and robustness are critical in reinforcement learning; RCMDPs address these by ensuring long-term constraints and handling epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Uses policy gradient techniques to optimize policy (maximizer) and transition kernel (minimizer) on a Lagrangian for constrained MDPs.

Result: Achieves convergence rates of O(1/T) for Bregman divergence and O(e^-T) for entropy-regularized objectives in oracle-based settings, and O~(1/T^(1/3)) in sample-based settings.

Conclusion: Mirror descent policy optimization outperforms baselines in robustness and constrained optimization, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The
newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows
learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees
under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy
optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making
use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser)
and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian
representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance
as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence
rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we
obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate.
Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in
constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are
observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation
algorithms.

TL;DR: Proposes metrics (affinity and diversity) to assess synthetic data quality in wireless sensing, introduces SynCheck for quality-guided utilization, showing performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data in wireless sensing lacks quality metrics, leading to unpredictable performance gains and degraded task performance.

Method: Introduces tractable metrics (affinity and diversity) and SynCheck, a quality-guided scheme for refining synthetic data during training.

Result: SynCheck outperforms quality-oblivious methods, achieving a 4.3% improvement where others degrade performance by 13.4%.

Conclusion: Quality-guided synthetic data utilization (SynCheck) mitigates limitations and enhances wireless sensing task performance.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to
produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world
datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless
sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the
quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance
gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and
generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data -
affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in
current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task
performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of
awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate
these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data
utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model
training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms
quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance
improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

TL;DR: GAMA is an attribution method for generative models like LSTMs, enabling interpretability in biological sequence design without needing negative data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models lack interpretability, hindering biological insights. Negative data is often scarce or unreliable in biological settings.

Method: Developed GAMA, an attribution method based on Integrated Gradients, tested on synthetic and experimental antibody-antigen binding data.

Result: GAMA validated for recovering biologically relevant features and enabling interpretability in sequence design.

Conclusion: GAMA addresses the interpretability gap in generative models, facilitating biological insights without negative data.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic
design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched
for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require
both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be
trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity
antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where
negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the
lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to
extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this
gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution
method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We
assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize
its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically
relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it
to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model
interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies
without the need for negative training data.

TL;DR: The paper explores monophonic halfspaces in graphs, introducing a decomposition theorem for efficient learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address learning problems involving graph halfspaces, particularly monophonic halfspaces, and contrast them with geodesic halfspaces.

Method: Uses a $2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem to represent monophonic halfspaces as disjoint vertex subsets.

Result: Achieves efficient algorithms for teaching, active, and online learning, including polynomial-time empirical risk minimization.

Conclusion: Monophonic halfspaces are efficiently learnable, contrasting with NP-hard geodesic halfspaces, resolving open questions.

Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding
notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning
community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph
halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a
$2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent
monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this
decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various
learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably,
we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization.
Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and
proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently
learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the
realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature,
and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said
learning problems are NP-hard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a meta-representation framework, M2oE2, for residential load forecasting, using hypernetworks and Mixture-of-Experts to dynamically adapt models to external conditions, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate load forecasting is vital for power system reliability, but current models inadequately handle external factors like weather and pricing, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors introduce a hypernetwork-based framework that modulates a base DL model using external data as meta-knowledge, combined with a MoE mechanism for efficiency and robustness.

Result: M2oE2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across diverse datasets, with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed M2oE2 framework effectively leverages external data to enhance load forecasting, offering a scalable and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system
reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility.
However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors,
such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their
heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information.
We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to
dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a
meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected
parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external
conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further
integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through
selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant
external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for
External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and
robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code
are publicly available at

TL;DR: Proposes a reference model-based federated learning method for optimal fine-tuning, addressing catastrophic forgetting and improving model performance while reducing computing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning ensures privacy but may lack model performance and fail to meet diverse user needs. Optimization, fine-tuning, or personalization are needed for better results.

Method: Uses Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning with an optimal proximal term and a reference model to prevent catastrophic forgetting in each round.

Result: Achieves high model performance and low computing cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances privacy, performance, and efficiency in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial
intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning
scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of
concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy.
However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently
satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of
different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types
of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or
personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model
optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning
for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round.
This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning,
which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic
forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates
previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model
performance and low computing cost.

### [408] [Single Image Inpainting and Super-Resolution with Simultaneous Uncertainty Guarantees by Universal Reproducing Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23221)
*Bálint Horváth,Balázs Csanád Csáji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGKI, a kernel-based method for image inpainting and super-resolution, providing pixel estimates with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of estimating missing pixels in images while quantifying uncertainty, crucial for applications like inpainting and super-resolution.

Method: Proposes SGKI, an RKHS-based kernel method, extending prior work to include simultaneous confidence bands for missing pixels, using Schur complements for efficiency.

Result: SGKI effectively estimates missing pixels and provides non-asymptotic confidence bands, validated through experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SGKI offers a robust, uncertainty-aware solution for image inpainting and super-resolution, with potential extensions to vector-valued functions.

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

*Yukito Tajima,Nakamasa Inoue,Yusuke Sekikawa,Ikuro Sato,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGLUs introduce efficient gating in LLMs with reduced memory usage and faster inference, outperforming traditional GLUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory and speed inefficiency of GLUs in LLMs due to separate weight matrices for gating.

Method: Propose Masked Gated Linear Units (MGLUs) with Mixture of Element-wise Gating (MoEG) and FlashMGLU kernel for efficiency.

Result: MGLUs achieve 19.7x speed-up, 47% memory efficiency, and match/surpass SwiGLU accuracy in LLMs.

Conclusion: MGLUs offer a hardware-friendly, efficient alternative to GLUs without compromising performance.

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

*Lujun Li,Zhu Qiyuan,Jiacheng Wang,Wei Li,Hao Gu,Sirui Han,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sub-MoE introduces a compression framework for MoE LLMs using subspace expert merging to address parameter conflicts, achieving high performance retention with significant expert reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome memory, storage, and deployment challenges in MoE LLMs by resolving parameter conflicts from expert specialization.

Method: Uses joint SVD on expert weights, adaptive clustering, and subspace merging to align and fuse experts in a shared subspace.

Result: Maintains 96%|86% of original performance with 25%|50% expert reduction on Mixtral-8x7B.

Conclusion: Sub-MoE outperforms existing methods, offering efficient MoE compression without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive
parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges.
Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by
consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter
conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present
Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key
insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated
expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared
$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$
components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)
Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via
K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)
Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to
derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues
frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert
reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse
experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression
for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek,
and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms
existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains
96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on
Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released at

*Hans Peter Lynsgøe Raaschou-jensen,Constanza Fierro,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the unpredictability of reasoning time in models with hidden chains of thought, proposing methods to predict and display this time to improve user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users lack insight into how long models will spend reasoning, leading to frustration, especially as models handle longer tasks asynchronously.

Method: Introduces and evaluates online and offline methods to predict model "thinking time," akin to a "progress bar for reasoning."

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the methods aim to provide predictability in reasoning time.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of user interaction improvements and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as
powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive
tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability,
openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user
experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model
will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can
lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce
increasingly long tasks asynchronously
\citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking
time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss
the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

### [412] [BAPE: Learning an Explicit Bayes Classifier for Long-tailed Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23280)
*Chaoqun Du,Yulin Wang,Shiji Song,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BAPE, a method to explicitly model posterior probabilities for Bayes classifier learning, addressing gradient imbalance in long-tailed data and ensuring optimal decision rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods implicitly estimate posterior probabilities, failing in long-tailed real-world data distributions due to gradient imbalance and suboptimal decisions.

Method: BAPE explicitly models posterior probabilities using point estimation, directly learning the Bayes classifier without gradient descent. It includes a distribution adjustment technique for adapting to test data.

Result: BAPE improves generalization on long-tailed datasets (CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist) without extra computational cost.

Conclusion: BAPE outperforms existing methods by explicitly addressing posterior estimation and gradient imbalance, offering a simple yet effective solution for long-tailed learning.

Abstract: Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal
approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep
learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by
\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by
minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been
proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.
However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real
world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the
Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a
novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of
the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the
posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,
our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based
on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and
ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a
straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This
method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set
to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance
factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional
computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are
orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they
are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the
posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT,
CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks,
despite its simplicity.

*Alan Jeffares,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the focus on isolated, counterintuitive deep learning phenomena, arguing they lack real-world relevance but can still refine broader theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the efficiency and relevance of studying isolated deep learning phenomena like double descent and grokking, advocating for alignment with broader field progress.

Method: Analyzes research outcomes of prominent phenomena and revisits community norms, proposing practical recommendations.

Result: Finds little evidence of real-world applicability for these phenomena but acknowledges their value in refining general theories.

Conclusion: Recommends aligning research on deep learning phenomena with broader field goals to ensure pragmatic progress.

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena
has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent
years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket
hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc
hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,
case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,
there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world
applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the
broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles
that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we
suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing
unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more
general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the
research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the
recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in
approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future
research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well
aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of
deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HDTree introduces a diffusion-based approach for modeling hierarchical single-cell data, improving stability and generative capacity compared to traditional and VAE-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for hierarchical single-cell data analysis face computational and performance limitations, and recent VAE-based approaches struggle with stability and deep hierarchical relationships.

Method: HDTree uses a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized diffusion processes to model tree node transitions, eliminating branch-specific modules.

Result: HDTree outperforms existing methods in accuracy and performance on general-purpose and single-cell datasets.

Conclusion: HDTree provides a robust tool for hierarchical lineage analysis, enhancing modeling of cellular differentiation paths and supporting downstream biological tasks.

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell
differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological
processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that
represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face
limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,
and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing
these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree
branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical
relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based
approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a
hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized
diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves
stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative
capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion
process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both
general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods
in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool
for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient
modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream
biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of LLMs generating chemically invalid or impractical structures in molecular design for drug discovery.

Method: Combines prompt engineering, automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM.

Result: Achieves 83% valid chemical structures and up to 17-fold predicted improvements in target affinity.

Conclusion: Offers a generalizable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications with quantifiable reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

*Keziah Naggita,Julienne LaChance*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights biases and instability in data valuation methods, showing how pre-processing and algorithmic choices can skew results, harm underrepresented groups, and increase class imbalance. It proposes the DValCards framework for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the biases and instability in data valuation methods, which can lead to unfair compensation in data markets and harm underrepresented groups.

Method: Analyzed 9 tabular classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods to demonstrate biases and instability.

Result: Found that pre-processing alters data values, subsampling increases class imbalance, and underrepresented data is undervalued.

Conclusion: Advocates for transparency via the DValCards framework to mitigate misuse and promote responsible ML.

Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML),
various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution
of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data
cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the
context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly
compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are
inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices,
resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular
classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1)
common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter
estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase
class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented
group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency
associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data
Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of
DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data
pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

TL;DR: FTS is a federated framework for training generative models on distributed EHR data, using tokenized patient timelines and federated learning to ensure privacy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generative modeling of EHR data across institutions without sharing raw data, addressing privacy and scalability challenges.

Method: Tokenizes patient histories into PHTs, trains local autoregressive transformers, aggregates weights centrally, and synthesizes data for a global model.

Result: GG performs comparably to models trained on real data in clinical prediction tasks.

Conclusion: FTS provides privacy, scalability, and extensibility for healthcare applications like counterfactual inference and synthetic trials.

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training
generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to
electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as
tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding
temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution
trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model
weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a
large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling
zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS
on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing
that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to
those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability
across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation
tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early
warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

*Dominik Meier,Sujai Hiremath,Promit Ghosal,Kyra Gan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of causal discovery in bivariate data with unmeasured mediators, proposing a new method, BiDD, which outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard additive noise models (ANMs) fail with unobserved mediators, and prior solutions are brittle in practice.

Method: BiDD uses a novel independence test during noising/denoising processes to infer causality, avoiding reliance on mean squared error comparisons.

Result: BiDD shows consistent performance in synthetic and real-world data, excelling in mediator-corrupted settings.

Conclusion: BiDD is a robust solution for causal discovery, especially when hidden mediators are present.

Abstract: Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a
foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional
assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable
sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based
methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between
variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously
characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of
unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden
mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical
utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)
for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by
unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through
mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel
independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for
each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the
independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic
consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under
hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted
settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neurosymbolic approach combining LLMs with logic-based reasoning (Prolog) to address limitations in logical reasoning and interpretability, improving precision and reliability in multi-step tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack strict logical reasoning and interpretability, limiting their effectiveness in complex domains requiring discrete decision-making.

Method: Augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules (Prolog predicates and toolsets) to decompose queries into verifiable sub-tasks and mitigate failures like hallucination.

Result: Experiments on DABStep benchmark show improved precision, coverage, and documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Hybrid LLM-logic architecture enhances reliability, interpretability, and scalability for trustworthy AI in complex domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of
artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic
orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic
inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical
reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper
investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that
augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging
Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and
explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries
into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common
failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We
demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through
experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and
system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that
combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor,
enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy,
interpretable AI agents across complex domains.

TL;DR: A tool called BenchMake is introduced to transform scientific datasets into benchmarks using non-negative matrix factorization to identify edge cases and create statistically significant testing sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark datasets are rare in computational science, making it hard to evaluate new methods. BenchMake aims to address this gap by leveraging openly available scientific datasets.

Method: BenchMake uses non-negative matrix factorization to isolate challenging edge cases on the convex hull and partitions data into testing sets to maximize divergence and significance across various data types.

Result: The tool was tested on ten public benchmark sets, showing effectiveness in creating meaningful splits compared to established and random methods.

Conclusion: BenchMake provides a scalable solution to generate benchmarks from scientific datasets, enhancing evaluation of computational methods.

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and
applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The
relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the
uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains,
makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In
this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the
increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a
benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix
factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases
on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data
instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a
testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across
tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are
compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available
benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes,
distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PETSA is a parameter-efficient test-time adaptation method for time series forecasting, using small calibration modules and specialized loss components to improve adaptability without full model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series are non-stationary, degrading pre-trained models' performance. Existing TTA methods update full models, increasing costs.

Method: PETSA updates only small calibration modules using low-rank adapters and dynamic gating. It employs a specialized loss with robust, frequency-domain, and patch-wise structural terms.

Result: PETSA improves adaptability of forecasting backbones with fewer parameters, achieving competitive or better performance across all horizons.

Conclusion: PETSA offers a parameter-efficient solution for test-time adaptation in time series forecasting, balancing performance and resource usage.

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the
performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods
typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We
propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test
time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA
uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without
retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we
introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)
a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise
structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of
various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive
or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at:

*Mohamed Elbasheer,Adewale Akinfaderin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) method with a Transformer Encoder for insider threat detection, achieving high accuracy and low error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture sequential dependencies in user behavior, limiting their effectiveness in detecting subtle insider threats.

Method: Proposes UBS to structure temporal sequences from the CERT dataset, using a Transformer Encoder for modeling benign activity and reconstruction errors as anomaly scores, evaluated with OCSVM, LOF, and iForest.

Result: Achieves 96.61% accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and low false negative (0.0057) and positive (0.0571) rates.

Conclusion: The UBS-Transformer pipeline outperforms baselines, proving sequential user modeling and advanced anomaly detection are effective for insider threat detection.

Abstract: Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized
status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing
machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby
failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we
propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT
insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep
sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model
benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores.
These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier
detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and
Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets,
including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer
pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61%

false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and
conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential
user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

*Chunjing Xiao,Jiahui Lu,Xovee Xu,Fan Zhou,Tianshu Xie,Wei Lu,Lifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TripleAD is a triple-channel framework for graph anomaly detection, addressing attribute, structural, and mixed anomalies via mutual distillation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised approaches struggle with balancing attribute and structural anomaly detection, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: TripleAD uses three modules: multiscale attribute estimation, link-enhanced structure estimation, and attribute-mixed curvature, with mutual distillation for collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments show TripleAD outperforms strong baselines in detecting various anomaly types.

Conclusion: TripleAD effectively mitigates interference between anomaly types and improves detection performance.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and
economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses.
Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of
detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the
tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in
suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual
distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It
includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and
mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of
anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation
module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing
issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced
structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information
flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an
attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and
structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual
distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and
collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.

*Haolan Guo,Linwei Tao,Haoyang Luo,Minjing Dong,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMART is a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method for neural networks that scales logits based on the logit gap, achieving state-of-the-art calibration with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks are overconfident, posing risks in safety-critical scenarios, and current calibration methods struggle with bias-variance trade-offs.

Method: SMART uses the logit gap (margin between top two logits) as a denoised signal and employs a SoftECE objective for adaptive binning.

Result: SMART achieves superior calibration performance with limited data and fewer parameters compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SMART provides a robust, efficient solution for uncertainty quantification in neural networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: FedWSQ improves federated learning by combining weight standardization and distribution-aware quantization, reducing communication overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in FL due to data heterogeneity and communication constraints.

Method: Integrates weight standardization (WS) to filter biased updates and distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ) to minimize errors.

Result: FedWSQ outperforms existing methods in challenging FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and low-bit communication.

Conclusion: FedWSQ is a robust FL framework that enhances performance and reduces communication costs effectively.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

*Kento Imaizumi,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Quasi-Hyperbolic Momentum (QHM) in stochastic nonconvex optimization, showing that increasing batch size, not decaying learning rates, improves convergence for neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically justify the effectiveness of momentum methods like QHM in stochastic nonconvex settings, such as deep neural networks, where current understanding is limited.

Method: The study provides asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with increasing batch size, comparing it to decaying learning rates.

Result: Asymptotic convergence requires either decaying learning rates or increasing batch sizes, but the latter is more effective for non-asymptotic performance. Experiments confirm benefits of finite batch size increases.

Conclusion: Mini-batch QHM with increasing batch size, without decaying learning rates, is a superior strategy for training neural networks.

Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex
objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep
neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization
-- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings
remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that
generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand
the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide
both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with
an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence
requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a
decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we
demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without
decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments
show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for
training neural networks.

TL;DR: The paper explores the universal approximation property (UAP) in transformer architectures, introducing a unified framework and a general sufficient condition for UAP based on token distinguishability. It simplifies verification using analyticity assumptions and applies the framework to various attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend theoretical understanding of UAP to transformer architectures, unifying prior work on residual networks and addressing gaps in coverage for attention-based models.

Method: Introduces a general sufficient condition for UAP, leverages analyticity assumptions to simplify verification, and applies the framework to transformers with diverse attention mechanisms.

Result: Proves UAP for transformers with various attention mechanisms, generalizes prior works, and provides a foundation for designing architectures with UAP guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework advances theoretical understanding of UAP in transformers, enabling principled design of architectures with inherent approximation guarantees.

Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type
architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior
results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our
work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP
and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of
architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we
can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a
non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers
with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention
mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or
establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our
framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer
architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific
functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.

TL;DR: Transition Matching (TM) unifies diffusion/flow models and continuous autoregressive generation, introducing flexible design avenues through Markov transitions. Three TM variants (DTM, ARTM, FHTM) achieve state-of-the-art performance in image quality, text adherence, and sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in diffusion/flow models and unify text/media generation by introducing a novel generative paradigm.

Method: TM decomposes generation tasks into Markov transitions, enabling non-deterministic kernels and arbitrary supervision. Three variants (DTM, ARTM, FHTM) explore different transition designs.

Result: DTM generalizes flow matching, achieving top image quality and text adherence. ARTM and FHTM generalize continuous AR methods, with FHTM matching flow-based methods in text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: TM advances generative modeling by unifying diffusion/flow and AR approaches, offering flexibility and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media
generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further
improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those
generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for
unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching
(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies
and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM
decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing
for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary
non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design
avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference
Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by
directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image
quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)
Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition
Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that
generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation
quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless
integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the
first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based
methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these
contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and
relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and
hyperparameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces A2P, a framework for Anomaly Prediction (AP) using Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP) to predict future anomalies in time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to predict specific future anomalies, focusing only on immediate ones or lacking precision.

Method: A2P combines AAF to learn anomaly relationships and SAP with an Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP) to simulate diverse anomaly patterns.

Result: A2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting future anomalies across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: A2P effectively addresses the AP task, offering a robust solution for forecasting future anomalies.

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important
scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting
specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly
Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time
series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to
provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we
propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of
Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To
enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a
strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of
anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP)
that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to
predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank Representation model with CNNs for imputing missing Water Quality Data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of missing data in water quality monitoring due to sensor failures and communication delays, which lead to High-Dimensional and Sparse data.

Method: Uses CNNs to fuse temporal features and extract nonlinear interactions for deep fusion of multidimensional information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in estimation accuracy on three real datasets.

Conclusion: Provides an effective solution for handling water quality data in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental
monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However,
water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of
missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and
communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming
High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are
difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data
features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank
Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing
temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,
and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine
higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional
information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It
provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in
complex dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular exponentiation is vital in cryptography but lacks mechanistic interpretability. The study aims to understand how transformers learn and encode numerical reasoning.

Method: A 4-layer encoder-decoder transformer is trained. Techniques like PCA-based embedding analysis and activation patching are used to study number-theoretic encoding.

Result: Reciprocal operand training boosts performance with sudden generalization. A subgraph of attention heads in the final layer suffices for regular exponentiation.

Conclusion: Transformers learn modular arithmetic via specialized circuits, offering insights for interpretable and efficient neural approaches.

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet
remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We
train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and
investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing
principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation
patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the
model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance
gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized
accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model
internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting
entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full
performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that
transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational
circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches
to modular exponentiation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in supervised bridge methods by incorporating structural information (measurement models) for better inverse problem solutions.

Method: Introduce System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), embedding linear measurement systems into matrix-valued SDE coefficients.

Result: SDBs show consistent improvements in diverse linear inverse problems and robust generalization under system misspecification.

Conclusion: SDBs offer a promising solution for real-world inverse problems by leveraging structural information effectively.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy
measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based
generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this
task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt
pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods
that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data.
While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the
latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System
embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge
methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the
coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields
consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates
robust generalization under system misspecification between training and
deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of watermarking images generated by diffusion and autoregressive models to detect unauthorized use, proposing a new method for autoregressive models inspired by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generative models requires costly datasets, and unauthorized use of generated images is a concern. Watermarking can help detect misuse, but existing methods fail to retain radioactivity (persistence through training).

Method: Analyzes watermark radioactivity in diffusion and autoregressive models, proposes a novel watermarking method for autoregressive models inspired by techniques in large language models.

Result: Existing watermarking for diffusion models fails; the new method for autoregressive models effectively preserves radioactivity, enabling robust provenance tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the radioactivity challenge in autoregressive models, preventing unauthorized use of generated images.

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Motivation: To unify and simplify the training of spiking neural networks (SNNs) by addressing the limitations of gradient-based methods, such as inefficiency and lack of flexibility with discrete/continuous weights.

Method: Proposes a gradient-free Expectation-Propagation framework that learns marginal distributions of parameters and marginalizes nuisance parameters, applicable to deterministic and stochastic SNNs.

Result: The method converges faster in practice than gradient-based approaches, without extensive data passes, and demonstrates effectiveness in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising direction for efficient training of deep Bayesian networks, overcoming traditional gradient-based limitations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training
spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free
method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters
and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of
hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete

using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the
algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without
requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The
classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient
training methods for deep Bayesian networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel model-driven trace clustering method optimizes stochastic process models using entropic relevance for better interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High variability in process discovery leads to complex models; existing clustering techniques neglect stochasticity, limiting real-world dynamics capture.

Method: Proposes a method using entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric, to guide trace assignment based on structural alignment and likelihood.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, improves interpretability, and scales linearly with input size.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures real-world dynamics and shifts performance rankings when stochasticity is considered.

Abstract: Process discovery algorithms automatically extract process models from event
logs, but high variability often results in complex and hard-to-understand
models. To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process
executions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable
process model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning
traces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process
models. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process
model discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or
probability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to
capture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace
clustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.
Our approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on
directly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows
clustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's
process model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given
stochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales
linearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing
clusters with clearer control-flow patterns. Extensive experiments on public
real-life datasets show that our method outperforms existing alternatives in
representing process behavior and reveals how clustering performance rankings
can shift when stochasticity is considered.

TL;DR: WATS is a post-hoc calibration framework for GNNs using graph wavelets to improve confidence estimates without retraining, outperforming existing methods in calibration error and variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs' confidence estimates often misalign with correctness, limiting their use in safety-critical applications. Existing methods rely on coarse statistics, ignoring fine-grained graph topology.

Method: WATS uses heat-kernel graph wavelet features to assign node-specific temperatures for calibration, avoiding retraining or neighbor data.

Result: WATS achieves the lowest ECE, outperforming baselines by up to 42.3%, and reduces calibration variance by 17.24% on average. It scales efficiently across diverse graphs.

Conclusion: WATS effectively addresses GNN calibration issues by leveraging graph wavelets, offering a scalable and topology-sensitive solution.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance
on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with
actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in
safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek
to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop
statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,
thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph
topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a
post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on
tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the
scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence
estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring
logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets
with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS
achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared
methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to
42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared
with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,
scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be
released based on publication.

TL;DR: KAIROS is a scalable, model-agnostic framework for data valuation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency by using MMD-based influence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data valuation methods are biased, costly, or inaccurate, limiting their practical use in regulatory compliance and AI asset valuation.

Method: KAIROS assigns distributional influence scores based on MMD between training data and a clean reference set, avoiding retraining and offering closed-form solutions.

Result: KAIROS achieves up to 50x speedup, outperforms baselines in accuracy and runtime, and provides theoretical guarantees for ranking and interpretability.

Conclusion: KAIROS offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for data valuation, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory
compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods
remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and
inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley
require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based
model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to
their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable,
model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional
influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike
Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution
that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error,
requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for
unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient
online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated
in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking
quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks
show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,
and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings
and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

*Chang Qi,Matteo Forasassi,Thomas Lukasiewicz,Tommaso Salvatori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance degradation in deep predictive coding networks by rebalancing layer errors and improving weight updates, achieving results comparable to backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance drops in deep predictive coding networks due to imbalanced errors and ineffective guidance in deeper layers.

Method: Introduces precision-weighting for latent variables and a novel weight update mechanism to address error accumulation.

Result: Significant improvements in test accuracy for networks with over seven layers, matching backpropagation performance.

Conclusion: Better understanding of the relaxation phase is key for scaling equilibrium propagation, enabling complex task applications.

Abstract: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural
models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process.
Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow
architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds
five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this
degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during
weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in
guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two
novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to
re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation
phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that
reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods
on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large
improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with
performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings
suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to
train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities
for their application in complex tasks.

TL;DR: A novel adaptive anomaly detection framework for sequential random finite set (RFS) observations, distinguishing normal from anomalous data by detecting deviations from expected statistical behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To monitor and detect anomalies in sequential RFS observations by learning normal behavior online and adapting dynamically to behavioral shifts.

Method: Introduces Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), a new class of RFS-based posterior distributions, for adapting to systematic changes and detecting anomalies via a predictive posterior density function.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through extensive qualitative and quantitative simulation experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully adapts to behavioral shifts and accurately identifies anomalies in point pattern data.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a novel adaptive anomaly detection framework
specifically designed for monitoring sequential random finite set (RFS)
observations. Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data
(normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the
expected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this
study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not
only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also
dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point
patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior
distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate
adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of
point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative
and quantitative simulation experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits SGD with AdaGrad-type preconditioning, providing a unified convergence analysis and connecting Scion and DASGO. It also shows acceleration with Nesterov momentum, justifying AdaGrad-type algorithms' practical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and improve the theoretical understanding of adaptive gradient methods, particularly AdaGrad-type algorithms, and explore their acceleration with momentum.

Method: Develops a unified convergence analysis for SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic smoothness and noise, and investigates acceleration using Nesterov momentum.

Result: Recovers state-of-the-art convergence results for AdaGrad variants, connects Scion and DASGO, and proves acceleration beyond known rates with momentum.

Conclusion: AdaGrad-type algorithms can benefit from both diagonal preconditioning and momentum, explaining their practical efficiency, as seen in Adam.

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type
preconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified
convergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or
matrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover
state-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient
methods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In
addition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed
algorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for
the latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and
DASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov
momentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that
AdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal
preconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the
practical efficiency of Adam.

*Durgesh Singh,Ahcene Boubekki,Robert Jenssen,Michael C. Kampffmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel SSL approach using differentiable clustering to improve performance and compatibility with other SSL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods focus on complex consistency regularization or entropy minimization, lacking simplicity and explicit clustering assumptions.

Method: Extends a differentiable clustering module, using annotated data to guide cluster centroids for a simple, end-to-end trainable SSL model.

Result: Outperforms supervised-only baselines and enhances other SSL methods when combined.

Conclusion: The proposed method simplifies SSL by incorporating clustering assumptions, improving performance and flexibility.

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EFPI, a method for recognizing football team formations and assigning player positions using predefined templates and cost minimization from tracking data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding team formations and player positioning is essential for tactical analysis in football.

Method: EFPI uses linear sum assignment to match players to template formations by minimizing distance costs, scales player positions to template dimensions, and includes a stability parameter to avoid unnecessary changes.

Result: The method effectively recognizes formations for individual frames or larger game segments and is available as open-source code.

Conclusion: EFPI provides a flexible and accurate solution for formation recognition in football, with potential applications in tactical analysis.

Abstract: Understanding team formations and player positioning is crucial for tactical
analysis in football (soccer). This paper presents a flexible method for
formation recognition and player position assignment in football using
predefined static formation templates and cost minimization from spatiotemporal
tracking data, called EFPI. Our approach employs linear sum assignment to
optimally match players to positions within a set of template formations by
minimizing the total distance between actual player locations and template
positions, subsequently selecting the formation with the lowest assignment
cost. To improve accuracy, we scale actual player positions to match the
dimensions of these formation templates in both width and length. While the
method functions effectively on individual frames, it extends naturally to
larger game segments such as complete periods, possession sequences or specific
intervals (e.g. 10 second intervals, 5 minute intervals etc.). Additionally, we
incorporate an optional stability parameter that prevents unnecessary formation
changes when assignment costs differ only marginally between time segments.
EFPI is available as open-source code through the unravelsports Python package.

TL;DR: SAEs are less effective for known concepts but powerful for discovering unknown ones, clarifying their utility in ML and sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconcile competing narratives about SAEs by distinguishing their effectiveness for known vs. unknown concepts.

Method: Conceptual distinction between SAEs' roles in acting on known concepts and discovering unknown ones.

Result: SAEs are useful for ML interpretability, fairness, and applications in social/health sciences.

Conclusion: SAEs have distinct applications, clarifying their value despite skepticism.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a
series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness.
Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

TL;DR: The paper explores using plants as natural sensors for environmental monitoring, integrating them with wearable devices and machine learning to achieve high accuracy in classifying environmental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage plants as natural sensors for ecological and agricultural applications, enabling real-time monitoring of environmental conditions.

Method: Equipped *Hedera helix* with a wearable device (PhytoNode) to record electrophysiological activity outdoors, analyzed data using AutoML and manual tuning.

Result: Achieved high performance (95% macro F1 score) in binary classification tasks, with AutoML outperforming manual tuning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable, self-sustaining biohybrid systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Living plants, while contributing to ecological balance and climate
regulation, also function as natural sensors capable of transmitting
information about their internal physiological states and surrounding
conditions. This rich source of data provides potential for applications in
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. With integration into
biohybrid systems, we establish novel channels of physiological signal flow
between living plants and artificial devices. We equipped *Hedera helix* with a
plant-wearable device called PhytoNode to continuously record the plant's
electrophysiological activity. We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor
environment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions.
Over five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and
automated machine learning (AutoML). Our classification models achieve high
performance, reaching macro F1 scores of up to 95 percent in binary tasks.
AutoML approaches outperformed manual tuning, and selecting subsets of
statistical features further improved accuracy. Our biohybrid living system
monitors the electrophysiology of plants in harsh, real-world conditions. This
work advances scalable, self-sustaining, and plant-integrated living biohybrid
systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

*Yuta Sato,Kazuhiko Kawamoto,Hiroshi Kera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to reorder decoder input tokens in Transformers for arithmetic tasks, identifying learning-friendly sequences by analyzing early loss drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The order of intermediate steps in reasoning critically affects Transformer performance, prompting the need to optimize token sequences for learning.

Method: A pipeline trains a Transformer on mixed-order sequences, identifies benign orders via early loss drops, and uses a hierarchical approach for efficient reordering.

Result: The method successfully identifies learning-friendly orders from billions of candidates, even recovering known optimal sequences like reverse-digit order for multiplication.

Conclusion: Optimizing token order in Transformers improves learning efficiency, with the proposed method proving effective for arithmetic tasks.

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform
step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of
these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study
addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder
input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn
arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture
of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign
orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space
grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical
approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four
order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a
learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the
multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior
studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) strategy using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) to control resin flow in composite manufacturing processes like resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM), ensuring uniform impregnation and avoiding defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing resin flow dynamics in composite manufacturing, which is critical for preventing defects like porosities and dry spots, and ensuring structural integrity.

Method: A reinforcement learning (RL) approach, specifically Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), is applied to synchronize resin flow fronts in a simulated process with two resin inlets and one outlet.

Result: The RL strategy effectively achieves accurate flow convergence, demonstrating its potential for improving process control and product quality.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach shows promise for enhancing resin flow control in composite manufacturing, leading to better product quality and structural integrity.

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes
for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites,
particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades.
Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure
the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing
residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural
integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning
(RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising
the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin
inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our
approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially
observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL
approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential
towards improving process control and product quality in composites
manufacturing.

TL;DR: An AI-powered framework translates complex medical documents into marginalized languages, addressing healthcare access barriers in Africa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions in Africa face healthcare access issues due to language and literacy gaps, especially with donated prosthetic devices lacking accessible documentation.

Method: The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and NLP models for real-time translation and question-answering in local languages.

Result: The framework successfully processes and translates medical manuals into Pidgin and is designed for easy extension to other languages.

Conclusion: This work improves healthcare accessibility by providing localized, real-time answers to medical queries in underserved populations.

Abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing healthcare
due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this challenge by
transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user
manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study
in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for
communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the
accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available
in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local
populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context).
The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our
open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to
other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed
to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for
prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users --
such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical
equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive
accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic
understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and
multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility
to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering
patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADReFT is a novel method for improving ADS safety by identifying critical states and generating adaptive repairs using a transformer-based model, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online repair methods for ADSs lack generalizability and adaptability, often being overly conservative and ineffective.

Method: ADReFT uses a transformer-based model with State Monitor and Decision Adapter heads, pretrained with supervised learning and finetuned with reinforcement learning.

Result: ADReFT achieves better repair performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ADReFT effectively enhances ADS safety by providing adaptive and precise repair actions.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due
to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.
Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the
runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions
enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into
acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based
constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack
generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in
ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently
but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we
propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method
that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed
tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.
Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint
heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving
environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate
adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety
identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse
annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and
others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to
mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat
conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT
using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate
more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation
results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

TL;DR: Meta FAIR introduces Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), a family of AI models trained on 500M atomic structures, achieving high speed, accuracy, and generalization across chemical domains without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fast and accurate computation of atomic properties in chemistry and materials science applications like drug discovery and energy storage.

Method: UMA models use a novel 'mixture of linear experts' architecture, scaling model capacity with dataset size, and are trained on diverse chemical data (molecules, materials, catalysts).

Result: UMA models perform comparably or better than specialized models across domains without fine-tuning, with efficient parameter usage (e.g., 1.4B total but ~50M active per structure).

Conclusion: UMA models advance AI in computational chemistry, with released code, weights, and data to foster further development and application.

Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic
simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in
chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and
semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family
of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed,
accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique
3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data
across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We
develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model
capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and
medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of
linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing
speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only ~50M active
parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of
applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model
without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized
models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to
accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to
build increasingly capable AI models.

*Zain ul Abdeen,Vassilis Kekatos,Ming Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a convex training framework for neural networks to enforce global Lipschitz constraints, improving robustness and scalability via semidefinite relaxation and randomized subspace techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certified robustness is essential for safety-critical applications, but existing Lipschitz-constrained training methods suffer from non-convexity and poor scalability.

Method: The framework uses semidefinite relaxation and loop transformation for convex admissibility, and a randomized subspace approach (RS-LMI) to decompose global constraints into scalable layerwise constraints.

Result: Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet show competitive accuracy, improved Lipschitz bounds, and better runtime.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a tractable and certifiable way to train robust neural networks with global Lipschitz guarantees.

Abstract: Certified robustness is a critical property for deploying neural networks
(NN) in safety-critical applications. A principle approach to achieving such
guarantees is to constrain the global Lipschitz constant of the network.
However, accurate methods for Lipschitz-constrained training often suffer from
non-convex formulations and poor scalability due to reliance on global
semidefinite programs (SDPs). In this letter, we propose a convex training
framework that enforces global Lipschitz constraints via semidefinite
relaxation. By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a
convex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training.
While the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is
limited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized
subspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the
global constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto
low-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training
objective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly
improved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominance of closed, proprietary platforms limits data exchange and interoperability, reinforcing monopolistic behaviors.

Method: Proposes using LLM-based agents to automatically translate data formats and interact with human-designed interfaces, enabling seamless interoperability.

Result: Universal interoperability undermines monopolies and promotes data portability but introduces security risks and technical debt.

Conclusion: The ML community should embrace AI-mediated interoperability while developing frameworks to mitigate risks, restoring user freedom and competitive markets.

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

TL;DR: TTA-VLM is a benchmark addressing limitations in current TTA research for VLMs, offering a unified framework, diverse evaluation metrics, and extended model coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA research lacks fair comparisons due to duplicated results, limited metrics, and inconsistent settings, hindering practical insights.

Method: TTA-VLM implements 15 TTA methods (8 episodic, 7 online) across 15 datasets, evaluates beyond accuracy, and includes models like SigLIP and training-time tuning methods.

Result: Findings show limited TTA gains, poor collaboration with fine-tuning, and accuracy improvements often reduce model trustworthiness.

Conclusion: TTA-VLM aims to foster fair comparisons and encourage reliable, generalizable TTA strategies for VLMs.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced
model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and
comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical
performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement
learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free
settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational
intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness
and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant
of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates
sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic
tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where
$S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode
length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a
logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the
optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance
compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and
Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

*Veronica Lachi,Francesco Ferrini,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini,Manfred Jaeger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the expressive power of GNNs for link representation, introduces a unifying framework, and shows that expressive models outperform simpler ones in high-symmetry scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of GNNs has focused on graph-level representations, leaving link representation underexplored. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$ framework to unify and compare link models, derives a hierarchy of methods, and proposes a synthetic benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Expressive models outperform simpler ones in high-symmetry scenarios, though they may underperform on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dataset-aware model selection is crucial, as expressive models excel in challenging, high-symmetry conditions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of
node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical
understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on
graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and
provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link
representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$
framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables
formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy
of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future
architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation
protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess
link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in
practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of
distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on
standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry
increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

*Gen Li,Yuchen Zhou,Yuting Wei,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free sampling algorithm for diffusion models accelerates approximation of target data distributions without retraining, using high-order ODE solvers and Lagrange interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve provable acceleration in diffusion models without additional training, addressing limitations like smoothness or log-concavity assumptions.

Method: Proposes a principled sampling algorithm using high-order ODE solvers, Lagrange interpolation, and successive refinement for accurate score function evaluations.

Result: The algorithm requires fewer score function evaluations (order of $d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K}$) and is robust to inexact score estimation.

Conclusion: The method efficiently approximates target distributions without retraining, offering a robust and broadly applicable solution.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates mixed training strategies using hybrid datasets (synthetic and real data) to bridge the domain gap in ANN training, analyzing their impact on performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The disparity between synthetic and real data causes poor ANN performance in real-world scenarios, prompting the need for systematic evaluation of mixed training strategies.

Method: The study analyzes two mixing strategies on three architectures and three hybrid datasets, varying synthetic-to-real data proportions.

Result: The findings offer insights into optimizing synthetic data use to improve ANN robustness and efficacy.

Conclusion: The research contributes to better understanding and application of synthetic data in ANN training.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for
training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between
synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor
performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world
scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which
combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.
While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic
evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and
architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study
comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent
architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we
sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to
investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this
paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in
the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and
efficacy.

### [460] [Data Uniformity Improves Training Efficiency and More, with a Convergence Framework Beyond the NTK Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24120)
*Yuqing Wang,Shangding Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selecting uniformly distributed data improves training efficiency and performance in LLMs by increasing minimum pairwise distance between data points, which accelerates gradient descent and reduces approximation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify general principles of data selection that consistently improve performance in complex tasks with limited prior knowledge, beyond known factors like data quality and diversity.

Method: Theoretical analysis of gradient descent dynamics and approximation error in neural networks, focusing on the impact of data uniformity (measured by minimum pairwise distance). Experiments on supervised fine-tuning across various settings.

Result: Uniform data distribution (maximizing pairwise distance) accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Data uniformity is a general and effective principle for data selection, enhancing training efficiency and model performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including
in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties
such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known
to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist
other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can
consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited
prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly
distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.
Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads
to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by
$h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training
dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the
approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our
analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including
transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further
provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and
function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct
comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,
including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by
maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves
comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and

*Dong Sixun,Fan Wei,Teresa Wu,Fu Yanjie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal contrastive learning framework transforms time series into visual and textual modalities, enhancing forecasting by aligning these views and selecting informative variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unimodal numerical inputs struggle with semantic patterns, and text-based LLMs lack perceptual intuition like visual interpretation.

Method: Proposes a framework to convert time series into visual and textual perspectives, aligns them via contrastive learning, and uses a variate selection module for forecasting.

Result: Outperforms unimodal and cross-modal baselines on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: Multimodal alignment significantly improves time series forecasting by capturing richer representations.

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:

*Daniel Ciganda,Ignacio Campón,Iñaki Permanyer,Jakob H Macke*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework using SNPE infers behavioral and biological parameters from aggregate fertility data, predicting micro-level reproductive behaviors and enabling synthetic life histories for forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the behavioral mechanisms behind fertility trends masked by aggregate data like ASFRs.

Method: Develops a likelihood-free Bayesian framework with SNPE, coupling an individual-level reproductive model with aggregate data (ASFRs and planned/unplanned birth profiles).

Result: Successfully predicts micro-level distributions (e.g., age at first sex, inter-birth intervals) and reproduces fertility schedules for U.S. and Latin American cohorts.

Conclusion: The model enables behaviorally explicit population forecasts and supports demographic digital twins by generating synthetic life histories.

Abstract: While age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) provide the most extensive record
of reproductive change, their aggregate nature masks the underlying behavioral
mechanisms that ultimately drive fertility trends. To recover these mechanisms,
we develop a likelihood-free Bayesian framework that couples an
individual-level model of the reproductive process with Sequential Neural
Posterior Estimation (SNPE). This allows us to infer eight behavioral and
biological parameters from just two aggregate series: ASFRs and the age-profile
of planned versus unplanned births. Applied to U.S. National Survey of Family
Growth cohorts and to Demographic and Health Survey cohorts from Colombia, the
Dominican Republic, and Peru, the method reproduces observed fertility
schedules and, critically, predicts out-of-sample micro-level distributions of
age at first sex, inter-birth intervals, and family-size ideals, none of which
inform the estimation step. Because the fitted model yields complete synthetic
life histories, it enables behaviorally explicit population forecasts and
supports the construction of demographic digital twins.

*Fabrizio Falasca*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper examines limitations in neural emulators and stochastic climate models, highlighting challenges in capturing responses to external perturbations and partial observations. It advocates for physically grounded strategies like coarse-graining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of current autoregressive neural models in capturing both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations in multiscale dynamical systems.

Method: Analyzes a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose limitations, constructs neural stochastic models under full and partial observation scenarios, and applies insights to a realistic climate model.

Result: Neural models with full observations perform well, but partial observations pose challenges in variable selection and parameterization. Physically grounded strategies are essential for skillful emulation.

Conclusion: Physically grounded approaches, such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations, are crucial for effective data-driven modeling of complex systems like the climate.

Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of
multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic
climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary
statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current
autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically
struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical
system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in
high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models
under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another
with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,
the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses
in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial
observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper}
variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees
of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect
fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow
dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as
coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both
conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems
like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more
realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface
temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere,
assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and
interpretability.

### [464] [Density, asymmetry and citation dynamics in scientific literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23366)
*Nathaniel Imel,Zachary Hafen*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper examines how a paper's similarity to prior research (measured by density and asymmetry metrics) affects its citation rate, finding density modestly predictive but asymmetry not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the tension between building on existing knowledge and introducing novelty in science, and how this relates to citation impact.

Method: Introduced two metrics (density and asymmetry) to measure semantic similarity, applied Bayesian hierarchical regression on ~53,000 papers across disciplines.

Result: Density modestly improves citation prediction; asymmetry does not.

Conclusion: Density of a paper's semantic neighborhood offers modest predictive value for citations, while asymmetry does not.

Abstract: Scientific behavior is often characterized by a tension between building upon
established knowledge and introducing novel ideas. Here, we investigate whether
this tension is reflected in the relationship between the similarity of a
scientific paper to previous research and its eventual citation rate. To
operationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary
metrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic
neighborhood: (1) \emph{density} ($\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed
number of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those
papers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\alpha$), defined as
the average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.
We tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its
subsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,
surveying $\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five
different document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\rho$ on
citation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors
consistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.
These results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific
literature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.
Meanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model
predictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for
linking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new
questions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the
dynamics of scientific reward.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the virtue of persistence in science, showing it can be a liability during paradigm shifts like the deep learning revolution. Analyzing 5,000 scientists, it reveals slower adaptation by established researchers led to a 'rigidity penalty,' while strategic adaptation maximized impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how persistence can hinder adaptation during scientific paradigm shifts, using the deep learning revolution as a case study.

Method: Analysis of 20-year career trajectories of 5,000 scientists in top machine learning venues, focusing on research focus, output, and citation impact.

Result: Established scientists adapted slowly, suffering a 'rigidity penalty,' while those who strategically pivoted to new trends gained the most impact.

Conclusion: Scientific breakthroughs reconfigure field power structures, with adaptability outweighing persistence during paradigm shifts.

Abstract: Persistence is often regarded as a virtue in science. In this paper, however,
we challenge this conventional view by highlighting its contextual nature,
particularly how persistence can become a liability during periods of paradigm
shift. We focus on the deep learning revolution catalyzed by AlexNet in 2012.
Analyzing the 20-year career trajectories of over 5,000 scientists who were
active in top machine learning venues during the preceding decade, we examine
how their research focus and output evolved. We first uncover a dynamic period
in which leading venues increasingly prioritized cutting-edge deep learning
developments that displaced relatively traditional statistical learning
methods. Scientists responded to these changes in markedly different ways.
Those who were previously successful or affiliated with old teams adapted more
slowly, experiencing what we term a rigidity penalty - a reluctance to embrace
new directions leading to a decline in scientific impact, as measured by
citation percentile rank. In contrast, scientists who pursued strategic
adaptation - selectively pivoting toward emerging trends while preserving weak
connections to prior expertise - reaped the greatest benefits. Taken together,
our macro- and micro-level findings show that scientific breakthroughs act as
mechanisms that reconfigure power structures within a field.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of estimating material properties from radiographic observations in shock physics, proposing a machine learning approach to infer equation of state and crush model parameters using combined low and high impact velocity data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional parameter estimation methods fail in shock physics due to radiography's inability to directly measure key variables like density. The study aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: A generative machine learning approach is introduced to produce posterior distributions of physical parameters from radiographs, validated on simulated flyer plate impact experiments.

Result: The method accurately estimates parameters, enabling precise density reconstructions in simulations, and shows robustness to noise and unseen physics.

Conclusion: The approach offers a breakthrough in material property estimation from radiographic images, even under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental
observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material
science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the
primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does
not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which
prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here
we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving
the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model
parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool
to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data
does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush
model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence
of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high
impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of
compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine
learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical
parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact
experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model
parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and
physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the
robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned
approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of
out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby
promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from
experimental radiographic images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs impact OSS development, focusing on code development, knowledge transfer, and skill development.

Method: Used a Difference-in-Differences framework with two-way fixed effects, analyzing GitHub data from Italy, France, and Portugal (88,022 users) during a ChatGPT ban.

Result: ChatGPT access increased productivity by 6.4%, knowledge sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%, with benefits varying by experience and context.

Conclusion: Strategic LLM deployment can enhance developer productivity, collaboration, and skill acquisition, benefiting OSS organizations long-term.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software
development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand
this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence
OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill
development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work
in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary
ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with
two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in
three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We
find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge
sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary
significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience
productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from
improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we
find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest
benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving
contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct
code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge
exchange among developers; dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic
understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial
implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers'
onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster
knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition,
together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.

Motivation: To address resource allocation challenges in RIS-assisted 6G wireless systems, ensuring efficient downlink transmission.

Method: A two-stage framework with BeamNet (predicts RIS phase shifts) and AllocationNet (allocates RBs), using quantization and Gumbel-softmax for discrete constraints. Active beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling.

Result: Achieves 99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, maintaining robustness under varying conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient and scalable for RIS-assisted systems, offering near-optimal performance with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless
systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA
system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised
learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS
beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes
BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which
allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active
beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To
handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and
the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training
enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves
99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and
it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based method for extracting fetal ECG (fECG) from single-channel recordings using dry textile electrodes, addressing noise and motion artifacts. The proposed Complex UNet pipeline outperforms traditional methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is essential to minimize complications. Home-based monitoring with dry textile electrodes presents challenges like noise and motion artifacts, necessitating reliable fECG extraction methods.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline using Complex UNet, a complex-valued denoising network, to process both real and imaginary components of spectrograms. This addresses phase information and improves accuracy. A new dataset simulating real-world conditions was created for validation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in fECG extraction and R-peak detection, outperforming traditional approaches on both simulated and real data.

Conclusion: This is the first effective method for extracting fECG from single-channel recordings using dry textile electrodes, advancing non-invasive, self-administered pregnancy monitoring.

Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising
potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a
promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments.
Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable
and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup
presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which
complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from
single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI
techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings,
including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo
recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure
the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based
on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches
that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and
imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and
preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against
traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in
terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our
suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate
extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the
first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using
dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully
non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

TL;DR: A study evaluates mobile phone fingertip videos for HR and RR estimation in daily life, finding traditional methods perform poorly. A 3D CNN method reduces errors significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if lab-based HR and RR estimation methods generalize to daily life using mobile phone videos.

Method: Collected a large dataset of daily life videos with ground truth labels, then proposed a 3D CNN for estimation.

Result: Traditional methods performed worse (7x for RR, 13x for HR), but the 3D CNN reduced errors by 68% (HR) and 75% (RR).

Conclusion: Deep learning, especially 3D CNNs, improves HR and RR estimation accuracy for daily life applications.

Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating
vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life
has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these
estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data
used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory
environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are
assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of
researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made
during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111
participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the
fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times
worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep
learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising
solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for
estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error
in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that
regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and
RR.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A machine learning pipeline predicts groundwater levels using climate and hydro-meteorological data, achieving high accuracy and scalability for monitoring networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Groundwater monitoring is challenging due to sparse data and delayed outputs. This paper aims to improve monitoring using machine learning.

Method: The approach uses AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework with geospatial preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.

Result: The model achieves weighted F1 scores of 0.927 (validation) and 0.67 (test) on a large French dataset.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, data-driven groundwater management, useful for early warning systems and climate adaptation.

Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies
worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data,
computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We
develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories
using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes
processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach
integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and
automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations.
Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $>$ 3,440,000 observations from
1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation
data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations
demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation
decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national
groundwater monitoring networks, enabling more responsive and data-driven water
management strategies.

TL;DR: A novel IoT-based Fall Detection as a Service (FDaaS) framework using UWB radar and FD-GPT for accurate, privacy-preserving fall detection in the elderly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns in fall detection for the growing elderly population.

Method: Service-oriented architecture with UWB radar sensors and FD-GPT for data augmentation, validated on a real dataset of elderly activities.

Result: Achieves 90.72% accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing falls from daily activities.

Conclusion: The FDaaS framework offers a reliable, privacy-conscious solution for elderly fall detection.

Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population,
projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050. However, existing methods often face
data scarcity challenges or compromise privacy. We propose a novel IoT-based
Fall Detection as a Service (FDaaS) framework to assist the elderly in living
independently and safely by accurately detecting falls. We design a
service-oriented architecture that leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors
as an IoT health-sensing service, ensuring privacy and minimal intrusion. We
address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques.
We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily
activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully
mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models
using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72%
accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular
activities of daily living.

*Konstantinos Koutras,Agorakis Bompotas,Constantinos Halkiopoulos,Athanasios Kalogeras,Christos Alexakos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper explores correlation analysis in IoT data from a smart office to optimize energy consumption predictions using fewer variables, achieving accuracy with reduced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify statistical correlations between environmental variables and energy consumption to reduce input parameters for ML prediction algorithms.

Method: Conducted 90 hypothesis tests (30 per variable pair) to analyze correlations between environmental variables and energy consumption.

Result: Found strong/semi-strong correlations with two variables and weak correlation with a third, enabling exclusion of weakly correlated variables without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: The methodology successfully reduces data input for ML predictions while maintaining accuracy, beneficial for low-resource IoT edge devices.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building
infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated
industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant
systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information.
This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data
analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network
where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this
context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data
analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low
resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data
retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office
by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research
motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables
that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for
energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of
hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables
with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were
performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed
the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental
variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed
methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak
correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

*He-Yang Xu,Hongxiang Gao,Yuwen Li,Xiu-Shen Wei,Chengyu Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper addresses Simplicity Bias (SB) in ECG models, proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method with Temporal-Frequency aware Filters and Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction, and validates it on a large dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ECG models overfit dominant patterns, missing subtle but critical cues (SB). SSL is identified as a potential solution.

Method: Proposes SSL with Temporal-Frequency aware Filters and Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction to capture dynamic ECG features and mitigate SB.

Result: The method reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three downstream tasks across six datasets.

Conclusion: SSL effectively mitigates SB in ECG analysis, with the proposed method outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic
characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform
deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised
ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking
fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity
Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but
informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence
of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while
simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate
it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL
paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)
Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features
reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,
Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation
learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG
analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million
recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream
tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces
SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released
publicly.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A quantitative framework using nonlinear dynamics and entropy metrics improves STN localization in DBS surgeries, achieving high accuracy with an Extra Trees classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current STN localization in DBS relies on subjective signal interpretation; this study aims to provide a data-driven, objective method.

Method: MER data were preprocessed, segmented, and labeled. Features from recurrence quantification, nonlinear dynamics, and entropy were extracted. Supervised classifiers were trained and evaluated.

Result: The Extra Trees classifier performed best (F1-score: 0.902, ROC AUC: 0.887). Generalization on a test set confirmed robustness (F1: 0.922, ROC AUC: 0.941).

Conclusion: Nonlinear and entropy features enhance real-time decision-making in DBS, offering a reliable alternative to subjective methods.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with
Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich
electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current
localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal
features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages
nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity
recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were
preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and
labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence
quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from
each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination
of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by
statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features
yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier
emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and
ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed
robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the
potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time,
data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

### [476] [Data Normalization Strategies for EEG Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22455)
*Dung Truong,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Optimal EEG normalization strategies vary between supervised and self-supervised learning tasks, with window-level within-channel normalization best for supervised tasks and minimal or cross-channel normalization better for SSL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of self-supervised learning in EEG applications raises questions about optimal normalization strategies, as traditional supervised approaches may not generalize.

Method: Systematic evaluation of normalization granularity (recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on supervised (age/gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive Predictive Coding) tasks using 2,836 EEG recordings.

Result: Window-level within-channel normalization works best for supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization is superior for SSL.

Conclusion: Task-specific normalization is essential, and a universal strategy does not generalize across learning paradigms, providing insights for EEG deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the
preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of
large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL)
introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from
supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new
questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity
(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on
both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive
Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836
subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal
normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms.
Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in
supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window
level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of
task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a
universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our
findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning
pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

TL;DR: A novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) combines MSK forward-dynamics with data-driven learning for accurate sEMG-based motion estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sEMG-based motion estimation methods either rely on hard-to-calibrate MSK models or lack physiological consistency, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: PENN integrates interpretable MSK forward-dynamics with residual learning using a recursive temporal structure and lightweight CNN, trained in two phases.

Result: PENN achieves lower RMSE and higher R² compared to state-of-the-art methods in experiments with six healthy subjects.

Conclusion: PENN offers a robust, physiologically consistent solution for sEMG-based motion estimation, advancing myoelectric control applications.

Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography
(sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in
rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing
sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific
musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely
data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a
novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK
forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving
physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN
employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a
lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to
robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is
designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that
PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square
error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A transformer-based model for cross-procedural skill assessment using fNIRS achieves high accuracy and generalizability with minimal preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fNIRS-based skill assessment methods are task-specific, require heavy preprocessing, and lack robustness to new conditions.

Method: An interpretable transformer model trained with self-supervised learning on minimally processed fNIRS data, validated on laparoscopic and ETI tasks.

Result: Achieves >88% accuracy, generalizes to novel procedures with few samples, and provides interpretability via channel attention.

Conclusion: The model offers robust, generalizable, and interpretable skill assessment, capturing dynamic cognitive states.

Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires
models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also
generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior
work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are
often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to
new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable
transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals
for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised
learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation
(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all
tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It
generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer
than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter
module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a
novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that
identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through
ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases
and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into
dynamic cognitive states.

TL;DR: NeuroDyGait is a framework for EEG-to-motion decoding using contrastive learning and domain modeling, achieving zero-shot prediction and superior cross-subject performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate EEG-based decoding of lower-limb motion is crucial for BCIs but faces challenges in causal predictions and variability modeling.

Method: Uses structured contrastive learning for EEG-motion alignment, multi-cycle gait reconstruction for coherence, and domain dynamic decoding for generalization.

Result: Achieves zero-shot motion prediction, superior cross-subject performance, and strong phase-detection without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Relational domain learning in NeuroDyGait enables scalable, target-free BCI deployment.

Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for
advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent
recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal,
phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject
variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a
domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured
contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The
proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic
alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait
reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and
maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization,
during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns
session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on
inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction
for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior
performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally,
it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase
supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of
relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of
BCIs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A lightweight CRLB-ratio-WF method and MBDNN are proposed for efficient DOA sensing in massive H$^2$AD MIMO systems, reducing complexity and prior knowledge reliance while improving performance, especially in low-SNR conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing a low-complexity, high-performance fusion method for target direction values in massive H$^2$AD MIMO systems with minimal prior knowledge is challenging.

Method: Proposes a CRLB-ratio-WF method using antenna number reciprocals to approximate inverse CRLB, and a multi-branch deep neural network (MBDNN) for enhanced DOA sensing.

Result: CRLB-ratio-WF matches CRLB-based methods in performance with reduced complexity. MBDNN excels in low-SNR, achieving 10x better accuracy at SNR = -15 dB.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer efficient, high-performance DOA sensing for 6G networks, with MBDNN particularly effective in low-SNR scenarios.

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential
technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a
challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of
target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of
prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse
CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time
CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while
preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network
(MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by
leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific
branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively
eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that
the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable
to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior
knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR
ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in
estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar ambiguity functions involve non-differentiable operations, limiting their use with gradient-based optimization and machine learning.

Method: The paper proposes GRAF, addressing challenges like complex-valued gradients, parallelized FFTs, numerical stability, and composability.

Result: GRAF provides a differentiable ambiguity function compatible with automatic differentiation, enabling new research in neural waveform generation and radar system optimization.

Conclusion: This work bridges classical radar signal processing with modern machine learning, offering a foundation for advanced radar waveform design.

Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design,
characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its
traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing
integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine
learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical
framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity
functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that
have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation:
proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient
computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout
cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable
operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity
Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain
mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire
pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose
differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic
differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural
network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end
optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with
modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and
demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This
work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying
modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise quantitative muscle measurements in MRIs are challenging but crucial for health outcome predictions.

Method: The study used 362 MRIs from 160 patients, with 316 for model development. The model was tested on two sets: common sequences (28 MRIs) and less frequent sequences/abnormalities (18 MRIs).

Result: Average Dice Similarity Coefficients were 88.45% for common sequences and 86.21% for challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The model is feasible for diverse MRI settings and is publicly released to support reproducible research on musculature and health.

Abstract: The quantity and quality of muscles are increasingly recognized as important
predictors of health outcomes. While MRI offers a valuable modality for such
assessments, obtaining precise quantitative measurements of musculature remains
challenging. This study aimed to develop a publicly available model for muscle
segmentation in MRIs and demonstrate its applicability across various
anatomical locations and imaging sequences. A total of 362 MRIs from 160
patients at a single tertiary center (Duke University Health System, 2016-2020)
were included, with 316 MRIs from 114 patients used for model development. The
model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common
sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and
abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise,
achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully
automated deep learning algorithm for segmenting muscles on MRI across diverse
settings. The public release of this model enables consistent, reproducible

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a hidden Markov model (HMM) to improve auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms by modeling attention's temporal structure, enhancing accuracy and responsiveness in real-time and offline settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AAD algorithms are often inaccurate for practical use despite identifying attended speakers in multi-speaker environments.

Method: Augment AAD with an HMM to model attention's temporal structure, leveraging the low likelihood of frequent attention switches.

Result: HMMs significantly improve AAD algorithms, outperforming existing postprocessing methods in accuracy and responsiveness.

Conclusion: The HMM-based method is efficient, intuitive, and applicable in real-time and offline scenarios, enhancing AAD performance.

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as
electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing
on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can
identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are
often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD
with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of
attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much
less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any
moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD
algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We
further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in
both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as
window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall
performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use
and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.

TL;DR: Top-down attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals under high competition, reducing feedforward signals of irrelevant stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how top-down attention operates under high competition, where stimuli share a receptive field with opposing modulatory goals.

Method: Examined neural signals in the visual cortex during high competition conditions with two stimuli in a shared receptive field.

Result: Top-down attention non-selectively suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant signals within 100 ms of stimuli onset.

Conclusion: Under high competition, top-down attention broadly suppresses neural signals to reduce irrelevant feedforward inputs.

Abstract: It is known that when multiple stimuli are present, top-down attention
selectively enhances the neural signal in the visual cortex for task-relevant
stimuli, but this has been tested only under conditions of minimal competition
of visual attention. Here we show during high competition, that is, two stimuli
in a shared receptive field possessing opposing modulatory goals, top-down
attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within
100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attentional
resources serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant
stimuli.

Abstract: Fixed points of recurrent neural networks can be leveraged to store and
generate information. These fixed points can be captured by the Boltzmann-Gibbs
measure, which leads to neural Langevin dynamics that can be used for sampling
and learning a real dataset. We call this type of generative model neural
Langevin machine, which is interpretable due to its analytic form of
distribution and is simple to train. Moreover, the learning process is derived
as a local asymmetric plasticity rule, bearing biological relevance. Therefore,
one can realize a continuous sampling of creative dynamics in a neural network,
mimicking an imagination process in brain circuits. This neural Langevin
machine may be another promising generative model, at least in its strength in
circuit-based sampling and biologically plausible learning rule.

### [487] [SABRE-FL: Selective and Accurate Backdoor Rejection for Federated Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22506)
*Momin Ahmad Khan,Yasra Chandio,Fatima Muhammad Anwar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Federated Prompt Learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, but SABRE-FL, a lightweight defense, effectively filters poisoned updates without needing raw client data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored security risks in Federated Prompt Learning, particularly backdoor attacks from malicious clients.

Method: Proposes SABRE-FL, an embedding-space anomaly detector trained offline to identify and filter poisoned prompt updates.

Result: SABRE-FL outperforms baselines, reducing backdoor accuracy while maintaining clean accuracy across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Robust defenses like SABRE-FL are essential for secure Federated Prompt Learning in decentralized systems.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and
privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP
across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup
remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor
attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients
inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the
global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while
still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this
vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters
poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained
offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client
data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both
theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably
identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse
datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by
significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy,
demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust
prompt learning in future federated systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phishing detection misses psychological manipulation, so this work explores fine-grained classification using LLMs.

Method: Few-shot ICL with GPT-4o-mini on SignalSpam dataset (100 human-annotated emails) to classify phishing techniques.

Result: Identified prevalent techniques (e.g., Baiting, Curiosity Appeal) with 0.76 accuracy.

Conclusion: ICL shows promise for nuanced phishing analysis and reveals attacker strategies.

Abstract: Traditional phishing detection often overlooks psychological manipulation.
This study investigates using Large Language Model (LLM) In-Context Learning
(ICL) for fine-grained classification of phishing emails based on a taxonomy of
40 manipulation techniques. Using few-shot examples with GPT-4o-mini on
real-world French phishing emails (SignalSpam), we evaluated performance
against a human-annotated test set (100 emails). The approach effectively
identifies prevalent techniques (e.g., Baiting, Curiosity Appeal, Request For
Minor Favor) with a promising accuracy of 0.76. This work demonstrates ICL's
potential for nuanced phishing analysis and provides insights into attacker
strategies.

*Anamika Lochab,Lu Yan,Patrick Pynadath,Xiangyu Zhang,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VERA, a variational inference framework, efficiently generates diverse jailbreak prompts for LLMs without re-optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify vulnerabilities in LLMs, as current approaches rely on inefficient genetic algorithms and manual curation.

Method: VERA uses variational inference to train a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts, enabling diverse prompt generation.

Result: VERA achieves strong performance across various target LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

Conclusion: VERA provides a scalable and efficient solution for jailbreaking LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic methods in adversarial settings.

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for
effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in
real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based
optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are
limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt
pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each
prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence
fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a
variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the
target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can
generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without
re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong
performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of
probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A survey on model extraction attacks and defenses for language models, categorizing attacks and defenses, proposing evaluation metrics, and identifying research gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security threats to language models from extraction attacks, which risk intellectual property and privacy.

Method: Taxonomy of attacks (functionality, training data, prompt-targeted) and defenses (model, data, prompt protection), with analysis of methodologies and evaluation metrics.

Result: Identified limitations in current approaches and proposed research directions like integrated attacks and adaptive defenses.

Conclusion: Provides a resource for protecting language models, highlighting the need for balanced security and utility.

Abstract: Model extraction attacks pose significant security threats to deployed
language models, potentially compromising intellectual property and user
privacy. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific
extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality
extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze
various attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct
querying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit
transformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into
model protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies,
evaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We
propose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and
defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language
models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current
approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated
attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with
model utility. This work serves NLP researchers, ML engineers, and security
professionals seeking to protect language models in production environments.

### [491] [General Autonomous Cybersecurity Defense: Learning Robust Policies for Dynamic Topologies and Diverse Attackers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22706)
*Arun Ramamurthy,Neil Dhir*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes General Autonomous Cybersecurity Defense (GACD) to address limitations of current systems in dynamic networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ACD systems fail in dynamic networks due to static training assumptions and lack of adaptability.

Method: Explores methods for training agents to learn generalizable policies in dynamic network environments.

Result: Proposes GACD to improve adaptability and generalization in cybersecurity defense.

Conclusion: GACD aims to enhance real-time threat detection and response in evolving network topologies.

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and
phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential
for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention.
However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the
stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios,
network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders,
system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the
adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are
trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific
topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods
for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network
environments -- general ACD (GACD).

### [492] [Kill Two Birds with One Stone! Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22722)
*Anmin Fu,Fanyu Meng,Huaibing Peng,Hua Ma,Zhi Zhang,Yifeng Zheng,Willy Susilo,Yansong Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UniGuard is a unified online detection framework for adversarial examples and backdoor attacks, leveraging trajectory signatures and LSTM for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a unified solution for detecting both adversarial examples and backdoor attacks during inference.

Method: Analyzes propagation trajectories as time-series signals, using LSTM and spectrum transformation to detect subtle adversarial signatures.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in diverse modalities, tasks, and attack scenarios, including partial backdoors and dynamic triggers.

Conclusion: UniGuard is highly effective and efficient, offering a robust solution for simultaneous detection of adversarial and backdoor threats.

Abstract: The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable
of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks.
UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have
to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them
simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial
input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in
backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign
sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.
The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of
its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be
fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due
to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation
trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation
to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are
subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness
have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and
audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model
architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks,
including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to
SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED
(IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently
demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's
strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of
attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.

### [493] [Logit-Gap Steering: Efficient Short-Suffix Jailbreaks for Aligned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24056)
*Tung-Ling Li,Hongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Logit-gap steering is a fast jailbreak framework for RLHF-aligned language models, reducing refusal-affirmation gaps efficiently with minimal model calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing jailbreak methods (like beam or gradient attacks) and improve attack success rates while maintaining coherence.

Method: Uses a forward-computable score blending gap reduction, KL penalty, and reward shift, enabling a quick "sort-sum-stop" sweep for suffix generation.

Result: Achieves 80-100% one-shot attack success, generalizes across prompts and model sizes, and exposes alignment artefacts.

Conclusion: Logit-gap steering is efficient, effective, and provides insights into safety tuning's impact on model representations.

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the
refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over
the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with
lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop"
sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of
magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix
generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints,
lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while
preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose
sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a
lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

TL;DR: The paper explores Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to enhance DDoS attack detection in imbalanced and partially labeled datasets, evaluating 13 SSL algorithms for practical efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of automating DDoS attack detection in cybersecurity, especially with class imbalance and limited labeled data.

Method: Evaluates 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms for DDoS detection in various scenarios, focusing on extreme environments.

Result: Provides insights into the effectiveness and limitations of SSL techniques for robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs).

Conclusion: SSL can improve DDoS detection in imbalanced and partially labeled datasets, aiding the design of intelligent IDSs.

Abstract: One of the most difficult challenges in cybersecurity is eliminating
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Automating this task using
artificial intelligence is a complex process due to the inherent class
imbalance and lack of sufficient labeled samples of real-world datasets. This
research investigates the use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to
improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In
this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting
DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and
shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments.
The results will offer insight into designing intelligent Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs) that are robust against class imbalance and handle partially
labeled data.

### [495] [MetaCipher: A General and Extensible Reinforcement Learning Framework for Obfuscation-Based Jailbreak Attacks on Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22557)
*Boyuan Chen,Minghao Shao,Abdul Basit,Siddharth Garg,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MetaCipher is a novel obfuscation-based jailbreak framework for LLMs, using dynamic cipher selection via reinforcement learning to evade safety measures, achieving high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms for LLMs fail against obfuscation-based attacks, which exploit LLMs' reasoning to bypass keyword or context-based defenses.

Method: Proposes MetaCipher, a modular framework with a reinforcement learning-based cipher selection mechanism, tested across diverse LLMs and tasks.

Result: Achieves 92% ASR on non-reasoning LLMs and 74% on reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MetaCipher demonstrates robustness and adaptability, posing a significant challenge to current LLM safety measures.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have exposed them to
increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Among these, obfuscation-based
attacks -- which encrypt malicious content to evade detection -- remain highly
effective. By leveraging the reasoning ability of advanced LLMs to interpret
encrypted prompts, such attacks circumvent conventional defenses that rely on
keyword detection or context filtering. These methods are very difficult to
defend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or
decode ciphered content. In this work, we propose \textbf{MetaCipher}, a novel
obfuscation-based jailbreak framework, along with a reinforcement
learning-based dynamic cipher selection mechanism that adaptively chooses
optimal encryption strategies from a cipher pool. This approach enhances
jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability across diverse task types, victim
LLMs, and safety guardrails. Our framework is modular and extensible by design,
supporting arbitrary cipher families and accommodating evolving adversarial
strategies. We complement our method with a large-scale empirical analysis of
cipher performance across multiple victim LLMs. Within as few as 10 queries,
MetaCipher achieves over 92\% attack success rate (ASR) on most recent standard
malicious prompt benchmarks against state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs, and
over 74\% ASR against reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming all existing
obfuscation-based jailbreak methods. These results highlight the long-term
robustness and adaptability of our approach, making it more resilient than
prior methods in the face of advancing safety measures.

TL;DR: A decentralized architecture for managing personal data to address privacy and security issues in centralized systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized data management poses privacy risks and lacks user control, necessitating a shift to decentralized solutions.

Method: Uses secure enclaves and federated learning for privacy-preserving data handling, enabling user-controlled sharing.

Result: The system ensures data ownership, selective sharing, and robust privacy while supporting diverse functionalities.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture offers a viable solution for secure, decentralized personal data management.

Abstract: In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized
management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security
vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information.
Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail
to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and
unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental
paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal
data across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and finance.
  This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture
that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational
credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models,
our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to
selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture's
foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure
enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and
data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local
computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while
ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a security phase exposure model using SVM and fuzzy evidential reasoning to efficiently assess encryption algorithms, addressing vulnerabilities in current protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing vulnerabilities in digital information security and inefficiencies in current encryption assessment methods drive the need for a faster, more precise solution.

Method: The authors use SVM for cipher encryption analysis and fuzzy evidential reasoning to process risk assessment data, forming a dataset with security components like contrast and homogeneity.

Result: Performance is evaluated using recall, F1 score, and accuracy, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a systematic and efficient approach to security assessment, overcoming uncertainties and processing limitations in traditional methods.

Abstract: With current advancement in hybermedia knowledges, the privacy of digital
information has developed a critical problem. To overawed the susceptibilities
of present security protocols, scholars tend to focus mainly on efforts on
alternation of current protocols. Over past decade, various proposed encoding
models have been shown insecurity, leading to main threats against significant
data. Utilizing the suitable encryption model is very vital means of guard
against various such, but algorithm is selected based on the dependency of data
which need to be secured. Moreover, testing potentiality of the security
assessment one by one to identify the best choice can take a vital time for
processing. For faster and precisive identification of assessment algorithm, we
suggest a security phase exposure model for cipher encryption technique by
invoking Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this work, we form a dataset using
usual security components like contrast, homogeneity. To overcome the
uncertainty in analysing the security and lack of ability of processing data to
a risk assessment mechanism. To overcome with such complications, this paper
proposes an assessment model for security issues using fuzzy evidential
reasoning (ER) approaches. Significantly, the model can be utilised to process
and assemble risk assessment data on various aspects in systematic ways. To
estimate the performance of our framework, we have various analyses like,
recall, F1 score and accuracy.

TL;DR: A survey on threats in LLM-agent ecosystems, introducing a unified threat model, categorizing attacks, and suggesting future research directions for defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of LLM-agent capabilities has led to security vulnerabilities due to inadequate discovery mechanisms and security practices, necessitating a comprehensive threat model.

Method: The paper introduces a unified threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, categorizing attacks into four domains (Input Manipulation, Model Compromise, System and Privacy Attacks, Protocol Vulnerabilities), and evaluates defenses.

Result: Over thirty attack techniques are cataloged, with assessments of real-world feasibility and existing defenses. Key open challenges and future research directions are identified.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundational reference for designing robust defenses and best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows, addressing critical security gaps.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured
function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for
real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration.
Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent
protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting
in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we
introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems,
spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary
capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack
techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains:
Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal
adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level
backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies),
System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership
inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol
Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent
Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess
real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat
taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such
as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic
provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and
achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work
provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense
mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MH-AutoML is a domain-specific AutoML framework for Android malware detection, offering transparency, interpretability, and better recall rates compared to existing AutoML solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AutoML solutions lack transparency, interpretability, and traceability, which are critical for cybersecurity applications like malware detection.

Method: MH-AutoML automates the ML pipeline (data preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning) and includes interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking features.

Result: MH-AutoML outperforms seven AutoML frameworks in recall rates while maintaining computational efficiency and providing transparency.

Conclusion: MH-AutoML is a suitable solution for Android malware detection, balancing performance and explainability.

Abstract: Malware detection in Android systems requires both cybersecurity expertise
and machine learning (ML) techniques. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has
emerged as an approach to simplify ML development by reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. However, current AutoML solutions typically operate as
black-box systems with limited transparency, interpretability, and experiment
traceability. To address these limitations, we present MH-AutoML, a
domain-specific framework for Android malware detection. MH-AutoML automates
the entire ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering,
algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The framework incorporates
capabilities for interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking that are
often missing in general-purpose solutions. In this study, we compare MH-AutoML
against seven established AutoML frameworks: Auto-Sklearn, AutoGluon, TPOT,
HyperGBM, Auto-PyTorch, LightAutoML, and MLJAR. Results show that MH-AutoML
achieves better recall rates while providing more transparency and control. The
framework maintains computational efficiency comparable to other solutions,
making it suitable for cybersecurity applications where both performance and
explainability matter.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Combining QI and FedGT improves misbehaviour detection and contribution evaluation in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure aggregation in federated learning complicates detecting malicious clients and evaluating contributions. QI and FedGT address these but have limitations.

Method: Combines QI (for contribution evaluation) and FedGT (for misbehaviour detection) to leverage their strengths.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in both misbehaviour detection and contribution evaluation.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach outperforms standalone QI or FedGT, enhancing federated learning security and fairness.

Abstract: Federated learning with secure aggregation enables private and collaborative
learning from decentralised data without leaking sensitive client information.
However, secure aggregation also complicates the detection of malicious client
behaviour and the evaluation of individual client contributions to the
learning. To address these challenges, QI (Pejo et al.) and FedGT (Xhemrishi et
al.) were proposed for contribution evaluation (CE) and misbehaviour detection
(MD), respectively. QI, however, lacks adequate MD accuracy due to its reliance
on the random selection of clients in each training round, while FedGT lacks
the CE ability. In this work, we combine the strengths of QI and FedGT to
achieve both robust MD and accurate CE. Our experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to using either method independently.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes semantic privacy risks in LLMs, proposing a lifecycle framework to identify threats and evaluate defenses, revealing gaps in protection against contextual inference and latent leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional privacy measures fail to protect implicit or inferable information in LLMs, necessitating a focus on semantic privacy.

Method: A lifecycle-centric framework categorizes attack vectors and assesses defenses like differential privacy and embedding encryption.

Result: Critical gaps exist in semantic-level protection, particularly against contextual inference and latent representation leakage.

Conclusion: Future research should address challenges like quantifying semantic leakage and balancing privacy with generation quality.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting
information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as
semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a
lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across
input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We
categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as
differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning,
address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level
protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation
leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying
semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification
with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This
work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware
privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

Conclusion: The gMBA framework effectively bridges the gap in MBA deobfuscation by incorporating semantic guidance.

Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation protects intellectual property by
converting programs into forms that are more complex to analyze. However, MBA
has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and
cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods
often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their
internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table,
which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an
expression's behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table
is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all
possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided
MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural
encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression
semantics significantly improves performance and highlights the importance of
internal semantic expressions in recovering obfuscated code to its original
form.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel methodology for generating synthetic, differentially-private API outputs to study Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs, focusing on Google Chrome's Topics API, with an open-source dataset release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical study of privacy properties in Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is limited due to lack of public data. Privacy concerns prevent real data release, necessitating synthetic alternatives.

Method: Developed a method to compute differentially-private statistics, design a parameterized distribution matching these statistics, and generate synthetic data from this distribution.

Result: Created a realistic, differentially-private dataset mimicking the Topics API's re-identification risk, with strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The open-source dataset enables external research, fostering transparency in Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs' privacy properties.

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an
area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry,
and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is
hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of
the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset
consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the
general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API
outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and
provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads
APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a
methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches
the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of
differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of
private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of
differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over
time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces
and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.
Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset
obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to
analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic
large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering
transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

*David Bálik,Martin Jureček,Mark Stamp*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel malware dataset labeled at type and family levels was created, achieving high accuracy in classification tasks using machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of malware classification by developing a labeled dataset and evaluating performance across different classification tasks.

Method: Collected raw binaries from sources like VirusShare, labeled them with family and type information, and processed them using static analysis for feature extraction. Evaluated using Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM.

Result: High accuracy in binary classification (up to 98.98%), strong performance with limited data (up to 98.66%), and notable results in interclass and multiclass tasks (up to 97.5% and 81.1%, respectively).

Conclusion: The dataset and methods provide a robust foundation for fine-grained malware classification, balancing accuracy and computational cost.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of malware classification using machine
learning by developing a novel dataset labeled at both the malware type and
family levels. Raw binaries were collected from sources such as VirusShare, VX
Underground, and MalwareBazaar, and subsequently labeled with family
information parsed from binary names and type-level labels integrated from
ClarAVy. The dataset includes 14 malware types and 17 malware families, and was
processed using a unified feature extraction pipeline based on static analysis,
particularly extracting features from Portable Executable headers, to support
advanced classification tasks. The evaluation was focused on three key
classification tasks. In the binary classification of malware versus benign
samples, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy on the full datasets,
reaching 98.5% for type-based detection and 98.98% for family-based detection.
When using truncated datasets of 1,000 samples to assess performance under
limited data conditions, both models still performed strongly, achieving 97.6%
for type-based detection and 98.66% for family-based detection. For interclass
classification, which distinguishes between malware types or families, the
models reached up to 97.5% accuracy on type-level tasks and up to 93.7% on
family-level tasks. In the multiclass classification setting, which assigns
samples to the correct type or family, SVM achieved 81.1% accuracy on type
labels, while Random Forest and XGBoost reached approximately 73.4% on family
labels. The results highlight practical trade-offs between accuracy and
computational cost, and demonstrate that labeling at both the type and family
levels enables more fine-grained and insightful malware classification. The
work establishes a robust foundation for future research on advanced malware
detection and classification.

### [506] [Teaching a Language Model to Speak the Language of Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23394)
*Simeon Emanuilov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A methodology for adapting multilingual language models to enable robust tool use in non-English languages, demonstrated with Bulgarian, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multilingual models lack reliable tool-use capabilities in non-English languages, especially lower-resource ones like Bulgarian.

Method: Continued training of BgGPT models on a bilingual dataset of function-calling examples, introducing TUCAN for improved tool use.

Result: TUCAN achieves up to 28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy and produces clean, parsable outputs.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical approach for extending tool-augmented capabilities to non-English languages, with released resources for replication.

Abstract: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical
language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable
tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art
multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating
the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language
confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a
methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in
any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves
continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a
novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support
standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research
introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to
28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while
preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian
benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready
response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the
verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation
framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages.
This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented
capabilities beyond English-centric systems.

*Pedro R. Pires,Tiago A. Almeida*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Interact2Vec is a neural network-based model for learning user and item embeddings using only implicit feedback, achieving competitive performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems face challenges like high data dimensionality and sparseness. Existing solutions often rely on complex architectures or unavailable content data.

Method: Interact2Vec learns embeddings via neural networks, optimizing training with NLP-inspired strategies, and evaluates extrinsic (recommendation quality) and intrinsic (embedding similarity) performance.

Result: Interact2Vec ranked second or third in 30% of datasets, reduced training time by 274%, and showed promise in embedding quality.

Conclusion: Interact2Vec is efficient and effective, especially in resource-scarce scenarios, for learning user and item embeddings simultaneously.

Abstract: Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in
popularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues,
such as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items
as low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading
solution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches
rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be
available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model
that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while
demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies
that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training
phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted
regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we
benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a
top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms.
The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30\% of the datasets,
being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient
with an average training time reduction of 274\% compared to other
embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the
embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec
can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an
excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing
resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and
efficiently.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal short video recommendation system using MMGCN, outperforming baseline models in personalized recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance live broadcast engagement by integrating multi-modal data and user preferences for personalized recommendations.

Method: Uses Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with hybrid filtering (collaborative and content-based) on user interaction, video content, and contextual data.

Result: MMGCN outperforms DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, achieving F1 scores of 0.574 (Kwai), 0.506 (TikTok), and 0.197 (MovieLens).

Conclusion: Multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches are key to improving recommender systems for live broadcast platforms.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing
live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system
that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user
preferences. In order to provide personalized recommendations tailored to
individual interests, the proposed system takes into account user interaction
data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a
hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
techniques, the system is able to capture nuanced relationships between users,
video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to
baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the
proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the
proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse
user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting
in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1
score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and
user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role
they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live
broadcast platforms.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MTORL is a multi-task offline RL model addressing challenges in sparse advertising scenarios by combining causal state encoding, MDP framework, and multi-task learning for channel recommendation and budget allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline RL methods struggle with overestimation, distributional shifts, and budget constraints in sparse advertising scenarios.

Method: Proposes MTORL with a causal state encoder, MDP framework, and multi-task learning to handle user interests, temporal dependencies, and task integration.

Result: MTORL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in offline and online experiments.

Conclusion: MTORL effectively addresses key challenges in advertising, offering a robust solution for recommendation and budget allocation.

Abstract: Online advertising in recommendation platforms has gained significant
attention, with a predominant focus on channel recommendation and budget
allocation strategies. However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL)
methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising
scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and
overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a
novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we
establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of
advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user
interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through
conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to
enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal
states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards,
simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation.
Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks
into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online
environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

*Jaime Hieu Do,Trung-Hoang Le,Hady W. Lauw*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoVE, a framework for personalized sequential recommendations by combining short- and long-term user preferences using specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of leveraging both immediate and historical user behavior for better recommendations in digital platforms.

Method: Proposes CoVE, which dynamically integrates short- and long-term preferences through variant expert models.

Result: Empirical studies confirm the impact of both preference types, and CoVE shows improved recommendation performance.

Conclusion: CoVE effectively combines short- and long-term preferences, enhancing recommendation accuracy and relevance.

Abstract: In the online digital realm, recommendation systems are ubiquitous and play a
crucial role in enhancing user experience. These systems leverage user
preferences to provide personalized recommendations, thereby helping users
navigate through the paradox of choice. This work focuses on personalized
sequential recommendation, where the system considers not only a user's
immediate, evolving session context, but also their cumulative historical
behavior to provide highly relevant and timely recommendations. Through an
empirical study conducted on diverse real-world datasets, we have observed and
quantified the existence and impact of both short-term (immediate and
transient) and long-term (enduring and stable) preferences on users' historical
interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that combines
short- and long-term preferences to enhance recommendation performance, namely
Compositions of Variant Experts (CoVE). This novel framework dynamically
integrates short- and long-term preferences through the use of different
specialized recommendation models (i.e., experts). Extensive experiments
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods and ablation studies further
investigate the impact of variant expert types.

*Norman Knyazev,Harrie Oosterhuis*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLPL, a method for joint optimization of document ordering and presentation lengths in rankings, addressing gaps in traditional Learning to Rank (LTR) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LTR methods assume uniform document presentation, but user perception of relevance changes with varying presentation formats and lengths. This gap is addressed by proposing a solution for variable presentation length ranking.

Method: The paper proposes VLPL, a Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient estimation method, for jointly optimizing document ordering and presentation lengths.

Result: VLPL effectively balances document exposure and attractiveness, outperforming fixed-length models. Simple length-aware methods also show significant improvements.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges and importance of integrating document presentation with LTR, demonstrating VLPL's effectiveness in variable-length ranking tasks.

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) methods generally assume that each document in a top-K
ranking is presented in an equal format. However, previous work has shown that
users' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,
allocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual
or image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect
attention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when
scrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a
fixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been
addressed by existing LTR methods.
  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking
task, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation
length is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show
that this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability
ranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem
cannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.
  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient
estimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.
Our semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the
expected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best
performance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that
even simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance
improvements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and
empirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining
document presentation with LTR.

the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate
algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial
needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on
framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining
realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module
empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the
customers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for
retailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and
provide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results
of our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive
system highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.

TL;DR: Pix2G is a lightweight method for real-time generation of 3D scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps, enabling autonomous exploration on resource-constrained robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human-readable 2D maps (BIM) and robot 3D maps for efficient human-robot cooperation in high-risk tasks.

Method: Pix2G processes image pixels and LiDAR maps on CPU-only hardware to produce de-noised 2D maps and segmented 3D pointclouds, connected via a multi-layer graph.

Result: Successfully tested on NASA JPL NeBula-Spot robot for real-time exploration of cluttered environments like garages and offices.

Conclusion: Pix2G provides a practical solution for real-time scene graph generation, enhancing autonomous robot exploration in constrained settings.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage
and urban office like environments in real-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with complex, real-time driving scenarios, needing better focus on critical objects for clear explanations.

Method: Proposes an Attention Map Generator to highlight key objects in driving scenarios, improving model focus and explanation relevance.

Result: Evaluations on DRAMA dataset show higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores, indicating better explanation quality.

Conclusion: Targeted attention mechanisms in vision-language models can significantly improve explainability in autonomous driving.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT
architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for
emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial.
To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared
to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted
attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in
real-time autonomous driving.

TL;DR: SAD-RL integrates hierarchical RL in a scenario-based environment to improve decision-making for automated driving, achieving safe and efficient behavior in diverse situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches lack generalizability and efficiency for complex driving tasks.

Method: SAD-RL uses a hierarchical policy with high-level maneuver selection and low-level execution in a scenario-based environment.

Result: Agents trained with SAD-RL exhibit safe behavior in both easy and challenging situations.

Conclusion: Hierarchical RL and scenario diversity are crucial for effective automated driving decision-making.

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly
introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our
experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our
ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential
for achieving these results.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate mode collapse in multimodal prediction models for autonomous vehicles, introducing metrics for mode collapse, correctness, and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models often overlook interaction diversity and lack metrics to evaluate mode collapse, posing safety risks.

Method: The authors introduce a novel evaluation framework with new metrics and test four multi-agent trajectory prediction models.

Result: Mode collapse occurs, and models sometimes fail to predict correct interaction modes even near critical events.

Conclusion: The framework aims to improve prediction model consistency and accuracy, enhancing autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Result: The competition attracted 64 teams, produced top solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3, and provided insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning.

Conclusion: The challenge successfully advanced research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies, with findings supporting future work in the field.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is an emerging frontier in
robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason,
and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown
strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for
handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and
tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin
Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on
the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot
platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1,
Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled
17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based
scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants,
producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating
valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report
outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key
findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and
generalizable bimanual manipulation policies. The Challenge Webpage is

### [518] [MGPRL: Distributed Multi-Gaussian Processes for Wi-Fi-based Multi-Robot Relative Localization in Large Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23514)
*Sai Krishna Ghanta,Ramviyas Parasuraman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MGPRL is a distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using Wi-Fi AP convex hulls, offering high accuracy and efficiency without costly sensors or pre-calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing methods (high computational overhead, dependency on costly/short-range sensors) for multi-robot relative localization in GPS-denied environments.

Method: Uses co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for RSSI field prediction, uncertainty-aware multi-AP localization, and weighted convex hull-based alignment for robust pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and computational efficiency, validated via ROS simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: MGPRL is a scalable, resource-efficient solution for multi-robot relative localization, leveraging widely available Wi-Fi RSSI measurements.

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot
relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like
cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high
computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint
environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel
distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

### [519] [Online Human Action Detection during Escorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23573)
*Siddhartha Mondal,Avik Mitra,Chayan Sarkar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel neural network architecture is proposed for real-time person re-identification and action prediction to improve robotic escorting in crowded environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current escorting robots fail in crowded settings due to limited understanding of human movement dynamics and lack of datasets for human action detection during escorting.

Method: The paper introduces a neural network that performs both person re-identification and action prediction in real-time, allowing dynamic speed adjustment.

Result: The proposed system outperforms baselines in efficiency and effectiveness, enhancing robotic escorting services.

Conclusion: The new architecture significantly improves escorting robots' performance in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

### [520] [PAC Bench: Do Foundation Models Understand Prerequisites for Executing Manipulation Policies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23725)
*Atharva Gundawar,Som Sagar,Ransalu Senanayake*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PAC Bench evaluates VLMs' understanding of Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) for reliable robot manipulation, revealing significant gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack verified understanding of low-level physical prerequisites (e.g., object properties, affordances, constraints) for reliable robot manipulation.

Method: Introduces PAC Bench, a benchmark with 30,000+ annotations across real-world images, humanoid-view scenarios, and simulated tasks to evaluate VLMs on PAC.

Result: Current VLMs show significant gaps in grasping fundamental physical concepts, limiting their reliability for robot manipulation.

Conclusion: PAC Bench highlights the need for more robust, physically grounded VLMs and provides a standardized benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

### [521] [Multi-Timescale Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Unified Behavior and Control of Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23771)
*Guizhe Jin,Zhuoren Li,Bo Leng,Ran Yu,Lu Xiong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving to address the limitations of traditional RL methods, improving driving efficiency, consistency, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based autonomous driving methods often lack structured policy design, leading to fluctuating behavior or suboptimal control.

Method: A hierarchical RL policy is introduced, combining high-level motion guidance and low-level control commands, with hybrid actions and a safety mechanism.

Result: The approach enhances performance in simulated and real-world highway scenarios, boosting efficiency, consistency, and safety.

Conclusion: The hierarchical RL framework effectively addresses multi-timescale challenges in autonomous driving, offering a robust solution.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

### [522] [Adapt Your Body: Mitigating Proprioception Shifts in Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23944)
*Fuhang Kuang,Jiacheng You,Yingdong Hu,Tong Zhang,Chuan Wen,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the proprioception shift problem in imitation learning for robotics by proposing a domain adaptation framework using Wasserstein distance to align training and deployment distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprioceptive states degrade imitation learning performance due to distribution shifts between training and deployment.

Method: A domain adaptation framework uses Wasserstein distance to quantify and minimize the discrepancy between expert and rollout proprioceptive states by adding noise proportional to the distance.

Result: The method outperforms naive solutions and other baselines, enabling robust use of proprioception in robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates proprioception shift, enhancing imitation learning performance in robotics.

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

*Zhenghao Peng,Yuxin Liu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: InfGen is a transformer-based framework for generating dynamic, long-horizon traffic scenarios, enabling realistic and adaptive simulations for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulation methods are limited by static or log-replay data, lacking dynamic and evolving scenarios.

Method: InfGen uses a transformer model to autoregressively generate agent states and trajectories, representing scenes as token sequences.

Result: InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors, enhancing reinforcement learning policy training.

Conclusion: InfGen serves as a high-fidelity simulation tool for autonomous driving, improving robustness and generalization in trained policies.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and
evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven
simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting
their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent
populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

TL;DR: The paper extends Deep Hedging by using deep neural networks for CVaR minimization in portfolio tail-risk hedging, showing robust results in realistic market simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve tail-risk hedging in portfolios by leveraging deep learning for convex-risk minimization under real-world constraints.

Method: Uses deep neural networks to parameterize CVaR/ES, tested on crisis-era bootstrap market simulators with practical constraints like transaction costs and liquidity.

Result: Achieves significant 99% CVaR reduction and provides insights into strategy adaptation in realistic markets.

Conclusion: The framework is robust and operationally viable, offering practical solutions for friction-aware hedging.

Abstract: Extending Buehler et al.'s 2019 Deep Hedging paradigm, we innovatively employ
deep neural networks to parameterize convex-risk minimization (CVaR/ES) for the
portfolio tail-risk hedging problem. Through comprehensive numerical
experiments on crisis-era bootstrap market simulators -- customizable with
transaction costs, risk budgets, liquidity constraints, and market impact --
our end-to-end framework not only achieves significant one-day 99% CVaR
reduction but also yields practical insights into friction-aware strategy
adaptation, demonstrating robustness and operational viability in realistic
markets.

### [525] [Can We Reliably Predict the Fed's Next Move? A Multi-Modal Approach to U.S. Monetary Policy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22763)
*Fiona Xiao Jingyi,Lili Liu*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining structured economic data and unstructured Fed texts outperform unimodal methods for forecasting U.S. federal funds rate shifts, achieving a test AUC of 0.83.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting central bank policy decisions is challenging but crucial for risk management. Traditional methods miss forward-looking cues in central bank communications.

Method: Multi-modal framework comparing machine learning, transformer models, and deep learning, integrating structured data with textual signals from Fed communications.

Result: Hybrid models (e.g., TF-IDF + economic indicators in XGBoost) outperform unimodal baselines (AUC 0.83). FinBERT sentiment features help ranking but not classification.

Conclusion: Integrating textual and structured data transparently improves accuracy and interpretability, offering actionable insights for policy forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting central bank policy decisions remains a persistent challenge for
investors, financial institutions, and policymakers due to the wide-reaching
impact of monetary actions. In particular, anticipating shifts in the U.S.
federal funds rate is vital for risk management and trading strategies.
Traditional methods relying only on structured macroeconomic indicators often
fall short in capturing the forward-looking cues embedded in central bank
communications.
  This study examines whether predictive accuracy can be enhanced by
integrating structured data with unstructured textual signals from Federal
Reserve communications. We adopt a multi-modal framework, comparing traditional
machine learning models, transformer-based language models, and deep learning
architectures in both unimodal and hybrid settings.
  Our results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal
baselines. The best performance is achieved by combining TF-IDF features of
FOMC texts with economic indicators in an XGBoost classifier, reaching a test
AUC of 0.83. FinBERT-based sentiment features marginally improve ranking but
perform worse in classification, especially under class imbalance. SHAP
analysis reveals that sparse, interpretable features align more closely with
policy-relevant signals.
  These findings underscore the importance of integrating textual and
structured signals transparently. For monetary policy forecasting, simpler
hybrid models can offer both accuracy and interpretability, delivering
actionable insights for researchers and decision-makers.

*Mustafa Demir,Jacob Miratsky,Jonathan Nguyen,Chun Kit Chan,Punya Mishra,Abhishek Singharoy*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores how an AI tutor teammate affects student curiosity and learning in molecular dynamics tasks, showing improved engagement and performance when AI triggers curiosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI can stimulate and sustain student curiosity and enhance learning effectiveness in interactive molecular dynamics tasks.

Method: A mixed-methods design with 11 high school students, using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm to adjust AI behavior dynamically. Tasks involved molecular visualization and calculations, with performance measured via observation, recordings, and CRQA metrics.

Result: High-performing teams showed better task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. AI curiosity-triggering led to advanced questions and dynamic synchronization in interactions.

Conclusion: The AI tutor teammate effectively sustains engagement and epistemic curiosity, demonstrating potential as an adaptive educational tool.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of an Artificial Intelligence tutor teammate
(AI) on student curiosity-driven engagement and learning effectiveness during
Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) tasks on the Visual Molecular Dynamics
platform. It explores the role of the AI's curiosity-triggering and response
behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the
frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further
assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery
curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment.
Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI
tutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a
mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students
participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and
calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period. Team
performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas
team communication was measured by question complexity and AI's
curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross Recurrence Quantification
Analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were
linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior
task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced
questions were associated with AI curiosity-triggering, indicating heightened
engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic
synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive
engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that
the AI's dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide
adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement and epistemic curiosity.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: LLMs can improve harm reduction info for PWUD but require ethical and contextual design to be effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online channels fail PWUD due to adaptability, accessibility, and stigma issues. LLMs offer potential but need responsible design.

Method: Qualitative workshop with stakeholders (academics, practitioners, community moderators) to explore LLM use cases and design considerations.

Result: LLMs can reduce barriers (responsive, multilingual, less stigmatizing) but face challenges in ethics, context, communication, and boundaries.

Conclusion: Collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD is key to developing safe, helpful, and responsibly governed LLM systems for harm reduction.

Abstract: Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly
impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online
channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations
in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large
Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information
provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored
and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can
be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a
qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm
reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM
capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design
considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing
information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and
potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent
upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction
principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and
clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways
emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM
systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes
empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the
responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction
ecosystem.

### [528] [Against 'softmaxing' culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22968)
*Daniel Mwesigwa*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI models homogenize culture, termed 'softmaxing culture.' Current evaluation methods (ML/HCI) are limited. Proposed shifts: ask 'when is culture?' and situate universals in relation to particulars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the homogenization of culture by AI models and the limitations of current evaluation approaches.

Method: Proposes conceptual shifts: focus on 'when is culture?' and relate cultural universals to particulars.

Result: Current evaluations are inadequate; new approaches are needed to address cultural complexity.

Conclusion: Evaluation methods must evolve to better capture cultural nuances beyond technical metrics.

Abstract: AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of "culture" are showing the myriad
ways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging
out rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this
phenomenon "softmaxing culture," and it is one of the fundamental challenges
facing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of
culture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.
This position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer
interaction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key
shifts. First, instead of asking "what is culture?" at the start of system
evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: "when is culture?" Second,
while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the
challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to
their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation
approaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more
responsive to the complexities of culture.

*Yuchen Zhou,Jiamin Wu,Zichen Ren,Zhouheng Yao,Weiheng Lu,Kunyu Peng,Qihao Zheng,Chunfeng Song,Wanli Ouyang,Chao Gou*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: CSBrain is a cross-scale spatiotemporal foundation model for EEG decoding, outperforming existing methods by capturing diverse neural activity patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG foundation models ignore the cross-scale spatiotemporal structure of neural activity, leading to suboptimal representations and weak generalization.

Method: CSBrain introduces Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST) and Structured Sparse Attention (SSA) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture dependencies.

Result: CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and foundation model baselines on 11 EEG tasks across 16 datasets.

Conclusion: Cross-scale modeling is a key inductive bias, and CSBrain serves as a robust backbone for future brain-AI research.

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in
cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While
recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified
architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense
modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core
property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task
patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to
slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed
interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and
weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain
foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i)
Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale
features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into
compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which
captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity
while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to
progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks
across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and
foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a
key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future
brain-AI research.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MuseCogNet, a joint learning framework combining self-supervised and supervised training, improves EEG signal decoding for cognitive load detection in portable EEG devices like Muse headbands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Portable EEG devices face challenges with signal non-stationarity, limiting data fidelity and decoding accuracy.

Method: Proposes MuseCogNet, integrating self-supervised reconstruction loss (average pooling) and supervised cross-entropy loss to capture neurophysiological patterns and task-specific discriminants.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a Muse dataset, enhancing neurocognitive monitoring in real-world settings.

Conclusion: MuseCogNet bridges the gap between portability and performance in EEG-based cognitive load detection.

Abstract: Portable and wearable consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices,
like Muse headbands, offer unprecedented mobility for daily brain-computer
interface (BCI) applications, including cognitive load detection. However, the
exacerbated non-stationarity in portable EEG signals constrains data fidelity
and decoding accuracy, creating a fundamental trade-off between portability and
performance. To mitigate such limitation, we propose MuseCogNet (Muse-based
Cognitive Network), a unified joint learning framework integrating
self-supervised and supervised training paradigms. In particular, we introduce
an EEG-grounded self-supervised reconstruction loss based on average pooling to
capture robust neurophysiological patterns, while cross-entropy loss refines
task-specific cognitive discriminants. This joint learning framework resembles
the bottom-up and top-down attention in humans, enabling MuseCogNet to
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available Muse
dataset and establish an implementable pathway for neurocognitive monitoring in
ecological settings.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Interactive Reasoning improves LLM output by organizing CoT content hierarchically, enabling user feedback and oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verbose and disorganized CoT outputs in LLMs lack user feedback opportunities, hindering clarity and customization.

Method: Introduces Interactive Reasoning, visualized as a topic hierarchy, implemented in Hippo for AI-assisted decision-making.

Result: User study shows faster error identification, efficient model steering, and better understanding of model reasoning.

Conclusion: Interactive Reasoning enhances LLM outputs by integrating user oversight into reasoning processes.

Abstract: The output quality of large language models (LLMs) can be improved via
"reasoning": generating segments of chain-of-thought (CoT) content to further
condition the model prior to producing user-facing output. While these chains
contain valuable information, they are verbose and lack explicit organization,
making them tedious to review. Moreover, they lack opportunities for user
feedback, such as to remove unwanted considerations, add desired ones, or
clarify unclear assumptions. We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction
design that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and
enables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in
Hippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain
trade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive
reasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous
generations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and
better understand both model reasoning and model outputs. Our work contributes
to a new paradigm that incorporates user oversight into LLM reasoning
processes.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI decision-support systems impact domain-specific autonomy, focusing on skilled competence and authentic value-formation, and proposes design patterns to preserve autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy, particularly in professional, skill-based, and personal contexts.

Method: Analyzes prior work and empirical cases in medical, financial, and educational domains, identifying risks like unreliable failure indicators and unconscious value shifts.

Result: Demonstrates how AI can erode domain-specific autonomy and proposes a framework with design patterns (e.g., role specification, defeater mechanisms) to mitigate this.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical guidance for designing AI systems that enhance human agency in specialized domains.

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of
professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has
examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on
domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within
defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI
decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy:
skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain)
and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant
values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing
empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we
demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential
for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both
immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for
autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical
design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of
defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help
maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This
framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance
rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

### [533] [The Impact of AI on Educational Assessment: A Framework for Constructive Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23815)
*Patrick Stokkink*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI, especially LLMs, impacts education and assessment, advocating for aligned learning objectives and unbiased guidelines for AI use in assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI by students challenges the validity of current assessment methods, necessitating adaptation in education.

Method: The study uses Constructive Alignment theory and Bloom's taxonomy to analyze AI's impact on learning objectives and proposes guidelines for unbiased assessment.

Result: AI affects learning objectives differently, and lecturer bias on AI use in assessments is linked to their familiarity with AI. Structured guidelines and training are recommended.

Conclusion: Education must adapt to AI by aligning assessments with learning objectives, providing staff training, and implementing structured guidelines to mitigate bias.

Abstract: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large
Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models
are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current
forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and
comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in
Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning
objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom
levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.
Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment
should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.
  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be
adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which
lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a
lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.
To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty
level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that
teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI
tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

TL;DR: A deep learning model using eye-tracking data achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity in distinguishing MCI from healthy controls, comparable to similar studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising global prevalence of dementia necessitates scalable diagnostic tools, with MCI as a key focus.

Method: A modified VTNet model analyzed eye-tracking data (time series, spatial data, scan paths, heatmaps) from 44 participants performing a visual memory task.

Result: The model achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity, comparable to similar studies despite challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The study supports automated MCI diagnostics; future work should refine the model and standardize tasks.

Abstract: The global prevalence of dementia is projected to double by 2050,
highlighting the urgent need for scalable diagnostic tools. This study utilizes
digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes
to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was
trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who
performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial
data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat
maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters
such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model
performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps,
achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more
challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a
less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an
Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity).
These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for
MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized
long-term visual memory task.

*Shi Jie Yu*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores lower bounds for estimating the trace of matrix functions using Hutchinson's method and Block Krylov techniques, linking Krylov steps to polynomial approximation degrees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical limits of trace estimation methods, particularly for functions like $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$, and their connection to polynomial approximation.

Method: Uses Hutchinson's method with Block Krylov subspaces to approximate matrix-vector products, analyzing polynomial approximations of scalar equivalents.

Result: Derives upper bounds on Krylov steps for specific functions and lower limits on queries for trace estimation, especially for Wishart matrices.

Conclusion: The study connects Krylov method steps to polynomial approximation degrees, revealing fundamental limits in trace estimation costs.

Abstract: This paper studies theoretical lower bounds for estimating the trace of a
matrix function, $\text{tr}(f(A))$, focusing on methods that use Hutchinson's
method along with Block Krylov techniques. These methods work by approximating
matrix-vector products like $f(A)V$ using a Block Krylov subspace. This is
closely related to approximating functions with polynomials. We derive
theoretical upper bounds on how many Krylov steps are needed for functions such
as $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$ by analyzing the upper bounds from the polynomial
approximation of their scalar equivalent. In addition, we also develop lower
limits on the number of queries needed for trace estimation, specifically for
$\text{tr}(W^{-p})$ where $W$ is a Wishart matrix. Our study clarifies the
connection between the number of steps in Block Krylov methods and the degree
of the polynomial used for approximation. This links the total cost of trace
estimation to basic limits in polynomial approximation and how much information
is needed for the computation.

*Max Lovig,Tianhao Wang,Zhou Fan*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores universality in non-separable AMP algorithms, identifying conditions like Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for universal state evolution beyond Gaussian data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend mean-field characterizations of AMP algorithms to non-separable dynamics and non-Gaussian data, addressing a gap in current theory.

Method: Identifies BCP for polynomial non-linearities and BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP, demonstrating applicability to common non-separable cases.

Result: Shows universality of state evolution for AMP with BCP-approximable non-linearities, including local/spectral denoisers and composed functions.

Conclusion: The work broadens universality guarantees for AMP algorithms, enabling precise analysis of non-separable dynamics in diverse statistical applications.

Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including
Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent,
and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning
dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities
have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy
a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution.
However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have
largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP
algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial
non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their
representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for
matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of
BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal
guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable
non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral
denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with
generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP
algorithms employing these non-linearities.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies identity-testing and sampling for mixtures of distributions satisfying approximate tensorization of entropy (ATE), showing fast mixing of Glauber dynamics and efficient identity-testers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of identity-testing and sampling for mixtures of distributions that do not satisfy ATE but are mixtures of those that do.

Method: 1. Fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization for mixtures of distributions satisfying modified log-Sobolev inequalities. 2. Efficient identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions in the coordinate-conditional sampling access model.

Result: 1. Optimal sample complexity for fast mixing of Glauber dynamics. 2. Efficient identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions, simplifying and improving prior work.

Conclusion: The work extends and improves upon existing results, providing efficient methods for sampling and testing mixtures of ATE distributions.

Abstract: Certain tasks in high-dimensional statistics become easier when the
underlying distribution satisfies a local-to-global property called approximate
tensorization of entropy (ATE). For example, the Glauber dynamics Markov chain
of an ATE distribution mixes fast and can produce approximate samples in a
small amount of time, since such a distribution satisfies a modified
log-Sobolev inequality. Moreover, identity-testing for an ATE distribution
requires few samples if the tester is given coordinate conditional access to
the unknown distribution, as shown by Blanca, Chen, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and
Vigoda (COLT 2023).
  A natural class of distributions that do not satisfy ATE consists of mixtures
of (few) distributions that do satisfy ATE. We study the complexity of
identity-testing and sampling for these distributions. Our main results are the
following:
  1. We show fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization,
with optimal sample complexity, for mixtures of distributions satisfying
modified log-Sobolev inequalities. This extends work of Huang, Koehler, Lee,
Mohanty, Rajaraman, Vuong, and Wu (STOC 2025, COLT 2025) for mixtures of
distributions satisfying Poincar\'e inequalities.
  2. Answering an open question posed by Blanca et al., we give efficient
identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions in the
coordinate-conditional sampling access model. We also give some simplifications
and improvements to the original algorithm of Blanca et al.

*Frank Cwitkowitz,Zhiyao Duan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores combining supervised and self-supervised learning for Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE), showing improved performance but uncovering a novel overfitting issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPE methods rely heavily on supervised learning, which faces challenges due to limited annotated data. Self-supervised techniques show promise but lag behind supervised methods.

Method: The authors extend supervised MPE by incorporating self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and pitch-equivariant properties, using joint training.

Result: Joint training improves performance under closed conditions, but reveals a phenomenon of overfitting to supervised data while degrading on self-supervised data.

Conclusion: The study highlights a trade-off in hybrid training approaches and provides insights into the underlying challenges.

Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many
applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music
transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised
learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for
the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties
of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and
polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised
methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by
incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and
pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial
improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that
applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further
improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model
simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used
for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our
insights on the underlying problem.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper addresses singularity detection in scientific computing using a self-supervised learning framework to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Singularities in functions hinder numerical methods, especially when their locations are unknown, necessitating efficient detection techniques.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework with filtering methods (k-nearest neighbors and kernel density estimation) to detect singularities from raw data.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in handling input perturbation, label corruption, and various singularity types.

Conclusion: The SSL-based approach enhances singularity detection, offering potential for adaptive numerical methods.

Abstract: The appearance of singularities in the function of interest constitutes a
fundamental challenge in scientific computing. It can significantly undermine
the effectiveness of numerical schemes for function approximation, numerical
integration, and the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), etc.
The problem becomes more sophisticated if the location of the singularity is
unknown, which is often encountered in solving PDEs. Detecting the singularity
is therefore critical for developing efficient adaptive methods to reduce
computational costs in various applications. In this paper, we consider
singularity detection in a purely data-driven setting. Namely, the input only
contains given data, such as the vertex set from a mesh. To overcome the
limitation of the raw unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised learning
(SSL) framework for estimating the location of the singularity. A key component
is a filtering procedure as the pretext task in SSL, where two filtering
methods are presented, based on $k$ nearest neighbors and kernel density
estimation, respectively. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the
potential pathological or inaccurate results due to the use of raw data without
filtering. Various experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the
proposed approach to deal with input perturbation, label corruption, and
different kinds of singularities such interior circle, boundary layer,
concentric semicircles, etc.

*Krisanu Sarkar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: HGM is a first-order optimization algorithm that adapts learning rates using directional consistency of updates, improving convergence and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adaptive methods like Adam or RMSprop ignore geometric cues (e.g., gradient alignment), which can lead to suboptimal performance. HGM addresses this by leveraging directional information.

Method: HGM uses a hindsight mechanism to evaluate cosine similarity between current gradients and accumulated momentum, adjusting learning rates based on alignment.

Result: HGM accelerates convergence in smooth regions and maintains stability in erratic areas, outperforming existing optimizers in non-convex settings like deep learning.

Conclusion: HGM offers a simple, efficient, and effective improvement over traditional adaptive methods by intelligently responding to optimization landscape structure.

Abstract: We introduce Hindsight-Guided Momentum (HGM), a first-order optimization
algorithm that adaptively scales learning rates based on the directional
consistency of recent updates. Traditional adaptive methods, such as Adam or
RMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often
overlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional
information, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates,
which reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path.
HGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the
cosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This
allows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions,
increasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of
oscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that
accelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining
stability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability,
the method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing
optimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the
optimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over
existing approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep
neural network training.

### [541] [Correlated Mutations for Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22526)
*Ofer M. Shir,Michael Emmerich*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs) for solving Integer Programming (IP) problems, focusing on discrete search using the ℓ₁-norm and exploring mutation distributions like Truncated Normal and Double Geometric. The Double Geometric distribution is found superior for unbounded integer search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite theoretical advancements in IP, heuristics remain dominant. The study aims to develop IESs tailored for discrete spaces, addressing limitations of current methods that rely on continuous operators and the ℓ₂-norm.

Method: The study adopts the ℓ₁-norm, evaluates step-size, and explores mutation distributions (Uniform, Binomial, Truncated Normal, Double Geometric). Theoretical properties and empirical simulations are analyzed.

Result: Numerical simulations show the Double Geometric distribution is better suited for unbounded integer search, outperforming other strategies in non-separable quadratic IP.

Conclusion: Replacing the Truncated Normal with the Double Geometric distribution is beneficial, but the key improvement lies in adopting the ℓ₁-norm over the ℓ₂-norm for discrete search.

Abstract: Even with the recent theoretical advancements that dramatically reduced the
complexity of Integer Programming (IP), heuristics remain the dominant
problem-solvers for this difficult category. This study seeks to establish the
groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized
search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel
in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by
applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while
persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay
foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for
the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify
correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for
unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate
discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which
we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down
to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We
explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose
a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our
investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which
consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for
unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical
evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other
strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the
replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified
and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the
$\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes DNN approximations for Q-functions in MDPs with infinite time horizon, showing polynomial growth in parameters for state dimension and error tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of approximating Q-functions in MDPs, leveraging DNNs for scalable solutions.

Method: Uses DNNs with leaky ReLU activation to approximate Q-functions, building on the MLFP scheme.

Result: Demonstrates that Q-functions can be approximated with DNNs, with polynomial parameter growth in state dimension and error tolerance.

Conclusion: DNNs with leaky ReLU activation are effective for approximating Q-functions in MDPs, offering scalable solutions.

Abstract: Discrete time stochastic optimal control problems and Markov decision
processes (MDPs) are fundamental models for sequential decision-making under
uncertainty and as such provide the mathematical framework underlying
reinforcement learning theory. A central tool for solving MDPs is the Bellman
equation and its solution, the so-called $Q$-function. In this article, we
construct deep neural network (DNN) approximations for $Q$-functions associated
to MDPs with infinite time horizon and finite control set $A$. More
specifically, we show that if the the payoff function and the random transition
dynamics of the MDP can be suitably approximated by DNNs with leaky rectified
linear unit (ReLU) activation, then the solutions $Q_d\colon \mathbb R^d\to
\mathbb R^{|A|}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the associated Bellman equations can
also be approximated in the $L^2$-sense by DNNs with leaky ReLU activation
whose numbers of parameters grow at most polynomially in both the dimension
$d\in \mathbb{N}$ of the state space and the reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the
prescribed error $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof relies on the recently
introduced full-history recursive multilevel fixed-point (MLFP) approximation
scheme.

*Alexander Tyurin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores limitations in scaling distributed optimization in federated learning, showing that unbiased sparsification compressors cannot improve runtime terms beyond poly-logarithmic scaling in the number of workers, even in homogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the scalability limits of distributed optimization, particularly in federated learning, where communication and computation times impact performance.

Method: The study constructs a worst-case function and develops a lower bound framework, analyzing the concentration of a random sum to prove limitations.

Result: It is infeasible to scale server-side communication and variance-dependent runtime terms better than poly-logarithmically in the number of workers, even in homogeneous cases.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fundamental constraints in scaling distributed optimization, emphasizing the challenges in improving performance with increasing workers.

Abstract: We consider centralized distributed optimization in the classical federated
learning setup, where $n$ workers jointly find an $\varepsilon$-stationary
point of an $L$-smooth, $d$-dimensional nonconvex function $f$, having access
only to unbiased stochastic gradients with variance $\sigma^2$. Each worker
requires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the
communication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the
server are $\tau_{s}$ and $\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One
of the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability
with respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed
version of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L
\Delta}{n \varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where
$\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,
using unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the
variance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term. However,
once we account for the communication from the server to the workers
$\tau_{s}$, we prove that it becomes infeasible to design a method using
unbiased random sparsification compressors that scales both the server-side
communication runtime term $\tau_{s} d \frac{L \Delta}{\varepsilon}$ and the
variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L \Delta}{\varepsilon^2},$
better than poly-logarithmically in $n$, even in the homogeneous (i.i.d.) case,
where all workers access the same distribution. To establish this result, we
construct a new "worst-case" function and develop a new lower bound framework
that reduces the analysis to the concentration of a random sum, for which we
prove a concentration bound. These results reveal fundamental limitations in
scaling distributed optimization, even under the homogeneous assumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between conflicting objectives in MOPs and avoiding bias from clustering solutions in specific regions.

Method: Defines a Region of Interest (ROI) based on decision maker preferences, optimizes dispersion in the decision space, and combines it with convergence in the objective space.

Result: Preliminary experiments show improved solution quality and diversity by balancing dispersion and concentration.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates bias and enhances multi-objective optimization by balancing dispersion and convergence.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off
between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the
objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP
solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the
convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a
Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's
preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions
in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution
concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space
intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution
diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of
solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific
region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method
enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively
balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision
space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore CBO's effectiveness in closed-box adversarial attacks, where gradient access is unavailable, and to connect it with NES and gradient-based methods.

Method: The study rigorously relates CBO to NES and gradient-based optimization, providing experimental comparisons.

Result: CBO outperforms NES and other evolutionary strategies in certain adversarial attack scenarios.

Conclusion: CBO is a viable and sometimes superior alternative to NES for gradient-free adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) has established itself as an efficient
gradient-free optimization scheme, with attractive mathematical properties,
such as mean-field convergence results for non-convex loss functions. In this
work, we study CBO in the context of closed-box adversarial attacks, which are
imperceptible input perturbations that aim to fool a classifier, without
accessing its gradient. Our contribution is to establish a connection between
the so-called consensus hopping as introduced by Riedl et al. and natural
evolution strategies (NES) commonly applied in the context of adversarial
attacks and to rigorously relate both methods to gradient-based optimization
schemes. Beyond that, we provide a comprehensive experimental study that shows
that despite the conceptual similarities, CBO can outperform NES and other
evolutionary strategies in certain scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper extends a convexification-based denoising approach to multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data, proposing TV- and Tikhonov-based models with efficient solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address denoising challenges for manifold-valued data, particularly multi-binary (e.g., multi-color QR codes) and Stiefel-valued data (e.g., image/video recognition).

Method: Embed data in Euclidean space, encode manifolds via fixed-rank matrices, relax rank constraints for convexification, and apply standard convex algorithms.

Result: Proposed models for multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data are evaluated on synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively extends denoising techniques to new data types, offering practical solutions for manifold-valued data processing.

Abstract: The handling of manifold-valued data, for instance, plays a central role in
color restoration tasks relying on circle- or sphere-valued color models, in
the study of rotational or directional information related to the special
orthogonal group, and in Gaussian image processing, where the pixel statistics
are interpreted as values on the hyperbolic sheet. Especially, to denoise these
kind of data, there have been proposed several generalizations of total
variation (TV) and Tikhonov-type denoising models incorporating the underlying
manifolds. Recently, a novel, numerically efficient denoising approach has been
introduced, where the data are embedded in an Euclidean ambient space, the
non-convex manifolds are encoded by a series of positive semi-definite,
fixed-rank matrices, and the rank constraint is relaxed to obtain a
convexification that can be solved using standard algorithms from convex
analysis. The aim of the present paper is to extent this approach to new kinds
of data like multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data. Multi-binary data can, for
instance, be used to model multi-color QR codes whereas Stiefel-valued data
occur in image and video-based recognition. For both new data types, we propose
TV- and Tikhonov-based denoising modelstogether with easy-to-solve
convexification. All derived methods are evaluated on proof-of-concept,
synthetic experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the emergence of foundation
models, are leading to new opportunities to develop technology-based solutions
to societal problems. However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's
complex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety
guarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of
AI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based
systems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and
trustworthy?
  The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous
systems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning
Enabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI
applications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving
treatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less
well-defined with context-dependent interpretations. This motivated the
organization of a day-long workshop, held at University of Pennsylvania on
February 26, 2025, to bring together investigators funded by the NSF SLES
program with a broader pool of researchers studying AI safety. This report is
the result of the discussions in the working groups that addressed different
aspects of safety at the workshop. The report articulates a new research agenda
focused on developing theory, methods, and tools that will provide the
foundations of the next generation of AI-enabled systems.

### [548] [Mitigating Gambling-Like Risk-Taking Behaviors in Large Language Models: A Behavioral Economics Approach to AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22496)
*Y. Du*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper identifies gambling-like behaviors in LLMs, proposes the RARG framework to mitigate them, and shows measurable improvements in reducing biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic risk-taking behaviors in LLMs, analogous to gambling psychology, which affect accuracy and decision-making.

Method: Introduces the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG) framework, incorporating risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware decision making.

Result: Demonstrates reductions in overconfidence bias (18.7%), loss-chasing tendencies (24.3%), and improved risk calibration.

Conclusion: Establishes a systematic framework for understanding and mitigating gambling-like behaviors in AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors
analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence
bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from
behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these
"gambling-like" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward
outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically
miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)
framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these
behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms,
and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation
paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI
adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.
Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like
behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in
loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse
scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for
understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transparent, identity-linked peer review system using blockchain and AI to improve scholarly evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional peer review suffers from anonymity, delays, and gatekeeping, hindering academic validation.

Method: The framework leverages blockchain for immutable audit trails and AI for iterative synthesis, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

Result: The system incentivizes intellectual contributions, tracks epistemic evolution, and enables traceable reputational dynamics.

*Pratheeksha Nair,Gabriel Lefebvre,Sophia Garrel,Maryam Molamohammadi,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper critiques techno-solutionism in AI for social good, proposing the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework to ethically assess AI projects, especially for marginalized groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of oversimplifying social problems like human trafficking (HT) through AI, and to prevent harm to vulnerable communities.

Method: Introduces the RQ framework, a five-step pre-project ethical assessment tool, and applies it to an AI for HT case study.

Result: RQ highlights overlooked sociocultural complexities and shifts focus from surveillance to survivor empowerment.

Conclusion: RQ offers a contextual, reflexive approach to AI ethics, challenging instrumentalist norms and prioritizing relational responsibility.

Abstract: AI for good initiatives often rely on the assumption that technical
interventions can resolve complex social problems. In the context of human
trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation,
reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims
to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework
as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate
whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized
populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles
based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to
confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case
study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural
complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward
survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five
step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions
must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics
philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational,
reflexive responsibility.

### [551] [Computational Analysis of Climate Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22449)
*Carolyn Hicks*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The thesis examines the Climate Emergency movement's impact on local government climate policy using GPT-4-based system PALLM, finding CED-adopting councils prioritize urgency and equity more.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of large language models like GPT-4 in answering complex policy questions and evaluating the impact of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs) on local climate policies.

Method: Built PALLM, a GPT-4-based system, to analyze climate policy documents. Validated with policymakers and conducted large-scale analysis of Victoria's local government policies, comparing CED and non-CED councils.

Result: GPT-4 can perform high-level policy analysis, though with attribution limitations. CED councils showed more recent, climate-specific policies with greater focus on urgency, prioritization, and equity.

Conclusion: Large language models like GPT-4 enable scalable policy analysis, offering new research opportunities, with CEDs driving more urgent and equitable climate policies.

Abstract: This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local
government climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency
movement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through
the mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series
of commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the
aim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer
complex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM
(Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4.
This system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency
response plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the
performance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by
generating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria
and assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses.
Having established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to
conduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local
governments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the
methodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils
which have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is
capable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of
reliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.
Its use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more
likely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to
urgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which
have not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale
opens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers.

### [552] [Theories of "Sexuality" in Natural Language Processing Bias Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22481)
*Jacob Hobbs*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines how NLP systems and research handle queer sexualities, revealing gaps in definitions and conflations of gender/sexual identities, and offers recommendations for better bias analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and misrepresented in NLP systems and research, highlighting biases and gaps.

Method: Survey and analysis of 55 articles quantifying sexuality-based NLP bias, focusing on definitions and operationalization of sexuality.

Result: Sexuality is often undefined in literature, relying on normative assumptions, and methods conflate gender/sexual identities, leading to flawed bias quantification.

Conclusion: Recommendations for improved sexuality-based NLP bias analyses include deeper engagement with queer communities and interdisciplinary literature.

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as
wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of
multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and
amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this
scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and
(mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work
in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and
operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify
sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a
majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or
normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we
find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often
conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of
queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving
sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that
encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and
interdisciplinary literature.

*Sadia Kamal,Lalu Prasad Yadav Prakash,S M Rafiuddin,Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi,Atriya Sen,Sagnik Ray Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study shows that standard generation parameters don't significantly affect LLM political scores (PCT), but prompt variations and fine-tuning do. Fine-tuning on politically rich datasets doesn't differentially impact scores, questioning PCT validity and how political leanings are encoded in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how external factors like prompts and fine-tuning influence LLM political scores (PCT) and assess PCT's validity.

Method: Analyzed the impact of generation parameters, prompt variations, and fine-tuning on PCT scores, including politically rich datasets.

Result: Standard parameters don't affect PCT scores, but prompts and fine-tuning do. Politically rich datasets don't differentially impact scores.

Conclusion: PCT validity and the encoding of political leanings in LLMs need further investigation.

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to
quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that
examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard
generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores.
However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning
individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that
when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than
others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a
thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as
the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

TL;DR: GPT4DFCI, an AI tool by Dana-Farber and Microsoft, was tested for reproducing copyrighted content. It occasionally reproduced book quotes but not news, scientific articles, or health records. Mitigations were added in v2.8.2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if GPT models in GPT4DFCI output copyrighted data, ensuring legal and ethical compliance.

Method: Red teaming event to test reproduction of content from books, news, scientific articles, and health records.

Result: Isolated cases of reproducing book quotes; no reproduction from news, science, or health records, but some fabrication.

Conclusion: Mitigations implemented in GPT4DFCI v2.8.2; encourages similar stress-testing for AI tools.

Abstract: Generative AI is present in multiple industries. Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, in partnership with Microsoft, has created an internal AI tool,
GPT4DFCI. Together we hosted a red teaming event to assess whether the
underlying GPT models that support the tool would output copyrighted data. Our
teams focused on reproducing content from books, news articles, scientific
articles, and electronic health records. We found isolated instances where
GPT4DFCI was able to identify copyrighted material and reproduce exact quotes
from famous books which indicates that copyrighted material was in the training
data. The model was not able to reproduce content from our target news article,
scientific article, or electronic health records. However, there were instances
of fabrication. As a result of this event, a mitigation strategy is in
production in GPT4DFCI v2.8.2, deployed on January 21, 2025. We hope this
report leads to similar events in which AI software tools are stress-tested to
assess the perimeter of their legal and ethical usage.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces the GAS framework to analyze LLMs' impact on organizations, highlighting trade-offs between generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and the redistribution of complexity from users to organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that AI merely reduces input costs and to explore how LLMs reshape competitive strategy by relocating complexity.

Method: Proposes the GAS framework to analyze trade-offs and complexity redistribution in LLM adoption.

Result: LLMs shift complexity to infrastructure and specialized roles, creating managerial challenges, especially in high-stakes accuracy.

Conclusion: Competitive advantage now depends on managing redistributed complexity through abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and expertise, redefining AI integration.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to
analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and
competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input
costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among
generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity
across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by
offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this
user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to
infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off,
therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the
organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy
in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer
stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity
through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary
expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition
relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration.

### [556] [FedCLAM: Client Adaptive Momentum with Foreground Intensity Matching for Federated Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22580)
*Vasilis Siomos,Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach,Giacomo Tarroni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FedCLAM improves federated learning for medical imaging by adapting to client-specific conditions and aligning image intensities, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging faces challenges like device and population diversity, reducing global model effectiveness in federated learning.

Method: FedCLAM uses client-adaptive momentum, personalized dampening, and intensity alignment loss to address heterogeneity.

Result: FedCLAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in medical segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: FedCLAM effectively handles medical imaging heterogeneity in federated learning, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A DL-based method transforms 2D real-time cine images into 3D cine datasets for pediatric and congenital heart disease, showing good agreement with conventional CMR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline CMR by combining 2D free-breathing real-time cines into a 3D cine dataset using DL, reducing acquisition and reconstruction times.

Method: Four DL models were trained for contrast correction, motion correction, super-resolution, and segmentation, validated on 10 patients.

Result: Successful 3D cine creation in <1 min, with good agreement in ventricular volumes and vessel diameters compared to conventional imaging.

Conclusion: The method shows potential to speed up CMR in clinical practice, offering fully segmented data within 2 minutes.

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

*Xinlei Yu,Chanmiao Wang,Hui Jin,Ahmed Elazab,Gangyong Jia,Xiang Wan,Changqing Zou,Ruiquan Ge*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CRISP-SAM2 is a novel model for multi-organ medical segmentation that improves accuracy by leveraging cross-modal interaction and semantic prompting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-organ segmentation models face issues like inaccurate details, reliance on geometric prompts, and loss of spatial information. CRISP-SAM2 aims to address these limitations.

Method: The model uses cross-modal contextualized semantics and semantic prompting, replacing geometric prompts. It includes a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy and mask-refining for better medical imaging adaptation.

Result: CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models on seven public datasets, demonstrating superior performance in addressing segmentation challenges.

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2 effectively enhances multi-organ segmentation by improving detail accuracy and eliminating reliance on geometric prompts, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CA-Diff integrates anatomical features into diffusion models for improved brain MRI segmentation, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle with complex brain structures, and current diffusion models neglect anatomical information.

Method: Proposes CA-Diff, incorporating distance fields for spatial context, a collaborative diffusion process, consistency loss, and a time-adapted channel attention module.

Result: CA-Diff achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: CA-Diff effectively leverages anatomical features for precise brain MRI segmentation, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Anran Liu,Xiaofei Wang,Jing Cai,Chao Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A mutual-information-guided diffusion model is proposed for virtual staining of H&E images to IHC, addressing challenges like style decomposition, controllable staining, and structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E staining lacks specificity for diagnostic markers, while IHC is limited by tissue and antibody constraints. Virtual staining offers a computational solution.

Method: The study introduces a mutual-information-guided score-based diffusion model, featuring global and local MI strategies for disentangling and ensuring structural consistency.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its biomedical potential.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key challenges in virtual staining, with plans to open-source the code.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks
specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and
antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the
H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is
promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still
face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue
structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

*Hongyi Pan,Ziliang Hong,Gorkem Durak,Ziyue Xu,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A generative AI-based data augmentation framework improves federated learning (FL) performance for breast cancer diagnosis using ultrasound images by integrating synthetic data, but excessive use degrades results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL's effectiveness is limited by data scarcity and non-IID data distribution, which degrade model performance and generalization in medical tasks like breast cancer diagnosis.

Method: The study trains class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for benign and malignant lesions, integrates synthetic images into FL, and tests using FedAvg and FedProx on three breast ultrasound datasets.

Result: Incorporating synthetic images improved AUC scores (FedAvg: 0.9206 to 0.9237; FedProx: 0.9429 to 0.9538), but excessive synthetic data reduced performance.

Conclusion: Generative AI-based data augmentation can enhance FL for breast ultrasound classification, but a balanced ratio of real and synthetic data is crucial.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated MRI by incorporating physics constraints and a denoising diffusion prior.

Method: Uses a proximal splitting formulation with a pretrained denoising diffusion model and enforces k-space consistency and Bloch response adherence.

Result: Outperforms deep learning and compressed sensing MRF baselines, yielding more accurate parameter maps with better fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach
for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state

method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a
pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize
the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously
enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and
(2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo
brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed
sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better
preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for
solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UltraTwin is a novel generative framework for creating cardiac anatomical twins from sparse 2D US images, addressing challenges like rare paired data and US noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D and 3D US methods lack accuracy and resolution for cardiac examination, necessitating a better solution for precise treatment planning.

Method: UltraTwin uses a coarse-to-fine scheme and an implicit autoencoder for hierarchical reconstruction and topology-aware constraints, leveraging a new dataset of paired 2D US and CT images.

Result: UltraTwin outperforms competitors in reconstructing high-quality cardiac anatomical twins.

Conclusion: UltraTwin advances anatomical twin modeling, offering potential for personalized cardiac care.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

### [564] [Artificial Intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) Scoring for Fast and Accurate Quantification in Ultra-short Echo-time MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23506)
*Bowen Xin,Rohan Hickey,Tamara Blake,Jin Jin,Claire E Wainwright,Thomas Benkert,Alto Stemmer,Peter Sly,David Coman,Jason Dowling*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces APL scoring, an AI-assisted method for quantifying lung damage in CF using UTE-MRI, showing faster and more accurate results than traditional grid-level scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative scoring systems for structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI) in diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), and to provide a faster, more accurate alternative to CT-based methods.

Method: APL scoring involves 5 stages: image loading, AI lung segmentation, lung-bounded slice sampling, pixel-level annotation, and quantification/reporting.

Result: APL scoring was twice as fast (8.2 minutes per subject) and statistically more accurate (p=0.021) than grid-level scoring, with strong correlation (R=0.973, p=5.85e-9).

Conclusion: APL scoring has potential to improve clinical workflows for UTE-MRI and can be adapted for other MRI sequences and lung diseases.

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

*Renjie Liang,Zhengkang Fan,Jinqian Pan,Chenkun Sun,Russell Terry,Jie Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for generating renal radiology reports from 2D CT scans, combining structured abnormality features with a vision-language model, outperforms baselines and shows promise for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of medical imaging and variability in clinical documentation make radiology report generation challenging.

Method: A multi-task learning model extracts structured abnormality features (e.g., lesion attributes), which are combined with CT images and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate reports.

Result: The model outperforms random baselines and generates reports with key clinical content and reasonable textual accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates feasibility for modular, feature-informed report generation in renal imaging, with future work targeting 3D CT volumes and improved clinical fidelity.

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

*Gijs Luijten,Roberto Maria Scardigno,Lisle Faray de Paiva,Peter Hoyer,Jens Kleesiek,Domenico Buongiorno,Vitoantonio Bevilacqua,Jan Egger*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating deep learning (DL) and augmented reality (AR) to automate kidney volumetric measurements in ultrasound (US), improving usability and reducing cognitive load for clinicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: US is widely used but challenging due to its dynamic nature and the need to shift focus between the screen and patient. Manual measurements are time-consuming and prone to fatigue.

Method: The authors integrate DL-based semantic segmentation for real-time automated kidney measurements and AR to project US displays into the clinician's view. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed, one wireless and one for broader device compatibility.

Result: The system is evaluated for real-time feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with MedSAM and LiteMedSAM).

Conclusion: The open-source pipeline enhances US training and diagnostics, particularly in point-of-care settings, by automating measurements and improving ergonomics.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

### [568] [Hierarchical Characterization of Brain Dynamics via State Space-based Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22952)
*Yanwu Yang,Thomas Wolfers*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HST, a hierarchical state space-based tokenization network, to quantify brain dynamics using fMRI data, improving representation and stability of brain states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding brain dynamics via fMRI is challenging, especially in capturing transitions between functional states. Metastability offers a way to discretize brain signals, but existing methods lack transition dependencies and stable embeddings.

Method: HST uses a refined clustered VQ-VAE with quantization error feedback and clustering to hierarchically quantize brain states and transitions.

Result: Validated on two fMRI datasets, HST effectively quantifies hierarchical brain dynamics and shows potential for disease diagnosis and reconstruction.

Conclusion: HST provides a promising framework for analyzing brain metastability and dynamics, with applications in neuroscience and diagnostics.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in
capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.
Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has
offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into
interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to
cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging
vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful
reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods
ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain
dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a
Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which
quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a
state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization
Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback
and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating
metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate
our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease
diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising
framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis
of metastability.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MedRegion-CT is a region-focused MLLM framework for CT report generation, improving on global-feature methods by capturing region-specific details with innovations like $R^2$ Token Pooling, pseudo-masks, and patient-specific attributions. It outperforms existing methods in quality and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CT report generation methods focus on global features, missing region-specific details and abnormalities. MedRegion-CT aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes MedRegion-CT with $R^2$ Token Pooling for 3D feature extraction, pseudo-masks for region focus, and patient-specific text prompts. Evaluated on RadGenome-Chest CT.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in report generation, excelling in natural language quality and clinical relevance.

Conclusion: MedRegion-CT effectively captures region-specific details, enhancing CT report generation with interpretability and superior performance.

Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based
report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global
features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may
cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose
MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)
framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region
Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained
vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates
global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens
highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive
information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates
pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract
region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant
regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation
results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,
diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the
MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous
evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the
RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and
clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our
framework is publicly available.

TL;DR: A method combining Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx) and Mixup data augmentation achieves strong cross-domain generalization for COVID-19 detection in chest CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address domain shift in multi-source COVID-19 detection due to variations in imaging protocols, scanners, and patient populations.

Method: Incorporate VREx to minimize variance of empirical risks across domains and apply Mixup for data augmentation.

Result: Achieves an average macro F1 score of 0.96 across four sources.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces overfitting and enhances domain-invariant learning.

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge,
which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories
across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major
challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging
protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance
the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk
Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to
maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly
minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This
regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and
promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup
data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates
both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples,
encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its
resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1
score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating
strong generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate early diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) from ECGs is critical, but deep learning models require large labeled datasets, which are often scarce.

Method: Proposes a pipeline to synthesize tunable MI ECGs with realistic noise and pre-trains classifiers using self-supervised masked-autoencoding and a joint reconstruction-classification objective.

Result: Synthetic ECGs preserve key morphological features, and pretraining on them improves classification performance, with AUC gains up to 4 percentage points in low-data settings.

Conclusion: Controlled synthetic ECGs can enhance MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early
diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep
learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but
require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We
propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with
tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and
transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint
reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic
ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological
features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved
classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains
of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs
can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a non-invasive, radiation-free alternative to X-ray for diagnosing BPD in preterm neonates using MRI.

Method: High-resolution 3D MRI (StarVIBE series) paired with semantic segmentation algorithms and clinical data.

Result: A validated dataset and baseline models for lung and trachea segmentation to aid BPD diagnosis.

Conclusion: The dataset supports advanced research in neonatal lung imaging, offering a safer and more detailed diagnostic tool.

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm
neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic
modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation
and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms
of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and
semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in
identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired
with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40
neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist
of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as
the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and
baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to
support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D surgical scene comprehension with text-promptable capabilities is critical for surgical planning and intra-operative guidance, but existing methods lack real-time 3D query support.

Method: SurgTPGS integrates the Segment Anything model and vision-language models for 3D semantics feature learning, semantic-aware deformation tracking, and semantic region-aware optimization.

Result: Experiments on surgical datasets show SurgTPGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing reconstruction quality and semantic understanding.

Conclusion: SurgTPGS advances surgical precision and safety, paving the way for next-generation intelligent surgical systems.

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: FD-DiT, a frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer, improves LDCT reconstruction by focusing on noise in high-frequency domains and using a hybrid denoising network for better detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT reduces radiation but suffers from noise and artifacts, impacting diagnostic accuracy. Existing methods lack fine-grained detail preservation.

Method: Proposes FD-DiT with a diffusion strategy aligning noise distribution to LDCT data, frequency decoupling, hybrid denoising, sparse local attention, and dynamic fusion.

Result: FD-DiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in noise and artifact suppression at identical dose levels.

Conclusion: FD-DiT effectively enhances LDCT image quality by preserving fine details and suppressing noise.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers
from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise,
potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion
models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless,
existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details.
To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT)
is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy
that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns
with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we
employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in
high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential
anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then
utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the
capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse
local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer
information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature
representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for
optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at
identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior
noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AFUNet decouples HDR reconstruction into alignment and fusion tasks, optimizing them alternately for superior performance, backed by MAP estimation and deep unfolding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HDR reconstruction methods lack theoretical foundations, relying on empirical designs, which affects reliability.

Method: AFUNet uses a deep unfolding approach with Alignment-Fusion Modules (AFM), alternating between Spatial Alignment (SAM) and Channel Fusion (CFM) for iterative refinement.

Result: AFUNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: AFUNet provides a theoretically grounded, end-to-end trainable solution for HDR reconstruction, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from
multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but
they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which
can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the
cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR
reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --
alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving
synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method
formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors
across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems
through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we
reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming
the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with
carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each
iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that
alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel
Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging
misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance,
consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image data is hard to access due to privacy and labeling constraints, making synthetic data generation a viable solution.

Method: The study uses generative AI (GenAI) with diffusion models to create synthetic fetal head ultrasound images paired with masks, augmenting real datasets for fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Result: The synthetic data effectively captures real features, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation with Dice Scores of 94.66% (Spanish cohort) and 94.38% (African cohort) using limited real images.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the potential of synthetic data to improve medical image segmentation, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy
and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly,
time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these
challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution.
Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven
effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel
mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal
head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs
augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features
effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head
segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask
pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and
94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African
cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: MedSAM-CA is a fine-tuning approach for medical image segmentation, reducing reliance on large annotated datasets and improving boundary delineation with CBR-Net and Atte-FFB components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of limited annotated data and poor boundary delineation in medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes MedSAM-CA with CBR-Net for boundary refinement and Atte-FFB for feature fusion, adapting the pretrained MedSAM model.

Result: Achieves 94.43% Dice with only 2% training data on dermoscopy, nearing full-data performance (97.25%).

Conclusion: MedSAM-CA effectively enhances segmentation accuracy in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections
in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance
boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets
covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness
of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only
2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,
demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.

### [578] [MDPG: Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23701)
*Lingtong Zhang,Mengdie Song,Xiaohan Hao,Huayu Mai,Bensheng Qiu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) using latent diffusion models (LDMs) to improve MRI reconstruction by leveraging multi-domain priors and a novel fusion approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI reconstruction is critical for diagnostics, but diffusion models struggle with high-fidelity images due to stochasticity. LDMs offer compact prior knowledge, motivating their use for better reconstruction.

Method: The method includes a Visual-Mamba-based backbone for encoding, pre-trained LDMs for multi-domain priors, Latent Guided Attention (LGA) for fusion, and a Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for k-space and image domain fusion. A k-space regularization strategy is also introduced.

Result: Experiments on two MRI datasets validate the effectiveness of MDPG in enhancing reconstruction fidelity and data consistency.

Conclusion: MDPG successfully integrates LDMs and novel fusion techniques to improve MRI reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance in experiments.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical
diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have
struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in
image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed
prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model
towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by
this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by
pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.
Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables
efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained
LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image
domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion
in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior
in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with
generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for
self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we
propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration
signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is
available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.

*Zheng Fang,Xiaoming Qi,Chun-Mei Feng,Jialun Pei,Weixin Si,Yueming Jin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel Personalized Federated Learning (FL) scheme, FedST, is proposed for surgical instrument segmentation, leveraging domain-specific knowledge to address diverse anatomical backgrounds and similar instrument representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited FL works exist in surgical data science, and existing FL methods ignore surgical domain characteristics like diverse backgrounds and synthetic data potential.

Method: FedST uses Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) for local training and Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ) for global training.

Result: The method enhances segmentation by decoupling private embeddings for backgrounds and globally optimizing instrument representations, including temporal motion patterns.

Conclusion: FedST effectively leverages surgical domain knowledge to improve segmentation performance in FL settings.

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising
direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the
model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works
in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider
inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show
diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;
ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data
generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized
FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),
which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and
global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a
Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site
training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to
encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized
globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including
the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel
selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating
model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose
Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an
explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model
convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance segmentation accuracy by focusing on anatomical shapes, noting that model modifications yield minimal gains.

Method: Introduces ShapeKit, a shape-focused toolkit for refining anatomical shapes without re-training models.

Result: ShapeKit boosts segmentation performance by over 8%, surpassing the marginal gains from architectural changes.

Conclusion: The work underscores the importance of shape-based tools in medical segmentation, advocating for their broader adoption.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical approach to improve anatomical shape
accuracy in whole-body medical segmentation. Our analysis shows that a
shape-focused toolkit can enhance segmentation performance by over 8%, without
the need for model re-training or fine-tuning. In comparison, modifications to
model architecture typically lead to marginal gains of less than 3%. Motivated
by this observation, we introduce ShapeKit, a flexible and easy-to-integrate
toolkit designed to refine anatomical shapes. This work highlights the
underappreciated value of shape-based tools and calls attention to their
potential impact within the medical segmentation community.

Result: C3VDv2 offers diverse challenges (e.g., fecal debris, fast camera motion) for robust algorithm testing.

Conclusion: The dataset's enhanced realism supports more accurate and representative development of 3D reconstruction algorithms.

Abstract: Computer vision techniques have the potential to improve the diagnostic
performance of colonoscopy, but the lack of 3D colonoscopy datasets for
training and validation hinders their development. This paper introduces
C3VDv2, the second version (v2) of the high-definition Colonoscopy 3D Video
Dataset, featuring enhanced realism designed to facilitate the quantitative
evaluation of 3D colon reconstruction algorithms. 192 video sequences were
captured by imaging 60 unique, high-fidelity silicone colon phantom segments.
Ground truth depth, surface normals, optical flow, occlusion,
six-degree-of-freedom pose, coverage maps, and 3D models are provided for 169
colonoscopy videos. Eight simulated screening colonoscopy videos acquired by a
gastroenterologist are provided with ground truth poses. The dataset includes
15 videos featuring colon deformations for qualitative assessment. C3VDv2
emulates diverse and challenging scenarios for 3D reconstruction algorithms,
including fecal debris, mucous pools, blood, debris obscuring the colonoscope
lens, en-face views, and fast camera motion. The enhanced realism of C3VDv2
will allow for more robust and representative development and evaluation of 3D

*Yu Zhang,Shanshan Zhao,Bokui Wan,Jinjuan Wang,Xiaodong Yan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for detecting minor average treatment effects in large-scale applications using a counterfactual outcome framework and a two-armed bandit process, improving statistical power and reducing experimental costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting minor treatment effects is challenging but economically impactful. Traditional methods lack sensitivity for small discrepancies.

Method: Leverages a counterfactual outcome framework and a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process, weighted by mean volatility statistic, with permutation methods for robustness.

Result: The approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null hypothesis and less concentrated under the alternative, improving statistical power. Experimental results show significant A/B testing improvements.

Conclusion: The method enhances detection of minor effects, reduces costs, and maintains high statistical power, making it valuable for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Detecting a minor average treatment effect is a major challenge in
large-scale applications, where even minimal improvements can have a
significant economic impact. Traditional methods, reliant on normal
distribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor
effects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with
sufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework
and proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by
weighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The
implementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and
efficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates
that our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null
hypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis,
greatly improving statistical power. The experimental results indicate a
significant improvement in the A/B testing, highlighting the potential to
reduce experimental costs while maintaining high statistical power.

*Guan-Horng Liu,Jaemoo Choi,Yongxin Chen,Benjamin Kurt Miller,Ricky T. Q. Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ASBS is a new diffusion sampler using Schrödinger Bridge for efficient sampling without needing target samples during training. It scales well and outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior diffusion samplers require complex processes or importance-weighted estimation, limiting scalability and practicality.

Method: ASBS uses Schrödinger Bridge and stochastic optimal control theory for scalable learning via Adjoint Matching, relaxing restrictive conditions.

Result: ASBS effectively samples from energy functions, conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

Conclusion: ASBS offers a scalable, efficient alternative to prior diffusion samplers, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution
-- where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy
function -- have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit
target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion
samplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning
processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy
and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose
Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that
employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to
estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical
model -- the Schr\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via
kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal
control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned
at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution.
Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to
arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition
that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy
functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann
distributions.

*Luhuan Wu,Mingzhang Yin,Yixin Wang,John P. Cunningham,David M. Blei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP) is introduced as a probabilistic model for identifying invariant features across environments, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize predictions to new environments and reveal causal mechanisms by identifying invariant features with stable predictive relationships.

Method: BIP encodes invariant feature indices as latent variables and recovers them via posterior inference, with an efficient variational approximation (VI-BIP) for scalability.

Result: BIP and VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods, with proven posterior consistency and faster contraction in heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: BIP provides a robust and scalable solution for invariant prediction, enhancing generalization and causal insight.

Abstract: Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from
multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable
predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to
new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have
primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized
optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a
probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of
invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior
inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior
targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent
and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior
contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational
approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and
VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant
prediction.

TL;DR: CN-SBM is a probabilistic model for clustering cancer samples and genomic regions using discrete copy number states, outperforming existing methods and revealing clinically relevant subtypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Gaussian or Poisson-based models in capturing discrete CNV data and subpopulation-specific patterns in cancer evolution.

Method: Uses a bipartite categorical block model (CN-SBM) with a two-stage approach to decompose CNV data into primary and residual components, employing scalable variational inference.

Result: Improved model fit over existing methods, identification of clinically relevant subtypes in TCGA low-grade glioma data, and enhanced patient stratification.

Conclusion: CN-SBM is an interpretable, scalable framework for CNV analysis, useful for understanding tumor heterogeneity and prognosis.

Abstract: Cancer is a genetic disorder whose clonal evolution can be monitored by
tracking noisy genome-wide copy number variants. We introduce the Copy Number
Stochastic Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly
clusters samples and genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using
a bipartite categorical block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or
Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects the discrete nature of CNV calls and
captures subpopulation-specific patterns through block-wise structure. Using a
two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual
components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and
finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for
application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated
and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to
TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and
structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival
analysis. These results establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable
framework for CNV analysis with direct relevance for tumor heterogeneity and
prognosis.

Motivation: Addressing the opacity of supervised learning algorithms to enhance interpretability and deployment, especially in high-stakes domains.

Method: Develops a significance test by masking feature values and evaluating performance differences, using a randomized sign test for exact p-values.

Result: Validated on synthetic tasks, showing statistical and computational advantages, and demonstrated practical utility on real-world data.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust, efficient way to assess feature significance without retraining or auxiliary models.

Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge,
hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly
in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic
significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression
or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental
contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under
the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test
set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful,
randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing
feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for
estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal
assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains
computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings.
Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational
advantages, and applications to real-world data illustrate its practical
utility.

Motivation: To address the challenge of computing optimal transport maps between unpaired samples of continuous distributions efficiently and accurately.

Conclusion: The method is theoretically sound and practically effective for optimal transport tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel machine learning approach to compute the

samples, based on the DeepParticle methods. The proposed method leads to a
min-min optimization during training and does not impose any restriction on the

a quantitative error bound between the learned map and the optimal transport
map. Our numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and the

TL;DR: The paper addresses covariate shift in function moment estimation, proposing a two-stage algorithm with likelihood ratio reweighting and a truncated estimator for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariate shift is common but underexplored in function moment estimation, especially when source and target distributions differ.

Method: A two-stage algorithm: optimal function estimation under the source distribution, followed by likelihood ratio reweighting. A truncated estimator is introduced for unknown distributions.

Result: The method achieves minimax optimal bounds (up to a logarithmic factor) and demonstrates effectiveness in synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust solution for covariate shift in moment estimation, supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of input features differs
between the training and testing phases. In covariate shift, estimating an
unknown function's moment is a classical problem that remains under-explored,
despite its common occurrence in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
investigate the minimax lower bound of the problem when the source and target
distributions are known. To achieve the minimax optimal bound (up to a
logarithmic factor), we propose a two-stage algorithm. Specifically, it first
trains an optimal estimator for the function under the source distribution, and
then uses a likelihood ratio reweighting procedure to calibrate the moment
estimator. In practice, the source and target distributions are typically
unknown, and estimating the likelihood ratio may be unstable. To solve this
problem, we propose a truncated version of the estimator that ensures double
robustness and provide the corresponding upper bound. Extensive numerical
studies on synthetic examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess partial effects in Frechet regression on Bures-Wasserstein manifolds, a task lacking robust statistical tools.

Method: Sample splitting: first subsample fits the model, second constructs the test statistic, which converges to a weighted chi-squared mixture.

Result: The test achieves nominal asymptotic size and uniform power convergence to one. Simulations confirm accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed test is effective for finite-sample and practical applications in Frechet regression.

Abstract: We propose a novel test for assessing partial effects in Frechet regression
on Bures Wasserstein manifolds. Our approach employs a sample splitting
strategy: the first subsample is used to fit the Frechet regression model,
yielding estimates of the covariance matrices and their associated optimal
transport maps, while the second subsample is used to construct the test
statistic. We prove that this statistic converges in distribution to a weighted
mixture of chi squared components, where the weights correspond to the
eigenvalues of an integral operator defined by an appropriate RKHS kernel. We
establish that our procedure achieves the nominal asymptotic size and
demonstrate that its worst-case power converges uniformly to one. Through
extensive simulations and a real data application, we illustrate the test's
finite-sample accuracy and practical utility.

Result: Demonstrated efficiency with the transverse-field Ising model; potential for broader quantum systems with complex nodal structures.

Conclusion: The method provides a systematic, polynomial-time approach to initializing neural network quantum states, shortening the distance to ground states.

Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states

multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the
MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network
quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial
time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the
distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the
rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by
taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible
applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which
the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A TTS system for L2 speakers uses vowel duration differences to improve clarity, reducing transcription errors by 9.15% without listeners noticing. Whisper-ASR fails to assess intelligibility for L2 speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of TTS systems designed for L2 speakers by improving intelligibility through vowel duration adjustments.

Method: Developed a 'clarity mode' in Matcha-TTS using American English tense/lax vowel duration differences and tested it with French-L1, English-L2 listeners.

Result: Clarity mode reduced transcription errors by 9.15% and was perceived as more encouraging, though listeners mistakenly believed slowed speech was more intelligible. Whisper-ASR was ineffective for assessing L2 intelligibility.

Conclusion: Vowel duration adjustments improve L2 intelligibility, but listener perception and ASR tools may not align with actual improvements.

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language
(L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense
(longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS.
Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer
(at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it
more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably,
listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error
rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words
was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not
correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that
Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult
vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for
these individuals.

Conclusion: TinyWave enables efficient speech generation for real-time applications and low-resource environments, with released models and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WavShape is a framework for learning fair and private speech embeddings by filtering sensitive attributes while preserving task-relevant information, achieving significant reduction in mutual information for sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes, risking bias and privacy leaks, necessitating a solution to balance fairness, privacy, and utility.

Method: Uses mutual information estimation (Donsker-Varadhan formulation) to guide an encoder that filters sensitive attributes while retaining essential speech content.

Result: Reduces mutual information for sensitive attributes by up to 81% while preserving 97% of task-relevant information.

Conclusion: WavShape advances fair, privacy-aware speech systems by integrating information theory with self-supervised models.

Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity,
accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and
privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech
representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and
privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual
information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an
MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while
maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results
on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and
sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant
information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech
models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and
resource-efficient speech systems.

*Qi He,Gus Xia,Ziyu Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) is a novel approach for hierarchical music generation using an instruction-tuned LLM, enabling multi-track electronic music with full-song structure and interactive co-creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore concept hierarchy in music generation, moving beyond temporal hierarchies to include idea generation, transformation, and organization into complete compositions.

Method: Introduces TOMI, representing compositions in a 4D space (clips, sections, tracks, transformations) and integrates it with REAPER for human-AI co-creation.

Result: Generates higher-quality electronic music with stronger structural coherence than baselines.

Conclusion: TOMI effectively bridges hierarchical planning and interactive music generation, enhancing both quality and coherence.

Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences
structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of
music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy,
which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately
organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To
this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a
novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via
instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track
composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips
(short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks
(instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is
capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure,
and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio
workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with
stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: XY-Tokenizer is a novel speech codec balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity, outperforming existing codecs in both aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with semantic richness for language models.

Method: Proposes XY-Tokenizer, a multi-stage, multi-task learning approach to mitigate the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities.

Result: Achieves strong text alignment (surpassing SpeechTokenizer and Mimi) and speaker similarity score of 0.83, comparable to BigCodec (0.84).

Conclusion: XY-Tokenizer effectively balances semantic and acoustic performance, offering a robust solution for speech language models.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language
models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve
acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However,
existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction
with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the
limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic
fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict
between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task
learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves
performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of
state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those
existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer
achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling
methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker
similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The
reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec,
the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a
speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are

TL;DR: E2PANNs, a lightweight CNN, is introduced for efficient EV siren detection, achieving state-of-the-art results with high computational efficiency and edge-device suitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate EV siren recognition is vital for smart transportation and autonomous driving, but current solutions lack large datasets and are computationally demanding.

Method: E2PANNs, derived from PANNs, is fine-tuned using AudioSet EV and evaluated through ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and real-time edge deployment.

Result: E2PANNs outperform existing methods, capturing distinct siren patterns efficiently and performing well in real-time edge applications.

Conclusion: E2PANNs set a new benchmark for EV siren detection, offering high efficiency and practicality for safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the
integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring
systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are
limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational
demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces
E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework,
specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated
subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across
multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The
experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and
real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses
exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into
the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct
spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real
time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection
metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results
demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research
domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based
audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

*Louis Bradshaw,Honglu Fan,Alexander Spangher,Stella Biderman,Simon Colton*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Generative autoregressive transformer models trained on symbolic piano music outperform symbolic generation techniques and compete with audio models, while contrastive MIDI embeddings achieve state-of-the-art classification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capabilities of transformer models in symbolic music generation and representation learning, leveraging large-scale pretraining and finetuning for high-quality outputs.

Method: Pretrained on 60,000 hours of music, finetuned on a high-quality subset for continuations, classification, and contrastive MIDI embeddings using SimCLR adaptation.

Result: Generative model excels in piano continuation coherence; contrastive model achieves top classification results with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: Pretrained transformers are highly effective for symbolic music tasks, offering strong performance and generalizability with limited labeled data.

Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models
trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first
pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively
smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical
continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce
general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to
symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative
model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains
competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification
benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve
state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning
demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often
requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream
tasks.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) is inadequate for local music information retrieval (MIR) tasks, showing its effectiveness when paired with a transformer (ViT-1D).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of contrastive SSL for local MIR tasks, contrary to the common belief that it is only suitable for global tasks.

Method: Uses a lightweight vision transformer (ViT-1D) with one-dimensional patches and trains it with contrastive SSL via NT-Xent loss. Analyzes sequence tokens and attention maps.

Result: Sequence tokens perform well on local tasks, and high-level musical features emerge in attention maps. Contrastive SSL with transformers proves effective for sequence modeling in MIR.

Conclusion: Contrastive SSL paired with transformers has overlooked abilities for local MIR tasks and provides interpretable musical insights.

Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning
for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as
automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is
widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised
models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,
masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the
potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We
consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the
time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL
through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although
NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks
to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence
tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens
offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful
properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform
unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,
high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention
maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different
musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but
advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some
overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence
modeling in MIR.

### [600] [Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717)
*Xingting Yao,Qinghao Hu,Fei Zhou,Tielong Liu,Gang Li,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive bit allocation strategy for multi-bit SNNs to optimize memory and computation resources, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-bit SNNs face disproportionate performance improvements due to escalating memory and computation demands. The paper addresses this by leveraging layer-wise importance and avoiding wasted bits.

Method: The method involves parametrizing temporal lengths and bit widths of weights and spikes, making them learnable via gradients. A refined spiking neuron is proposed to handle variable bit widths and temporal lengths, along with a step-size renewal mechanism to mitigate quantization errors.

Result: Experiments on static and dynamic datasets show reduced memory and computation costs with higher accuracy. For example, SEWResNet-34 achieved a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16× lower bit budgets on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The adaptive bit allocation strategy effectively enhances SNN efficiency and accuracy, with promising results across diverse datasets. The work will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated
research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with
more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to
the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on
the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra
bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit
allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise
allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and
accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and
the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable
through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths
and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle
different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal
lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically
formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may
incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size
renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,
including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and
DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and
computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our
SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit
budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully
open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCEAs face instability due to complex dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: MGM employs a 'marker gene' as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: MGM stabilizes games like Rock-Paper-Scissors, improves C-RMOEA/D on ZDT benchmarks, and handles the Shapley Biased Game with a Memory Pool extension.

Conclusion: MGM is a theoretically and empirically validated framework that enhances CCEA stability and robustness in competitive environments.

Abstract: Competitive Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) are often hampered by complex
dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, leading to unstable
convergence. To counter these challenges, this paper introduces the Marker Gene
Method (MGM), a framework that establishes stability by using a 'marker gene'
as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance
exploration and exploitation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs
demonstrating that MGM creates strong attractors near Nash Equilibria within
the Strictly Competitive Game framework. Empirically, MGM demonstrates its
efficacy across a spectrum of challenges: it stabilizes the canonical
Rock-Paper-Scissors game, significantly improves the performance of C-RMOEA/D
on ZDT benchmarks, and, when augmented with a Memory Pool (MP) extension, it
successfully tames the notoriously pathological Shapley Biased Game. This work
presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated framework that
substantially enhances the stability and robustness of CCEAs in complex
competitive environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a two-layer spiking neural network for real-time, low-power spike sorting in brain-machine interfaces, outperforming existing methods with improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of achieving real-time, low-power spike sorting in brain-machine interfaces while maintaining high neural decoding performance drives this research.

Method: NSS uses the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding and a custom neuron model for multi-bit spike coding on neuromorphic platforms like Intel's Loihi 2.

Result: NSS achieved a 77% F1-score (+10% improvement) with 2-bit graded spikes, consuming 8.6mW and processing in 0.25ms per inference.

Conclusion: NSS demonstrates superior performance and efficiency for spike sorting, making it a promising solution for real-time BMIs.

Abstract: Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural
signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity. A key
challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power
spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This
study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer
spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the
Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant
features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to
sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely
unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic
platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling
flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths.
Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift
showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans.
With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with
leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10%
improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting
recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per

TL;DR: TEDI is a discretization-free algorithm for learning truthful and utility-maximizing mechanisms, using pricing rules and a novel menu mechanism. It employs Partial GroupMax Network and innovative training techniques, ensuring truthfulness, expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based mechanisms rely on discretization, causing inefficiency with larger problem sizes. TEDI aims to overcome this by eliminating discretization while ensuring truthfulness.

Method: TEDI formalizes pricing rules and introduces a menu mechanism. It uses Partial GroupMax Network for parameterization and novel training techniques like covariance trick and continuous sampling for unbiased gradient estimation.

Result: TEDI guarantees truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experiments show it performs competitively or better than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TEDI is the first approach to learn truthful mechanisms without discretization, improving efficiency. Its concepts and techniques offer new insights for automated mechanism design and differentiable economics.

Abstract: This paper introduces TEDI (Truthful, Expressive, and Dimension-Insensitive
approach), a discretization-free algorithm to learn truthful and
utility-maximizing mechanisms. Existing learning-based approaches often rely on
discretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to
inefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we
formalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes
to prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can
be equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The
core idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial
GroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally
approximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we
develop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous
sampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order
optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees
truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental
evaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves
strong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.
  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without
outcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency. The proposed
concepts, network architecture, and learning techniques might offer potential

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: TAG-WM is a tamper-aware generative watermarking method addressing copyright and authenticity risks in AI-generated content. It embeds dual watermarks for copyright and localization, detects tampered areas, and maintains generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated content faces copyright and authenticity risks, and current watermarking methods lack robustness and proactive tampering localization.

Method: TAG-WM uses dual-mark joint sampling, watermark latent reconstruction, dense variation region detection, and tamper-aware decoding.

Result: TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art tampering robustness and localization with minimal distortion and high capacity.

Conclusion: TAG-WM effectively addresses copyright and tampering risks in AI-generated content while preserving visual quality.

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises
copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity
verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a
potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable
of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.
However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing
applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new
demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks
remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,
necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid
iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making
proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.
To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative
image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key
modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright
and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative
quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a
dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion
sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and
the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The
experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness
and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining
lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heavy workload of DBAs and the limitations of existing autonomous database platforms in addressing comprehensive database maintenance drive the need for an advanced solution like GaussMaster.

Method: GaussMaster employs a Tree-of-thought approach to analyze metrics and logs, identify root causes, and invoke tools for automatic issue resolution.

Result: Implemented in real-world scenarios like banking, GaussMaster achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance tasks.

Conclusion: GaussMaster demonstrates significant improvements in automating database maintenance, offering a scalable solution for the financial industry.

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs
shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment,
diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and
customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an
effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous
database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing
single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual
intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance.
GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based
database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to
assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide
comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit
abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire
maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of
metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,
and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully
implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,
where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance
scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of symmetry groups on the complexity of reachability in VASS, especially for applications like data VASS.

Method: Analyzes reachability in VASS under various permutation groups (trivial, symmetric, alternating, cyclic) and combinations thereof.

Result: Reachability is PSPACE-complete for symmetric groups, contrasting with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS.

Conclusion: Symmetry groups significantly simplify reachability problems, with potential implications for data VASS.

Abstract: We investigate the reachability problem in symmetric vector addition systems
with states (VASS), where transitions are invariant under a group of
permutations of coordinates. One extremal case, the trivial groups, yields
general VASS. In another extremal case, the symmetric groups, we show that the
reachability problem can be solved in PSPACE, regardless of the dimension of
input VASS (to be contrasted with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS). We
also consider other groups, in particular alternating and cyclic ones.
Furthermore, motivated by the open status of the reachability problem in data
VASS, we estimate the gain in complexity when the group arises as a combination
of the trivial and symmetric groups.

TL;DR: P4OMP is a retrieval-augmented framework using LLMs to transform serial C/C++ code into OpenMP-annotated parallel code, improving correctness and reliability without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of LLM-generated OpenMP code by leveraging retrieval-based prompting and structured knowledge, avoiding common errors in baseline methods.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to ground code generation, improving syntactic correctness.

Result: Achieves 100% compilation success on parallelizable cases, outperforming GPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, which fails in 20/108 cases. Demonstrates strong runtime scaling.

Conclusion: P4OMP provides a robust, modular pipeline for reliable LLM-generated OpenMP code, addressing common errors and improving applicability.

Abstract: We present P4OMP, a retrieval-augmented framework for transforming serial
C/C++ code into OpenMP-annotated parallel code using large language models
(LLMs). To our knowledge, this is the first system to apply retrieval-based
prompting for OpenMP pragma correctness without model fine-tuning or compiler
instrumentation. P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the
reliability of prompt-driven code generation. By grounding generation in the
retrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline
prompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,
GPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world
C++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.
P4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the
baseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on
non-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to
fundamental OpenMP limitations. A detailed analysis demonstrates how P4OMP
consistently avoids scoping errors, syntactic misuse, and invalid directive
combinations that commonly affect baseline-generated code. We further
demonstrate strong runtime scaling across seven compute-intensive benchmarks on
an HPC cluster. P4OMP offers a robust, modular pipeline that significantly
improves the reliability and applicability of LLM-generated OpenMP code.

TL;DR: RAILS enhances LLM-assisted software development by retrieving context from Java resources and refining suggestions via compiler feedback, improving accuracy over baseline prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo often produce incomplete or incorrect code due to lack of project-specific context, necessitating a solution like RAILS.

Method: RAILS uses FAISS and OpenAI embeddings to retrieve relevant Java context, augmented by an iterative validation loop with compiler feedback.

Result: RAILS outperformed baseline prompting on 78 Java import error cases, preserving intent and avoiding hallucinations.

Conclusion: RAILS effectively improves LLM-generated code accuracy; future work includes symbolic filtering and broader language/IDE support.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo are increasingly used to
assist software development, yet they often produce incomplete code or
incorrect imports, especially when lacking access to external or
project-specific documentation. We introduce RAILS (Retrieval-Augmented
Intelligence for Learning Software Development), a framework that augments LLM
prompts with semantically retrieved context from curated Java resources using
FAISS and OpenAI embeddings. RAILS incorporates an iterative validation loop
guided by compiler feedback to refine suggestions. We evaluated RAILS on 78
real-world Java import error cases spanning standard libraries, GUI APIs,
external tools, and custom utilities. Despite using the same LLM, RAILS
outperforms baseline prompting by preserving intent, avoiding hallucinations,
and surfacing correct imports even when libraries are unavailable locally.
Future work will integrate symbolic filtering via PostgreSQL and extend support
to other languages and IDEs.

*Sen Fang,Weiyuan Ding,Antonio Mastropaolo,Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Quantization improves LLM robustness in code generation, outperforming full-precision models in adversarial and noise tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unexplored impact of quantization on LLM robustness in code generation tasks.

Method: Systematic experiments on four LLM families (350M to 33B parameters) evaluating robustness via adversarial attacks and noise perturbations.

Result: Quantized LLMs show superior robustness (51.59% vs. 42.86% in adversarial tests) and better noise resilience.

Conclusion: Quantization enhances LLM reliability in code generation, offering insights for robust and efficient deployment.

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large
Language Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference
without architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses
on evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original
counterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this
paper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization
affects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive
experiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and
StarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate
robustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and
noise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional
wisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness
compared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our
adversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,
our noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation
generally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest
that quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually
enhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights
for developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach using CoT, ICL, and LLMs to extract privacy behaviors from software documents and generate privacy requirements as user stories, achieving high accuracy with models like GPT-4o and Llama 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy is often treated as an afterthought in software development, leading to non-compliance. Current methods focus on legal requirements, but this paper aims to proactively address privacy during development.

Method: Uses chain-of-thought prompting, in-context-learning, and LLMs to extract privacy behaviors and generate privacy user stories from software documents.

Result: LLMs like GPT-4o and Llama 3 achieved F1 scores over 0.8, with performance improvable via parameter-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages LLMs for privacy requirement generation, offering insights for optimizing their use in software development.

Abstract: Research shows that analysts and developers consider privacy as a security
concept or as an afterthought, which may lead to non-compliance and violation
of users' privacy. Most current approaches, however, focus on extracting legal
requirements from the regulations and evaluating the compliance of software and
processes with them. In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on
chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), in-context-learning (ICL), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) to extract privacy behaviors from various software documents
prior to and during software development, and then generate privacy
requirements in the format of user stories. Our results show that most commonly
used LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama 3, can identify privacy behaviors and
generate privacy user stories with F1 scores exceeding 0.8. We also show that
the performance of these models could be improved through parameter-tuning. Our
findings provide insight into using and optimizing LLMs for generating privacy
requirements given software documents created prior to or throughout the
software development lifecycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic exploration of LLM development challenges using software engineering approaches.

Method: Analyzes the LLM development lifecycle in six phases: requirements engineering, dataset construction, model development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Result: Identifies key challenges and potential research directions for each phase of LLM development.

Conclusion: Provides insights from a software engineering perspective to advance LLM development.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has redefined
artificial intelligence (AI), pushing the boundaries of AI research and
enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However,
LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle,
yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions
from the perspective of software engineering (SE) approaches. To fill the gap,
we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development
lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset
construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation,
deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by
identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research
directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable
insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM
development.

*Mingfei Cheng,Renzhi Wang,Xiaofei Xie,Yuan Zhou,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: STCLocker is a technique for testing deadlock scenarios in multi-AV systems, outperforming baselines in generating deadlock-prone situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ADS testing focuses on single-AV settings, neglecting cooperative performance and deadlock risks in multi-AV traffic.

Method: STCLocker uses Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation to detect and generate deadlock scenarios.

Result: STCLocker generates more DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs) than the best-performing baseline on Roach and OpenCDA ADSs.

Conclusion: STCLocker effectively addresses the gap in testing cooperative deadlock avoidance in multi-AV systems.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing
techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV
settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes
crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding
deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a
circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.
Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks
remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first
dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,
STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs
controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker
consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and
Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable
black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a
given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation
collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial
conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive
behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby
increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We
evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,
a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results
show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing
baseline.

*Stanislav Sedukhin,Yoichi Tomioka,Kazuya Matsumoto,Yuichi Okuyama*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TriADA, a novel approach for efficient trilinear transformations in HPC and AI, addressing computational and energy challenges with parallel algorithms and specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory demands of multilinear transformations in HPC and AI, especially for sparse data, hinder performance and scalability.

Method: Proposes TriADA: (1) parallel low-rank algorithm for 3D-DXTs, (2) outer-product-based GEMM kernel, (3) distributed 3D mesh architecture, (4) ESOP for sparse data efficiency.

Result: TriADA achieves hypercubic arithmetic complexity in linear time-steps, enhancing energy efficiency and scalability for tensor operations.

Conclusion: TriADA is a scalable, energy-efficient solution for accelerating demanding multilinear tensor operations in AI and HPC.

Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and
artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors.
However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with
dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation
by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases
energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data,
which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear
Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address
these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel,
low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal
transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode
matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM
kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate
3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully
distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with
a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent
of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids
unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands,
thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability.
TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with
hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The
massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is
ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most
demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to distributed architectures and emerging technologies like Generative AI necessitates updated performance metrics to meet evolving computational and application needs.

Method: The paper reviews existing metrics in DCC and IoT environments and introduces emerging dimensions like sustainability and system observability.

Result: Identifies gaps in traditional metrics and proposes expanded criteria for performance measurement to align with current and future computing demands.

Conclusion: The study aims to guide future research by highlighting the need for adaptable performance metrics in DCC, emphasizing sustainability and efficiency.

Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large,
centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise
of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers
such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work
together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of
Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for
computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance
metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and
expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application
requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers
and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with
system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT
environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address
evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system
observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting
appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this
critical area.

*Jinliang Shi,Shigang Li,Youxuan Xu,Xueying Wang,Rongtian Fu,Zhi Ma,Tong Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Libra optimizes sparse matrix multiplication by synergizing CUDA and Tensor cores, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern accelerators' limitations (Tensor cores for structured matrices, CUDA cores for flexibility) hinder sparse matrix multiplication performance.

Method: Libra uses a 2D-aware workload distribution, hybrid load-balancing, optimized kernels, and GPU-accelerated preprocessing to leverage both core types.

Result: Libra outperforms DTC-SpMM by 3.1x (up to 9.23x) and improves GNN applications by 2.9x (up to 3.9x).

Conclusion: Libra demonstrates the potential of heterogeneous GPU resource exploitation for sparse operator acceleration.

Abstract: Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used
in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly
equipped with Tensor cores and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The
former brings superior computing power but only for structured matrix
multiplication, while the latter has relatively lower performance but with
higher programming flexibility. In this work, we discover that utilizing one
resource alone leads to inferior performance for sparse matrix multiplication,
due to their respective limitations. To this end, we propose Libra, a
systematic approach that enables synergistic computation between CUDA and
Tensor cores to achieve the best performance for sparse matrix multiplication.
Specifically, we propose a 2D-aware workload distribution strategy to find out
the sweet point of task mapping for different sparse operators, leveraging both
the high performance of Tensor cores and the low computational redundancy on
CUDA cores. In addition, Libra incorporates systematic optimizations for
heterogeneous computing, including hybrid load-balancing, finely optimized
kernel implementations, and GPU-accelerated preprocessing. Extensive
experimental results on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs show that Libra outperforms the
state-of-the-art by on average 3.1x (up to 9.23x) over DTC-SpMM and 2.9x (up to
3.9x) for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for
sparse operator acceleration by fully exploiting the heterogeneous computing
resources on GPUs.

TL;DR: SCARF is a framework assessing water impact in computing by considering spatial and temporal water stress, introducing an Adjusted Water Impact (AWI) metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current water impact assessments neglect spatial and temporal water stress, which is critical for sustainable computing as AI workloads grow.

Method: SCARF evaluates water impact using AWI, factoring in consumption volume and local water stress over time.

Result: Case studies on LLM serving, datacenters, and semiconductor plants reveal opportunities to reduce water impact by optimizing location and timing.

Conclusion: SCARF enables water-sustainable computing by highlighting the importance of spatial and temporal considerations in water impact assessments.

Abstract: Water consumption is an increasingly critical dimension of computing
sustainability, especially as AI workloads rapidly scale. However, current
water impact assessment often overlooks where and when water stress is more
severe. To fill in this gap, we present SCARF, the first general framework that
evaluates water impact of computing by factoring in both spatial and temporal
variations in water stress. SCARF calculates an Adjusted Water Impact (AWI)
metric that considers both consumption volume and local water stress over time.
Through three case studies on LLM serving, datacenters, and semiconductor
fabrication plants, we show the hidden opportunities for reducing water impact
by optimizing location and time choices, paving the way for water-sustainable
computing. The code is available at https://github.com/jojacola/SCARF.

Motivation: Addressing cost and scalability challenges in building private LLM systems for personal or small group services, inspired by Apple Intelligence.

Method: Utilizing a Mac Studio cluster with M2 Ultra chips to host and accelerate the DBRX model (MoE architecture), analyzing parallel execution and network latency.

Result: The cluster is 1.15x more cost-efficient than NVIDIA H100 GPUs, with optimized memory management and a performance model for system design.

Conclusion: The Mac Studio cluster offers a viable, cost-efficient solution for private LLM systems, with insights for future designs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI)
with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and
Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges
encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group
services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2
Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate
the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our
performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts
across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find
that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time
for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency
over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple
software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop
optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result,
the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the
state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we
construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying
configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private
LLM systems.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive inference system for edge devices, optimizing model quantization and workload partitioning to balance accuracy, time, and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices vary in computational capabilities and constraints, requiring flexible inference solutions beyond fixed pre-trained models.

Method: Introduces a joint optimization framework for model quantization and inference partitioning, considering device capabilities and accuracy needs.

Result: Simulations show over 80% reduction in computation payloads with less than 1% accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: The system efficiently adapts to diverse edge scenarios, improving cost and performance while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to
diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes
more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future
inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an
inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's
computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more
cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an
accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint
model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server
dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and
adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the
device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are
considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference
system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach
optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize
time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of
tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our
knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing
quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by
introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results
demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with
computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below
1%.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Agent.xpu is a system for efficiently managing agentic LLM workloads on heterogeneous SoCs, balancing low-latency reactive tasks and high-throughput proactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing on-device LLM engines are inefficient for concurrent reactive and proactive tasks on heterogeneous SoCs.

Method: Agent.xpu uses offline profiling to create a heterogeneous execution graph, employs kernel-level preemption for reactive tasks, and optimizes throughput with slack-aware backfill and bandwidth-aware dispatch.

Result: Agent.xpu reduces reactive task latency by 4.6× and increases proactive task throughput by 1.6×-6.8× compared to state-of-the-art engines.

Conclusion: Agent.xpu effectively addresses the challenges of concurrent agentic LLM workloads on heterogeneous SoCs, improving both latency and throughput.

Abstract: The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices
introduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.
Reactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,
while proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing
on-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently
manage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade
heterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces
Agent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on
memory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu
first constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model
kernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel
annotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level
preemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC
utilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append
proactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware
dispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves
4.6$\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains
1.6$\times$-6.8$\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to
state-of-the-art inference engines.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for Cyber-Physical Systems is proposed, with global and local controllers. Two optimization frameworks (COpt and FOpt) are introduced for local controllers, with theoretical guarantees on optimal policies and value functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address control challenges in Cyber-Physical Systems by leveraging hierarchical decentralized control with varying timescales and autonomy levels.

Method: The architecture includes a global controller (slow timescale) and local controllers (fast timescale), modeled as MDPs. Two frameworks (COpt and FOpt) are proposed for local control, with analysis of their properties and relationships.

Result: Existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies is proven. Bounds on value function differences and conditions for identical optimal values are provided.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture and frameworks offer flexible and theoretically grounded control solutions for Cyber-Physical Systems, balancing autonomy and optimization.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture
for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$
independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each
formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating
at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative
reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a
faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the
COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an
infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller
optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure,
where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First,
the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these
frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two
frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two
optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such
that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive experimental design for identifying the best treatment arm efficiently, combining a two-stage allocation phase with a choice phase, proving it is asymptotically optimal for both minimax and Bayes objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently identify the best treatment arm (highest expected outcome) in fixed-budget best-arm identification problems, balancing minimax and Bayesian optimality.

Method: A two-stage adaptive procedure: pilot phase (uniform allocation) to eliminate suboptimal arms and estimate variances, followed by variance-proportional allocation. The best arm is chosen based on the highest sample mean.

Result: The design is proven asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for simple regret, with matching upper and lower bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed experiment achieves sharp efficiency limits without separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.

Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice,
also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive
procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a
treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to
efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the
highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation
phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we
allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate
clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we
allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first
stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the
treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest
sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this
single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for
the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact
constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency
limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.

Method: Analyzes the impact of posterior drift on forecasting accuracy, focusing on equity premium forecasting and varying model complexity (bandwidth parameters).

Result: Finds that smaller bandwidths lead to heterogeneous returns, while larger bandwidths offer consistency but lower risk-adjusted returns.

Conclusion: Recommends caution when using large linear models for stock market predictions due to sensitivity to regime changes.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of posterior drift on out-of-sample
forecasting accuracy in overparametrized machine learning models. We document
the loss in performance when the loadings of the data generating process change
between the training and testing samples. This matters crucially in settings in
which regime changes are likely to occur, for instance, in financial markets.
Applied to equity premium forecasting, our results underline the sensitivity of
a market timing strategy to sub-periods and to the bandwidth parameters that
control the complexity of the model. For the average investor, we find that
focusing on holding periods of 15 years can generate very heterogeneous
returns, especially for small bandwidths. Large bandwidths yield much more
consistent outcomes, but are far less appealing from a risk-adjusted return
standpoint. All in all, our findings tend to recommend cautiousness when
resorting to large linear models for stock market predictions.

### [625] [Supervised Diffusion-Model-Based PET Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24034)
*George Webber,Alexander Hammers,Andrew P King,Andrew J Reader*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A supervised diffusion model (DM) for PET image reconstruction is proposed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by integrating Poisson likelihood and handling PET's intensity range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised DM-based PET reconstruction lacks explicit modeling of DM prior and noisy data interaction, limiting accuracy.

Method: A supervised DM algorithm enforces PET's Poisson likelihood non-negativity and accommodates PET's intensity range, validated on brain PET phantoms.

Result: Outperforms or matches deep learning methods across dose levels; enables accurate posterior sampling and uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: The supervised DM approach improves PET reconstruction accuracy and uncertainty estimation, with practical 3D PET application demonstrated.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced as a regularizing prior
for PET image reconstruction, integrating DMs trained on high-quality PET
images with unsupervised schemes that condition on measured data. While these
approaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence
from the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the
opportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy
measurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address
this, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our
method enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and
accommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on
realistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a
range of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on
training data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps. Additionally, we
show that our approach enables more accurate posterior sampling than
unsupervised DM-based methods, suggesting improved uncertainty estimation.
Finally, we extend our methodology to a practical approach for fully 3D PET and
present example results from real [$^{18}$F]FDG brain PET data.

### [626] [VoteSplat: Hough Voting Gaussian Splatting for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22799)
*Minchao Jiang,Shunyu Jia,Jiaming Gu,Xiaoyuan Lu,Guangming Zhu,Anqi Dong,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VoteSplat integrates Hough voting with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for enhanced 3D scene understanding, reducing training costs and improving localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods lack deeper scene understanding and have high training costs, limiting their efficiency and applicability.

Method: VoteSplat uses SAM for instance segmentation, embeds spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives, and refines depth localization with distortion constraints. It maps 2D semantics to 3D point clouds via voting.

Result: VoteSplat excels in open-vocabulary 3D instance localization, point cloud understanding, and hierarchical segmentation, with reduced training costs.

Conclusion: VoteSplat effectively combines 3DGS with Hough voting, improving scene understanding while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time
rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods
focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene
understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the
originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we
propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates
Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized
for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We
then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets
construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth
distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For
open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D
point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with
high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D
instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object
localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies. Our code is

TL;DR: ICP-3DGS improves camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis by combining ICP with optimization-based refinement and voxel-based densification, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural rendering methods like NeRFs and 3DGS rely on preprocessed camera poses and 3D priors, which are hard to obtain outdoors. This work addresses the challenge of accurate pose estimation in large-scale scenes.

Method: Proposes ICP with optimization-based refinement for pose estimation and voxel-based densification for large-scale scene reconstruction.

Result: ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in pose estimation and novel view synthesis across indoor and outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations of neural rendering methods in outdoor scenarios, offering improved accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and
novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses
and 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are
challenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based
refinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera
movements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification
approach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in both
camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis across indoor and outdoor
scenes of various scales. Source code is available at

### [628] [Navigating with Annealing Guidance Scale in Diffusion Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24108)
*Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an annealing guidance scheduler to dynamically adjust the guidance scale in diffusion models, improving text-to-image generation quality and prompt alignment without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in diffusion models depends heavily on the guidance scale, which impacts image quality and prompt alignment. Current fixed-scale methods are temperamental.

Method: Proposes an annealing guidance scheduler that dynamically adjusts the guidance scale during sampling based on the conditional noisy signal, learning a scheduling policy to optimize performance.

Result: Empirical results show the scheduler enhances image quality and prompt alignment, outperforming fixed-scale CFG without additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: The annealing guidance scheduler offers a better trade-off between prompt alignment and image quality, seamlessly replacing fixed-scale CFG in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images
conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful
guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a
widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel lossy compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting uses learnable confidence scores to prune low-confidence splats, reducing storage and computational overhead while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting produces millions of splats, leading to excessive storage and computational costs, necessitating an efficient compression method.

Method: Proposes a compression technique using Beta-distributed confidence scores optimized via reconstruction-aware losses to prune splats without compromising fidelity.

Result: Achieves favorable trade-offs between compression and visual fidelity, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The approach is architecture-agnostic, effective, and introduces confidence scores as a quality metric for scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often
produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational
overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable
confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is
optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of
low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant.
In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the
quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs
between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GaVS is a novel 3D-grounded video stabilization method that uses local reconstruction and rendering to address issues like distortions and cropping, outperforming existing 2D and 2.5D approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video stabilization methods suffer from geometric distortions, excessive cropping, and poor generalization, degrading user experience.

Method: GaVS reformulates stabilization as a temporally-consistent local reconstruction and rendering paradigm, using 3D camera poses, Gaussian Splatting, and test-time finetuning with photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization.

Result: Quantitatively competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods; qualitatively better results, validated by user study.

Conclusion: GaVS effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved stabilization with geometry consistency.

Abstract: Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted
shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing
approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues
(e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that
degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce
\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video
stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'
paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict
Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view
dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to
produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to
render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid
frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with
3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene
dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to
state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics
and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably
better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.

*Jens Winkler,Michael Denhard*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) to initial condition errors using Arnoldi-SV perturbations, demonstrating its applicability to both MLWP and NWP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weather forecasts are uncertain, requiring reliable likelihoods of future scenarios. The study aims to understand error growth in MLWP models like Pangu Weather.

Method: The Arnoldi-SV (A-SV) method, which doesn't need linear/adjoint models, iteratively applies forecast models to perturbed states to observe error growth and identify unstable modes.

Result: A-SV successfully identifies dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather model, showing error growth from the start.

Conclusion: A-SV transforms noise into conditioned perturbations, useful for initializing MLWP ensembles, with parallels to diffusion-based ML models like GenCast.

Abstract: Since weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, reliable decision making
requires information on the likelihoods of future weather scenarios. We explore
the sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h
Pangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a
specific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)
method does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to
numerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth
within a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast
model to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly
based on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each
iteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are
expected to turn into directions of growing errors. We show that A-SV indeed
finds dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather
model, which grow right from the beginning of the forecast rollout. These
perturbations describe local unstable modes and could be a basis to initialize
MLWP ensembles. Since we start A-SV from random noise perturbations, the
algorithm transforms noise into perturbations conditioned on a given reference
state - a process that is akin to the denoising process of the generic
diffusion based ML model of GenCast, therefor we briefly discuss similarities
and differences.

TL;DR: Deep learning methods for diagnosing misalignments in multi-lens systems using optical measurements, achieving high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional alignment methods are slow and require specialized equipment, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Two deep learning approaches: one using ray-traced spot diagrams for 5-DOF errors, another using synthetic camera images for 4-DOF errors.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error of 0.031mm in translation and 0.011° in tilt for 5-DOF, and demonstrated effectiveness for 4-DOF errors.

Conclusion: The methods show promise for improving manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of
multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor
misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment
methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes,
highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two
complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing
misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements.
First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom
(5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error
of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce
a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera
images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt
errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the
potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

TL;DR: TinyXRA is a lightweight, explainable transformer-based model for assessing company risk from 10-K reports, outperforming prior methods with comprehensive metrics and real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing risk assessment methods penalize both upside and downside risk indiscriminately, lacking transparency and scalability for real-world deployment.

Method: Uses TinyBERT for efficient document processing, dynamic attention-based word clouds for visualization, and triplet loss for quartile classification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on 2013-2024 data, with transparent and interpretable risk assessments.

Conclusion: TinyXRA offers scalable, explainable risk assessment with practical implications, though limitations and future research directions are noted.

Abstract: Every publicly traded U.S. company files an annual 10-K report containing
critical insights into financial health and risk. We propose Tiny eXplainable
Risk Assessor (TinyXRA), a lightweight and explainable transformer-based model
that automatically assesses company risk from these reports. Unlike prior work
that relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for
the Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and
downside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio
for more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to
efficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic,
attention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization
while filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable
deployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing
capabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for
production systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet
loss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches
in existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk
differences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across
seven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent
and interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively
by systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and
qualitatively by examining explanation coherence. The paper concludes with
findings, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions.

Abstract: In this work we revisit the Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) algorithm

offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We
adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as

### [637] [Service Placement in Small Cell Networks Using Distributed Best Arm Identification in Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22480)
*Mariam Yahya,Aydin Sezgin,Setareh Maghsudi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses latency issues in small cell networks by using MEC and SBSs as edge servers. It models service demand and placement as a linear bandit problem, proposing a distributed multi-agent BAI algorithm to optimize service placement. Simulations confirm its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency in cloud-based access for computation-intensive services in small cell networks motivates the use of MEC and SBSs. Limited edge capacity and dynamic conditions challenge optimal service placement.

Method: Service demand is modeled as a linear function, and placement is framed as a linear bandit problem. A distributed multi-agent BAI algorithm is proposed for adaptive learning under fixed-confidence settings.

Result: Simulations show the algorithm identifies the optimal service with desired confidence and achieves near-optimal speedup. Theoretical analysis confirms its sample complexity and communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively optimizes service placement in MEC-enabled small cell networks, reducing latency and improving performance.

Abstract: As users in small cell networks increasingly rely on computation-intensive
services, cloud-based access often results in high latency. Multi-access edge
computing (MEC) mitigates this by bringing computational resources closer to
end users, with small base stations (SBSs) serving as edge servers to enable
low-latency service delivery. However, limited edge capacity makes it
challenging to decide which services to deploy locally versus in the cloud,
especially under unknown service demand and dynamic network conditions. To
tackle this problem, we model service demand as a linear function of service
attributes and formulate the service placement task as a linear bandit problem,
where SBSs act as agents and services as arms. The goal is to identify the
service that, when placed at the edge, offers the greatest reduction in total
user delay compared to cloud deployment. We propose a distributed and adaptive
multi-agent best-arm identification (BAI) algorithm under a fixed-confidence
setting, where SBSs collaborate to accelerate learning. Simulations show that
our algorithm identifies the optimal service with the desired confidence and
achieves near-optimal speedup, as the number of learning rounds decreases
proportionally with the number of SBSs. We also provide theoretical analysis of
the algorithm's sample complexity and communication overhead.

TL;DR: Geminet is a scalable ML-based Traffic Engineering framework that handles topology changes efficiently with minimal computational and memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML-based TE schemes are impractical due to poor scalability and inability to handle topology changes.

Method: Geminet decouples neural networks from topology using gradient-descent-based adjustments and shifts optimization to edge-level dual variables for reduced memory usage.

Result: Geminet achieves significant scalability improvements, with neural network sizes 0.04%-7% of existing schemes and memory usage under 10 GiB, outperforming HARP in convergence speed.

Conclusion: Geminet is a lightweight, scalable solution for large-scale TE deployment, addressing key limitations of current ML-based approaches.

Abstract: Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE),
leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by
optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they
either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to
excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can
handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a
methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an
iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of
gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related
quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to
edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact
that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center
datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural
network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology
variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach,
without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies,
Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the
80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence
speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.

AI/ML and evolving Telco infrastructure. This paper introduces Kubernetes
Network Drivers (KNDs), a transformative, modular, and declarative architecture
designed to overcome current imperative provisioning and API limitations. KNDs
integrate network resource management into Kubernetes' core by utilizing
Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), Node Resource Interface (NRI) improvements,
and upcoming OCI Runtime Specification changes. Our DraNet implementation
demonstrates declarative attachment of network interfaces, including Remote
Direct Memory Access (RDMA) devices, significantly boosting high-performance
AI/ML workloads. This capability enables sophisticated cloud-native
applications and lays crucial groundwork for future Telco solutions, fostering
a "galaxy" of specialized KNDs for enhanced application delivery and reduced
operational complexity.

### [641] [Learning Constraints Directly from Network Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23964)
*Hongyu Hè,Minhao Jin,Maria Apostolaki*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: NetNomos learns propositional logic constraints from network data to improve synthetic data quality, ML robustness, and semantic understanding, outperforming baseline methods in rule extraction efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network data follows implicit rules from protocols and designs, but manual or ML-based rule extraction is incomplete or unreliable. Formalizing these rules can enhance data quality, ML models, and measurement understanding.

Method: NetNomos formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem, using lattice-based search for efficiency, reducing learning complexity from superquadratic to logarithmic.

Result: NetNomos learns all benchmark rules, even rare ones (0.01% data points), in under three hours, while baselines find <25% and take days. Case studies show its utility in traffic generation, anomaly detection, and telemetry.

Conclusion: NetNomos effectively automates rule extraction from network data, offering practical benefits for synthetic data, anomaly detection, and monitoring.

Abstract: Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols,
design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay
must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic
constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the
brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic
understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of
reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches
yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.
  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and
introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from
raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely
challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and
passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos
addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint
specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from
superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial
search space.
  Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all
benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data
points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than
25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies,
we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven
synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their
generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be
used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for
telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes WELAI, a paradigm shift from passive to active AI in wireless systems, addressing real-time dynamics and environmental probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for wireless systems rely on offline data, missing real-time dynamics and active probing capabilities, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces WELAI, outlining its design principles, system structure, and a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Result: WELAI shows promise in handling real-time wireless dynamics and non-stationary environments, enabling adaptive and autonomous systems.

Conclusion: WELAI represents a significant advancement for next-generation wireless systems, with potential for adaptive, robust, and autonomous performance.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models offer revolutionary potential for
future wireless systems, promising unprecedented capabilities in network
optimization and performance. However, current paradigms largely overlook
crucial physical interactions. This oversight means they primarily rely on
offline datasets, leading to difficulties in handling real-time wireless
dynamics and non-stationary environments. Furthermore, these models often lack
the capability for active environmental probing. This paper proposes a
fundamental paradigm shift towards wireless embodied large AI (WELAI), moving
from passive observation to active embodiment. We first identify key challenges
faced by existing models, then we explore the design principles and system
structure of WELAI. Besides, we outline prospective applications in
next-generation wireless. Finally, through an illustrative case study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of WELAI and point out promising research
directions for realizing adaptive, robust, and autonomous wireless systems.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Human Digital Twin (HDT) system integrating conversational AI and personal data to create interactive digital counterparts, addressing ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance HDTs by making them more authentic and interactive using conversational AI and personal data.

Method: Uses large language models with dynamic personal data, context-aware memory retrieval, neural plasticity-inspired consolidation, and adaptive learning.

Result: The system replicates conversational styles and enriches responses with personal experiences, opinions, and memories.

Conclusion: The study advances HDTs but highlights ethical challenges like privacy and accountability for responsible development.

Abstract: Human Digital Twins (HDTs) have traditionally been conceptualized as
data-driven models designed to support decision-making across various domains.
However, recent advancements in conversational AI open new possibilities for
HDTs to function as authentic, interactive digital counterparts of individuals.
This paper introduces a novel HDT system architecture that integrates large
language models with dynamically updated personal data, enabling it to mirror
an individual's conversational style, memories, and behaviors. To achieve this,
our approach implements context-aware memory retrieval, neural
plasticity-inspired consolidation, and adaptive learning mechanisms, creating a
more natural and evolving digital persona. The resulting system does not only
replicate an individual's unique conversational style depending on who they are
speaking with, but also enriches responses with dynamically captured personal
experiences, opinions, and memories. While this marks a significant step toward
developing authentic virtual counterparts, it also raises critical ethical
concerns regarding privacy, accountability, and the long-term implications of
persistent digital identities. This study contributes to the field of HDTs by
describing our novel system architecture, demonstrating its capabilities, and
discussing future directions and emerging challenges to ensure the responsible
and ethical development of HDTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs can assist in medical decision-making, particularly in solving the treatment problem, and to highlight associated challenges.

Method: The study discusses approaches like trials and observational data within evidence-based medicine, contrasts the treatment and chat problems, and evaluates LLMs' role in addressing these.

Result: Identifies challenges in using LLMs for the treatment problem and relates these to evidence-based medicine.

Conclusion: The findings can guide future steps in integrating LLMs into medical decision-making while addressing identified challenges.

Abstract: Large language models are thought to have potential to aid in medical
decision making. We investigate this here. We start with the treatment problem,
the patient's core medical decision-making task, which is solved in
collaboration with a healthcare provider. We discuss approaches to solving the
treatment problem, including -- within evidence-based medicine -- trials and
observational data. We then discuss the chat problem, and how this differs from
the treatment problem -- in particular as it relates to imitation. We then
discuss how a large language model might be used to solve the treatment problem
and highlight some of the challenges that emerge. We finally discuss how these
challenges relate to evidence-based medicine, and how this might inform next
steps.

*Gabriel M. Mejia,Henry E. Miller,Francis J. A. Leblanc,Bo Wang,Brendan Swain,Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper highlights a metric artifact in single-cell perturbation response models, where mode collapse is rewarded due to biased controls or sparse signals. It introduces DEG-aware metrics (WMSE and weighted delta R²) to improve sensitivity and calibrates them with baselines. Using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and enhances model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the anomaly where models for single-cell perturbation response are outperformed by predicting the dataset mean, due to flawed metrics rewarding mode collapse.

Method: Proposes DEG-aware metrics (WMSE and weighted delta R²) and introduces performance baselines. Validates through simulations and real-world datasets.

Result: The mean baseline performs poorly with the new metrics, while genuine predictors are accurately rewarded. WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves performance.

Conclusion: The introduced metrics and baselines correct flawed evaluations, ensuring genuine biological signals are measured accurately, and WMSE enhances model training.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response
are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this
anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error
metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological
signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of
two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not
genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We
introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted
mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with
respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high
sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines
to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to
null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we
show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves
model performance.

### [646] [Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22555)
*Callum Duffy,Marcin Jastrzebski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores spectral bias in quantum machine learning, showing that parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) exhibit frequency-dependent convergence due to Fourier coefficient redundancy, influenced by data encoding. Gradient magnitudes correlate with redundancy, and higher redundancy improves robustness to parameter perturbations. Design choices like initialization scale and entanglement structure impact learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand spectral bias in quantum machine learning, specifically in PQCs, and how it affects learning dynamics and robustness.

Method: Analyzed PQCs as Fourier series, studied redundancy of Fourier coefficients, and empirically tested three encoding schemes. Investigated gradient magnitudes and robustness to perturbations. Explored design choices like initialization and entanglement.

Result: Spectral bias in PQCs arises from Fourier coefficient redundancy, dictated by encoding. Gradient magnitudes correlate with redundancy. Higher redundancy enhances robustness. Large initializations and low-entanglement slow convergence.

Conclusion: Spectral bias in PQCs is tied to Fourier coefficient redundancy, influenced by encoding and design choices, impacting learning efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum
machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit
low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than
high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence.
We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs).
Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that
spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier
coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the
model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding
scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find
that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training
strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further
demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes.
Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit
increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the
corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability
of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and
entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement
schemes tend to slow convergence.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-rank block tensor train decomposition for efficient quantum state tomography, addressing the impracticality of standard methods due to exponential parameter growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quantum state tomography methods are impractical for large systems due to exponential parameter growth, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: The authors parameterize the quantum state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition, ensuring memory and computational efficiency.

Result: The method is shown to be efficient for a broad class of quantum states, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical solution for quantum state tomography in large systems by leveraging low-rank decompositions.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the
state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in
evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation
methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the
state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing
the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate
that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework
applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by
low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground
states of Hamiltonians.

*Rahul Kumar,Wenqi Wei,Ying Mao,Junaid Farooq,Ying Wang,Juntao Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: SQUASH is a stealthy circuit-level attack on Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) by inserting SWAP gates, degrading performance without detectable input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in HQNNs by directly manipulating their quantum circuits, unlike traditional noise or adversarial input attacks.

Method: Insert SWAP gate(s) into the HQNN's variational quantum circuit, causing qubit misalignment and disrupting state evolution.

Result: Untargeted attacks reduce accuracy by 74.08%; targeted attacks reduce target class accuracy by 79.78%.

Conclusion: HQNNs are vulnerable to circuit-level attacks like SQUASH, highlighting the need for more resilient architectures.

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to
sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks.
SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum
circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial
input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to
qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is
highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce
detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH
significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks
reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target
class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability
in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures
against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

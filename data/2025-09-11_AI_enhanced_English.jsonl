Most existing\nliterature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in\nregression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is\nequally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous\nattributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In\npractice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,\nmethods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called\n\"fairness gerrymandering\", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional\nsubgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we\npropose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the\nassociation between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with\nthe fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear\nand nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of\nmultiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two\nmultivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously\nproposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance\ncovariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both\nregression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various\ntypes. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,\nincluding a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies\ndissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups.

To fill the gap\nof the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the\nHausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski\n(CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich\nthe studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation\nability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but\nthe information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the\nCF-H distance. To balance the anti-perturbation ability and information\nutilization of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance, the cognitive fuzzy\ncombined (CF-C) distance is proposed by establishing the linear combination of\nthe CF-IM distance and CF-H distance. Based on the CF-C distance, a\ncombined-distanced-based score function of CFS is proposed to compare CFSs. The\nproposed score function is employed in lung cancer pain evaluation issues.

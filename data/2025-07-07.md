### [2] [Underwater Monocular Metric Depth Estimation: Real-World Benchmarks and Synthetic Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02148)
*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark study evaluates monocular depth estimation models in underwater environments, highlighting poor performance of terrestrial-trained models and proposing a fine-tuned solution using synthetic underwater data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments pose challenges like light attenuation and lack of ground-truth data, limiting the reliability of monocular depth estimation.

Method: Evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned models on underwater datasets (FLSea, SQUID); fine-tuned Depth Anything V2 with synthetic underwater data from Hypersim.

Result: Terrestrial-trained models perform poorly underwater; fine-tuned model improves performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision are crucial for robust underwater depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

### [3] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)
*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ESTR-CoT, a chain-of-thought reasoning framework for event stream scene text recognition, addressing interpretability and contextual reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack interpretability and contextual reasoning in event stream text recognition.

Method: Uses EVA-CLIP for vision tokens, Llama tokenizer for prompts, and Vicuna-7B for reasoning. Trained with a large-scale CoT dataset.

Result: Validated on EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15* datasets, showing effectiveness and interpretability.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT improves interpretability and reasoning in event stream text recognition, with code and models to be released.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

### [4] [Team RAS in 9th ABAW Competition: Multimodal Compound Expression Recognition Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02205)
*Elena Ryumina,Maxim Markitantov,Alexandr Axyonov,Dmitry Ryumin,Mikhail Dolgushin,Alexey Karpov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot multimodal approach for Compound Expression Recognition (CER) combines six modalities and achieves competitive results without domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic emotions without relying on task-specific training data.

Method: Uses zero-shot components like CLIP and Qwen-VL, introduces Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF), and Compound Expressions (CE) transformation with PPA and PFSA.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 46.95% (AffWild2), 49.02% (AFEW), and 34.85% (C-EXPR-DB), comparable to supervised methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures compound emotions without domain adaptation, demonstrating its potential for CER.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

### [5] [SciGA: A Comprehensive Dataset for Designing Graphical Abstracts in Academic Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02212)
*Takuro Kawada,Shunsuke Kitada,Sota Nemoto,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGA-145k, a dataset for Graphical Abstracts (GAs) research, proposing tasks for GA recommendation and a new metric (CAR) to improve GA selection and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scientific communication by addressing the lack of exploration in GA potential and the barrier of advanced visualization skills for GA design.

Method: Creation of SciGA-145k dataset (145k papers, 1.14M figures) and definition of two tasks: Intra-GA and Inter-GA recommendation, with baseline models and the CAR metric.

Result: SciGA-145k supports GA research, providing tasks and metrics for improved GA selection and generation.

Conclusion: The dataset and proposed framework advance visual scientific communication and AI for Science.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [6] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using diffusion models for synthetic data generation in object detection, comparing prompt-based and layout-based conditioning. Layout conditioning outperforms when cues match the training distribution, significantly boosting detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited training data in industrial vision systems, the paper investigates synthetic data generation to bridge the gap between simulation and reality efficiently.

Method: The study compares two conditioning strategies (prompt-based and layout-based) for diffusion models across 80 visual concepts from standard benchmarks.

Result: Layout conditioning excels with diverse cues, improving mean average precision by up to 177% compared to real data alone.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with layout conditioning offer a scalable solution for high-quality synthetic data, enhancing object detection performance in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

### [7] [High-Fidelity Differential-information Driven Binary Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02222)
*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT is a novel binary vision transformer that addresses performance degradation in existing binary ViTs by incorporating differential information in attention and improving activation functions, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate severe performance degradation and reliance on full-precision modules in existing binary ViTs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Introduces an informative attention module with differential information, frequency decomposition using Haar wavelet, and an improved RPReLU activation function.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods in ViT architectures, excelling in image classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it suitable for edge-device deployment.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

### [8] [FMOcc: TPV-Driven Flow Matching for 3D Occupancy Prediction with Selective State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02250)
*Jiangxia Chen,Tongyuan Huang,Ke Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by refining features with flow matching and selective state space models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction suffer from limitations in handling occluded and distant scenes due to few-frame images and redundant 3D space, requiring additional data and resources.

Method: FMOcc introduces a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement network with flow matching (FMSSM) and selective state space models (PS3M) to enhance feature generation and filtering. Mask Training (MT) is added for robustness.

Result: FMOcc achieves 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes, and 42.6% RayIoU on OpenOcc, with efficient inference (5.4 G memory, 330ms).

Conclusion: FMOcc addresses key challenges in 3D occupancy prediction, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

*Zeyu Lei,Hongyuan Yu,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgVisAgent, an intelligent surgical vision agent using multimodal large language models, dynamically enhances endoscopic images for various distortions, outperforming single-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing enhancement algorithms are limited to single tasks, reducing their effectiveness in complex surgical scenarios.

Method: Leverages multimodal large language models, a prior model for domain knowledge, and in-context few-shot learning with chain-of-thought reasoning for customized enhancements.

Result: Outperforms traditional single-task models on a comprehensive benchmark simulating real-world surgical distortions.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent is a promising unified solution for diverse surgical image enhancement needs.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

### [10] [Multi-Label Classification Framework for Hurricane Damage Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02265)
*Zhangding Liu,Neda Mohammadi,John E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-label classification framework using aerial imagery improves post-hurricane damage assessment, outperforming baselines with 90.23% mean average precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label methods fail to capture the complexity of post-hurricane damage, necessitating a more accurate and timely assessment for disaster response.

Method: The framework combines ResNet-based feature extraction with a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types in a single image.

Result: Achieves 90.23% mean average precision on the Rescuenet dataset, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances damage assessment, aiding targeted disaster response and future mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

### [11] [Cross-domain Hyperspectral Image Classification based on Bi-directional Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02268)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification, enhancing adaptability and separability by extracting domain-invariant and domain-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spectral shifts in hyperspectral images from different regions or times by improving cross-domain classification.

Method: Uses a triple-branch transformer with semantic tokenizer, coupled multi-head cross-attention, bi-directional distillation loss, and adaptive reinforcement strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3-5% in cross-temporal tree species classification.

Conclusion: BiDA effectively improves cross-domain HSI classification by leveraging domain-invariant and domain-specific features.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be
available from the website:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAC-Lookup, a model for enhancing underwater images by improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast, outperforming traditional and deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from visibility and color issues due to environmental factors, and existing methods (prior-based, pixel-based, or deep learning) are inadequate due to limitations like lack of datasets.

Method: The MAC-Lookup model combines Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for initial color correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement, avoiding over-enhancement.

Result: Experiments show MAC-Lookup restores details and colors better than existing methods.

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup effectively addresses underwater image enhancement challenges, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

*Feizhen Huang,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-distillation method improves Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation by incorporating cinematic language, enhancing performance in partial visibility scenarios and on the VGGSound dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods ignore cinematic language, limiting their effectiveness when Foley targets are partially visible.

Method: Proposes a self-distillation approach where a student model learns to align video features with audio-visual correspondences by simulating cinematic language variations.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in partial visibility scenarios and outperforms on the VGGSound dataset.

Conclusion: The method successfully integrates cinematic language into V2A generation, improving robustness and performance.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

*Juntao Liu,Liqiang Niu,Wenchao Chen,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaCo introduces layer-wise visual token compression within vision encoder intermediate layers, improving efficiency and performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods for MLLMs are post-encoder, limiting efficiency gains. LaCo addresses this by compressing tokens within the encoder.

Method: LaCo uses a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism and residual learning with non-parametric shortcuts for token compression.

Result: LaCo outperforms existing methods, improving training efficiency by over 20% and inference throughput by 15% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: LaCo is a superior framework for visual token compression, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in MLLMs.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

### [15] [Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02288)
*De Cheng,Zhipeng Xu,Xinyang Jiang,Dongsheng Li,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for domain generalization (DG) leverages text-guided visual prompt tuning and worst explicit representation alignment (WERA) to enhance domain-invariant feature learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of designing prompts for disentangling invariant features across diverse domains in DG, utilizing the controllable text modality of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs).

Method: Proposes text feature-guided visual prompt tuning, using LLM-disentangled text prompts and WERA for abstract prompt augmentation to align visual representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods on major datasets like PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines text and visual modalities for domain-invariant learning, with WERA enhancing robustness through augmented diversity.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

*Hanbo Bi,Yulong Xu,Ya Li,Yongqiang Mao,Boyuan Tong,Chongyang Li,Chunbo Lang,Wenhui Diao,Hongqi Wang,Yingchao Feng,Xian Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRefSAM enhances SAM for remote sensing by automating prompts and adapting to domain-specific features using few-shot learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with manual prompts and domain adaptability in remote sensing, especially for dense or novel objects.

Method: ViRefSAM introduces a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder and Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to automate prompts and align domain features.

Result: ViRefSAM achieves accurate segmentation of unseen classes with few reference images, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM effectively addresses SAM's limitations in remote sensing, enabling efficient and accurate segmentation.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

*Yunhan Yang,Shuo Chen,Yukun Huang,Xiaoyang Wu,Yuan-Chen Guo,Edmund Y. Lam,Hengshuang Zhao,Tong He,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamComposer++ improves novel view synthesis by integrating multi-view conditions into pre-trained diffusion models, enhancing controllability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with controllable novel view generation due to limited multi-view information.

Method: Uses a view-aware 3D lifting module and multi-view feature fusion to integrate 3D representations into diffusion models.

Result: Enhances controllability and quality of novel views, enabling better 3D object reconstruction.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ advances view-aware diffusion models, broadening applications in 3D synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

### [18] [Flow-CDNet: A Novel Network for Detecting Both Slow and Fast Changes in Bitemporal Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02307)
*Haoxuan Li,Chenxu Wei,Haodong Wang,Xiaomeng Hu,Boyuan An,Lingyan Ran,Baosen Zhang,Jin Jin,Omirzhan Taukebayev,Amirkhan Temirbayev,Junrui Liu,Xiuwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow-CDNet is a novel change detection network with two branches (optical flow and binary change detection) to detect both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images. It outperforms existing methods on the Flow-Change dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images is crucial for real-life scenarios like hazard prevention, but existing methods often overlook weak changes.

Method: Flow-CDNet uses a pyramid structure for optical flow and a ResNet-based network for binary change detection, combined with a new loss function and evaluation metric (FEPE).

Result: Quantitative experiments show Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods, and ablation studies confirm mutual enhancement between the two branches.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet effectively addresses the challenge of detecting both slow and fast changes, validated by superior performance and ablation results.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

*Pei Guo,Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMPNet, a method for weakly-supervised semantic keypoint discovery using category labels, leveraging a novel leaky max pooling layer and a learnable clustering layer for robust and interpretable keypoint detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover semantic object keypoints without strong supervision, relying only on category labels, and to ensure the keypoints are robust to object pose.

Method: Proposes a leaky max pooling (LMP) layer to encourage sparse, consistent, and diverse activations, a selection strategy for filter consistency, and a learnable clustering layer for keypoint grouping.

Result: LMPNet discovers semantic keypoints robust to pose and achieves accuracy comparable to supervised pose estimation models.

Conclusion: LMPNet is an interpretable and effective solution for weakly-supervised keypoint discovery, demonstrating strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

*Le Xu,Qi Zhang,Qixian Zhang,Hongyun Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using fMRI representations to improve semantic alignment in brain-vision decoding, enhancing object detection and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain-vision decoding methods lack fine-grained semantic alignment, leading to distorted reconstructions of semantic objects. The study aims to better understand visual perception and improve decoding models.

Method: An experimental framework injects fMRI representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, comparing downstream performance on object detection and segmentation tasks with and without fMRI data.

Result: Incorporating fMRI signals improves detection and segmentation accuracy, revealing rich multi-object semantic cues and spatial localization information in fMRI.

Conclusion: fMRI contains valuable semantic and spatial data that current models underutilize, and integrating it enhances decoding performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

### [21] [MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314)
*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC is a novel method for few-shot anomaly generation in industrial quality control, addressing three key demands: preserving normal backgrounds, precise anomaly inpainting, and semantically valid anomaly placement. It outperforms existing methods on the MVTec-AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing diffusion-based methods, which often fail to meet all three requirements of anomaly generation (background preservation, precise inpainting, and semantic validity).

Method: MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone, adds Gaussian prompt-level perturbation for diversity, and employs mask-guided spatial noise injection for texture variation. It also includes a context-aware mask alignment module.

Result: MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the MVTec-AD dataset in downstream anomaly tasks.

Conclusion: MAGIC effectively addresses the three key demands of anomaly generation, offering a robust solution for industrial quality control.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

*Zecheng Zhao,Selena Song,Tong Chen,Zhi Chen,Shazia Sadiq,Yadan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynTVA introduces a dataset and benchmark to evaluate synthetic videos' utility for text-to-video retrieval (TVR), focusing on semantic alignment and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V evaluation metrics lack insight into downstream tasks like TVR, prompting the need for a specialized benchmark.

Method: SynTVA uses 800 user queries to generate synthetic videos, annotates them for semantic alignment, and correlates VQA metrics with alignment scores.

Result: The framework identifies high-utility synthetic samples for TVR and develops an Auto-Evaluator for alignment quality estimation.

Conclusion: SynTVA enhances dataset augmentation and improves TVR outcomes by selecting quality synthetic videos.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

*Nina Konovalova,Maxim Nikolaev,Andrey Kuznetsov,Aibek Alanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InnerControl improves spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models by enforcing consistency across all denoising steps, outperforming existing methods like ControlNet++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ focus on final denoising steps, neglecting intermediate stages, which limits spatial control precision.

Method: InnerControl trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct control signals from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step, ensuring spatial consistency throughout.

Result: The method enhances control fidelity and generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance with diverse conditioning methods.

Conclusion: InnerControl, combined with techniques like ControlNet++, provides superior spatial control in diffusion models by addressing intermediate generation stages.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: The study compares Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM) for rice leaf disease classification, finding FADM superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of rice leaf diseases is crucial for effective management and yield improvement, but existing methods lack thorough comparative analysis.

Method: Uses ANN-based image processing with FADM (employing FEAs, DRAs, FSAs, and ELM) and DICDM (without FEAs), tested on multiple disease datasets via 10-fold Cross-Validation.

Result: FADM outperforms DICDM in classification performance, demonstrating higher effectiveness for rice leaf disease detection.

Conclusion: FADM shows excellent potential for improving crop health, reducing yield losses, and enhancing rice farming sustainability.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

TL;DR: Automated two-step neural network approach detects intracranial aneurysm landmarks in the Circle of Willis with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of arterial bifurcations is crucial for diagnosing intracranial aneurysms, but manual methods are inefficient and prone to errors.

Method: A two-step process: an object detection network identifies ROIs, followed by a modified U-Net for precise bifurcation location.

Result: Achieved highest performance in bifurcation detection, handling anatomical variability and close landmark proximity.

Conclusion: The method is effective for automated landmark detection in cerebral MRA scans, improving diagnosis efficiency.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

TL;DR: A lightweight YOLOv8n-based model improves shrimp disease detection with reduced computational complexity and higher accuracy, validated on custom and URPC2020 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shrimp diseases cause significant economic losses; efficient and accurate detection is needed to mitigate this.

Method: Proposes a model with RLDD detection head, C2f-EMCM module, and SegNext_Attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction and reduce complexity.

Result: Achieves 32.3% fewer parameters, 92.7% mAP@0.5 (3% improvement), and outperforms other lightweight YOLO models.

Conclusion: The model balances accuracy and efficiency, offering reliable support for shrimp disease detection.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hita is a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive image generation, improving global information capture and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla autoregressive models and tokenizers lack holistic relationships and global information in image generation.

Method: Hita uses a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable queries, sequential token arrangement, and a fusion module for information control.

Result: Hita achieves 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on ImageNet, with benefits in style transfer and in-painting.

Conclusion: Hita enhances AR image generation by better capturing global properties and improving training speed.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

TL;DR: LocalDyGS introduces a novel framework for dynamic scene reconstruction, handling both large-scale and fine-scale motions by decomposing scenes into local spaces and decoupling static/dynamic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like neural radiance fields or 3D Gaussian splatting struggle with complex, highly dynamic motions, limiting their application.

Method: LocalDyGS decomposes scenes into local spaces with seeds, decouples static and dynamic features, and combines them to generate Temporal Gaussians for motion modeling.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on fine-scale datasets and is the first to model larger, complex dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS advances dynamic scene reconstruction, offering realistic modeling of highly dynamic real-world scenes.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

*Xizhe Xue,Yang Zhou,Dawei Yan,Ying Li,Haokui Zhang,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UVLM, an underwater observation benchmark for video language models (VidLMs), addressing gaps in existing terrestrial-focused works. It ensures data quality, diversity, and task variety, demonstrating improved underwater understanding and potential benefits for in-air benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VidLMs primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, neglecting underwater observation needs. The paper aims to bridge this gap by creating a specialized benchmark.

Method: UVLM is built collaboratively by humans and AI, focusing on underwater challenges (light, turbidity, angles), data diversity (frame rates, resolutions, marine classes), and task diversity (20 types). Evaluation metrics are designed for quantitative analysis.

Result: Fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM improves underwater understanding and shows slight gains on in-air benchmarks like VideoMME and Perception text.

Conclusion: UVLM fills a critical gap in VidLM applications, offering a robust benchmark for underwater scenarios and potential cross-domain benefits.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that

*Seokyeong Lee,Sithu Aung,Junyong Choi,Seungryong Kim,Ig-Jae Kim,Junghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) using video data, robust to occlusion, and requiring no multi-view setup or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity in M3OD by leveraging video data and object point tracking.

Method: Aggregates pseudo-LiDARs of static and dynamic objects across frames via object point tracking for 3D attribute extraction.

Result: Ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is practical and effective for M3OD, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMEL is a novel MIL framework for continual learning in histopathological images, addressing localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for adaptable MIL frameworks for continual tasks in histopathological images, where existing methods fail due to large patch sizes and lack of global relationships.

Method: CoMEL includes GDAT for instance encoding, BPPL for pseudo-labeling, and OWLoRA to mitigate forgetting in classification tasks.

Result: CoMEL outperforms prior methods by up to 11.00% in bag-level accuracy and 23.4% in localization accuracy.

Conclusion: CoMEL effectively addresses continual MIL challenges, offering improved accuracy and adaptability for histopathological image analysis.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

*Taehoon Kim,Jongwook Choi,Yonghyun Jeong,Haeun Noh,Jaejun Yoo,Seungryul Baek,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deepfake detection method using pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies and a joint transformer module for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detectors miss temporal artifacts by focusing on spatial frequency spectra. This work aims to detect subtle temporal inconsistencies in deepfake videos.

Method: Uses 1D Fourier transform on the time axis per pixel, an attention proposal module, and a joint transformer to integrate temporal and spatio-temporal features.

Result: Significantly improves detection of deepfake videos by capturing unnatural movements and temporal artifacts.

Conclusion: The framework advances deepfake detection, offering robust performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

### [33] [TABNet: A Triplet Augmentation Self-Recovery Framework with Boundary-Aware Pseudo-Labels for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02399)
*Peilin Zhang,Shaouxan Wua,Jun Feng,Zhuo Jin,Zhizezhang Gao,Jingkun Chen,Yaqiong Xing,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAB Net, a weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, uses triplet augmentation and boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision to improve scribble-based segmentation, achieving results close to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble annotations are cost-effective but sparse, limiting feature learning and boundary supervision in medical image segmentation.

Method: TAB Net includes a triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module for enhanced feature learning and a boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module for accurate boundary modeling.

Result: TAB Net outperforms state-of-the-art scribble-based methods and matches fully supervised performance on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets.

Conclusion: TAB Net effectively addresses scribble annotation limitations, offering a viable alternative to fully supervised segmentation.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification, showing it outperforms supervised methods in robustness and performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife re-identification relies on annotated data, which is costly. SSL offers a way to learn from unlabeled data.

Method: Uses temporal image pairs from camera traps to train SSL models without supervision. Evaluated against supervised methods in open-world and transfer learning scenarios.

Result: SSL models are more robust with limited data and outperform supervised features in all downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SSL is a promising alternative to supervised learning for wildlife re-identification, reducing reliance on annotated data.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

*Ayantika Das,Moitreya Chaudhuri,Koushik Bhat,Keerthi Ram,Mihail Bota,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper integrates an encoder with a diffusion model to create an auto-encoding framework for structured latent representations, enabling applications like brain image analysis and artifact restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack image-specific semantic representation, which auto-encoders provide. Combining them allows structured latent space and new applications.

Method: An encoder is integrated with a diffusion model to form an auto-encoding framework. Techniques include latent space structuring for brain images, unsupervised tear artifact restoration, and JPEG artifact restoration.

Result: The framework enables structured latent representations, differentiation of brain tissue types, and unsupervised restoration of artifacts.

Conclusion: The integration of diffusion models with auto-encoders enhances semantic representation and enables novel applications in image analysis and restoration.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

TL;DR: A novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking in thermal images improves accuracy by optimizing hyperparameters in two stages, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal images are crucial for surveillance in low-visibility conditions, but their low-level features challenge accurate pedestrian tracking.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage tuning method for hyperparameter optimization, avoiding complex reidentification or motion models.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy in tracking on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset across various thermal camera conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a robust solution for real-world surveillance, enhancing tracking performance in thermal imagery.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

TL;DR: PFIP is a novel scheme for efficient face retrieval in ciphertext domains, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the time-intensive nature of face retrieval in ciphertext domains due to growing template libraries and privacy concerns.

Method: PFIP uses a preselection mechanism and packing module to enhance efficiency and flexibility in biometric systems.

Result: Achieves 100% hit rate, retrieves 1,000 ciphertext templates in 300ms, and improves retrieval efficiency by 50x.

Conclusion: PFIP is a highly efficient and accurate solution for privacy-preserving face identification.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning ensemble model using residual U-Net architectures improves structural crack detection accuracy and efficiency, outperforming traditional methods like SegNet and U-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crack detection is slow and error-prone, risking public safety. Automated, reliable methods are needed.

Method: Residual U-Net models were integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model of convolutional blocks, evaluated using IoU and DICE metrics.

Result: The ensemble model outperformed SegNet and U-Net, especially with low-resolution images, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: The ensemble model offers a reliable solution for automated structural defect monitoring, enhancing safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

*Yiming Zhong,Xiaolin Zhang,Ligang Liu,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarMakeup is a 3D makeup method for virtual avatars, ensuring realistic makeup effects with consistency, identity preservation, and fine detail control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian editing methods lack realism in makeup effects for avatars, failing in consistency, identity preservation, and detail control.

Method: AvatarMakeup uses a pretrained diffusion model for makeup transfer, employing a coarse-to-fine approach with Coherent Duplication and a Refinement Module.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality and consistency in animations.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup addresses key challenges in 3D avatar makeup, offering realistic and dynamic makeup effects.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F²TTA) for adapting models to unpredictable domain fragments in medical data, proposing Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) with Uncertainty-oriented Masking and Parallel Graph Distillation to address shifts and knowledge representation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting models to unpredictable domain fragments in medical data due to resource constraints and patient variability, where existing TTA methods fail.

Method: Proposes I-DiPT framework with image-invariant and image-specific prompts, enhanced by Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) for knowledge reuse.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in breast cancer and glaucoma classification compared to existing TTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed F²TTA and I-DiPT framework effectively handle unpredictable domain shifts in medical data, improving adaptation performance.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots slow down for object detection due to low camera framerates, increasing task time. Existing tools like Vitis-AI underutilize FPGA potential.

Method: Used FINN architecture to deploy quantized ANNs (MobileNet v1, CNV) in FPGA's PL, trained on RG2C dataset.

Result: MobileNet v1 outperformed with 98% success and 6611 FPS.

Conclusion: FPGAs can speed up ANNs for real-time attention mechanisms in robotics.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them

*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet is a zero-shot method for underexposed image restoration, eliminating the need for paired training data and avoiding over-enhancement. It uses decomposition and denoising modules to improve illumination and suppress noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods require impractical paired datasets and risk over-enhancing well-lit regions. IGDNet addresses these limitations by operating without training data or priors.

Method: IGDNet decomposes images into illumination and reflection components using a dense connection network, then enhances illumination with a pixel-adaptive correction method. Noise pairs are refined iteratively.

Result: IGDNet outperforms 14 unsupervised methods, achieving PSNR of 20.41dB and SSIM of 0.860dB, with improved visual quality under complex lighting.

Conclusion: IGDNet offers a practical, high-performance solution for underexposed image restoration without paired data, demonstrating strong generalization and noise suppression.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme for moving infrared small target detection, reducing annotation needs while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for infrared small targets is costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for non-fully supervised methods.

Method: Uses SAM for target mining, contrastive learning for pseudo-label reliability, and motion-aware learning for local and global target patterns.

Result: Outperforms early fully-supervised methods and reaches over 90% of SOTA fully-supervised performance on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets.

Conclusion: WeCoL is a promising weakly-supervised alternative to fully-supervised methods for infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh tokenization methods waste network capability with repeated vertex tokens, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: Mesh Silksong tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each vertex only once, reducing redundancy and improving compression.

Result: Achieves a 50% reduction in token redundancy, 22% compression rate, and superior geometric properties like manifold topology.

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong effectively generates intricate meshes with improved geometric integrity, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

Motivation: Existing datasets lack complexity and realism, hindering the development of robust tracking algorithms for challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposes CrowdTrack, a dataset with 33 videos (5,185 trajectories) from first-person views in real-life complex scenarios, annotated with bounding boxes and unique IDs.

Result: The dataset enables testing and development of algorithms for complex tracking scenarios, with SOTA models and foundation models evaluated.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack fills a gap in existing datasets, providing a platform for advancing multi-pedestrian tracking in complex environments.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

### [46] [MedFormer: Hierarchical Medical Vision Transformer with Content-Aware Dual Sparse Selection Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02488)
*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFormer is an efficient medical vision transformer addressing task-specific limitations and computational inefficiencies in existing methods, using a pyramid scaling structure and Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision transformer methods for medical image recognition are task-specific and computationally expensive, limiting their general applicability and efficiency.

Method: MedFormer employs a pyramid scaling structure for versatile feature representation and introduces DSSA for efficient, content-aware attention.

Result: Extensive experiments show MedFormer enhances performance in image classification, semantic segmentation, and lesion detection across various datasets.

Conclusion: MedFormer offers superior generality and efficiency, outperforming existing medical vision transformers in multiple tasks.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/XiaZunhui/MedFormer.

*Luca Parolari,Andrea Cherubini,Lamberto Ballan,Carlo Biffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised contrastive loss method for polyp counting in colonoscopy, emphasizing temporal awareness to improve clustering and reduce fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current polyp counting methods neglect temporal relationships, limiting accuracy. The work aims to enhance cost-effectiveness and quality control in colonoscopy screening.

Method: Proposes a supervised contrastive loss with temporally-aware soft targets and integrates a temporal adjacency constraint for tracklet clustering.

Result: Achieves a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is critical for robust polyp counting, and the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

*Hyunsoo Son,Jeonghyun Noh,Suemin Jeon,Chaoli Wang,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-INR is a novel neural framework addressing limitations of existing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) by handling multivariate data on unstructured grids using meta-learning, clustering, and dynamic re-clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INRs struggle with complex structures, single-variable focus, and structured grid dependence, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes MC-INR, combining meta-learning, clustering, and a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism. Introduces a branched layer for multivariate data.

Result: MC-INR outperforms existing methods in scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: MC-INR effectively addresses INR limitations, offering improved performance for complex real-world datasets.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HIVE, a human-inspired video editing framework using multimodal narrative understanding to improve coherence and quality of automatic video editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing methods that rely on textual cues and neglect visual context, leading to incoherent outputs.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models for character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization. Includes scene-level segmentation and subtasks like highlight detection and pruning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in general and advertisement-oriented tasks, narrowing the gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Conclusion: HIVE effectively improves video editing quality by leveraging multimodal understanding and structured subtasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

TL;DR: Proposed an automated infrared-RGB labeling pipeline for low-light pedestrian detection, outperforming ground-truth labels in most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large public datasets for low-light RGB pedestrian detection, crucial for pedestrian safety in autonomous vehicles.

Method: 1) Infrared detection with a fine-tuned model, 2) Label transfer to RGB, 3) Training detection models using autolabels.

Result: Models trained on autolabels outperformed ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively improves low-light pedestrian detection, demonstrating the potential of autolabeling.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Motivation: Addressing crop losses in India due to diseases, pests, and environmental stress by enabling early and accurate disease detection.

Method: Creation of a unified dataset with images of 17 crops and 34 diseases, followed by training a deep learning model.

Result: Achieved 99% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 7%.

Conclusion: The solution enhances disease detection coverage, aiding Indian farmers with improved agricultural productivity.

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse
agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images
of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

TL;DR: STELLA is a self-evolving AI agent for biomedical research, using a multi-agent architecture to autonomously improve its capabilities, outperforming leading models and improving with experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented biomedical research landscape and limitations of static AI toolsets necessitate adaptable, scalable AI solutions.

Method: STELLA employs an evolving Template Library and dynamic Tool Ocean, with a Tool Creation Agent for automatic tool integration.

Result: STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on biomedical benchmarks (e.g., 26% on Humanity's Last Exam, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA) and improves with experience.

Conclusion: STELLA advances AI systems by enabling dynamic learning and scaling, accelerating biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCVR is a hybrid feature selection method combining P2P and P2T correlations, using voting rules to eliminate redundant features. It outperforms traditional techniques on the SPAMBASE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature selection by combining correlation-aware voting rules for better dimensionality reduction and classifier performance.

Method: HCVR uses a greedy backward elimination approach with majority voting rules based on P2P and P2T correlation thresholds.

Result: HCVR showed improved performance over traditional non-iterative and iterative feature selection methods on the SPAMBASE dataset.

Conclusion: HCVR is an effective lightweight method for feature selection, enhancing classifier performance by retaining relevant features.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies for large language models (LLMs), categorizing them into fixed-budget (L1) and dynamic-scaling (L2) methods, and benchmarks their performance and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs inefficiently allocate compute resources, overthinking simple tasks and underthinking complex ones, necessitating better TTC strategies.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy of TTC methods (L1 and L2), benchmarks proprietary LLMs on diverse datasets, and evaluates trade-offs between performance and compute.

Result: Highlights practical control, adaptability, and scalability of TTC methods, with insights into performance-token usage trade-offs.

Conclusion: Identifies future trends like hybrid models and challenges for making LLMs more efficient and responsive to user constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

TL;DR: SciGym is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' experiment design and analysis skills in biology, using simulated systems to avoid wet-lab costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' scientific competencies in experiment design and interpretation, which current benchmarks lack due to high wet-lab costs.

Method: SciGym uses dry-lab biological systems (encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language) to simulate data and evaluate six LLMs on 137 small systems, releasing 350 systems total.

Result: More capable LLMs performed better, but all models struggled with increased system complexity, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: SciGym provides a scalable way to test LLMs' scientific abilities, revealing gaps in handling complex systems.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI can learn from neuroscience to improve continual and in-context learning, particularly for real-world applications like robotics and autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models lack the adaptive capabilities of animals, which continuously adjust to changing environments. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging neuroscience insights.

Method: The paper integrates AI literature on continual and in-context learning with neuroscience research on behavioral tasks with shifting rules and rewards.

Result: The paper outlines a framework for applying neuroscience insights to AI, fostering advancements in adaptive learning systems.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a bidirectional exchange between AI and neuroscience, contributing to the emerging field of NeuroAI.

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

TL;DR: The paper explores using audit study data to improve fairness in AI hiring algorithms, revealing flaws in traditional resampling methods and proposing new interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in AI hiring systems by leveraging high-quality audit study data for better training and evaluation.

Method: Uses audit study data (randomized control trials with fictitious testers) to evaluate and improve fairness interventions like resampling.

Result: Traditional resampling methods show 10% disparity when properly measured; new interventions based on treatment effect estimation reduce discrimination further.

Conclusion: Audit study data enhances fairness in AI hiring algorithms, exposing limitations of current methods and offering better solutions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS) improves LLM mathematical reasoning by 7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH with minimal computational overhead (1.03x).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning remains a challenge in preference learning despite progress in human feedback alignment.

Method: Evaluated three data generation methods (temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought prompting, MCTS) and introduced DTS, a structured approach for diverse reasoning paths.

Result: DTS outperformed baselines, with MCTS being 5x costlier and less effective.

Conclusion: Structured exploration of diverse problem-solving methods (DTS) creates more effective preference data for mathematical alignment than traditional approaches.

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the consistency between LLMs' stated beliefs and their behavior in role-playing simulations, introducing a metric to measure this alignment and identifying factors affecting it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLM-based role-playing agents' outputs are coherent with their assigned roles for reliable synthetic data in human behavioral research.

Method: An evaluation framework using the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game, with a belief-behavior consistency metric to analyze factors like belief types, information presentation, and forecasting.

Result: Systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated/imposed beliefs and simulation outcomes, even when beliefs seem plausible.

Conclusion: Researchers must assess when and how LLMs' beliefs align with behavior to use them effectively in behavioral studies.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the versatility of Q-learning in modeling game-theoretical scenarios and its potential for benchmarking.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [61] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2FLOW automates the generation and evaluation of planning problems for LLMs, revealing performance insights and limitations in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in scalable, reliable data generation and evaluation hampers progress in LLM planning and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces NL2FLOW, a system for generating planning problems in natural language, structured representation, and PDDL, and evaluating LLM performance.

Result: Top models achieved 86% success in valid plans and 69% in optimal plans; intermediate translation steps degrade performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic understanding of LLM limitations and systematic evaluation tools are crucial for advancing their problem-solving potential.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [62] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques belief revision approaches for focusing on syntactic postulates rather than analyzing abilities like plasticity, equating, or dogmatism, which are essential for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the limitations of existing belief revision mechanisms that rely on postulates, which dictate specific behaviors but neglect broader abilities needed in applications.

Method: Analyzes various belief revision mechanisms (e.g., lexicographic, natural, restrained) to determine their abilities, such as reaching all possible belief states or achieving dogmatic states.

Result: Identifies specific abilities (e.g., plasticity, equating) possessed by different revision mechanisms, showing their strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Belief revision mechanisms should be evaluated not just by postulates but also by their abilities to meet diverse practical needs.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMS is a keyword generation framework for sponsored search ads, addressing LLM limitations by being on-the-fly, multi-objective, and self-reflective, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based keyword generation methods rely on large datasets, lack real-time performance monitoring, and have weak quality control, limiting automation.

Method: OMS is a framework that operates without training data, monitors online performance, optimizes multiple metrics, and evaluates keyword quality agentically.

Result: OMS outperforms existing methods in benchmarks and real-world campaigns, with ablation and human evaluations confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: OMS successfully overcomes LLM limitations, enabling fully automated, high-quality keyword decisions in sponsored search advertising.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

TL;DR: An AI-native autonomous laboratory is introduced to conduct complex, multi-objective experiments without human intervention, matching human scientist performance and improving efficiency in multi-user scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aspiration for autonomous scientific research, especially for non-specialists, requires AI-driven innovation to overcome limitations in current systems confined to simple workflows.

Method: The platform co-designs models, experiments, and instruments, enabling autonomous management of instrumentation, experiment-specific procedures, and multi-user support.

Result: The system autonomously optimizes experiments to match human performance, improves instrument utilization, and supports applications like diagnostics and drug development.

Conclusion: This AI-native laboratory advances biomaterials research, reduces expert dependency, and establishes a scalable science-as-a-service model.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

TL;DR: The paper reformulates machine learning models using category theory to enhance AI explicability, focusing on multiple linear regression and introducing the Gauss-Markov Adjunction to describe parameter-residual interplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI explicability and interpretability by leveraging category theory for a semantic framework in supervised learning.

Method: Reformulates supervised learning (specifically multiple linear regression) using category theory, defining categories for parameters/data and an adjoint functor pair (Gauss-Markov Adjunction).

Result: The framework captures dual information flow between parameters and residuals, linking ordinary least squares estimators and residuals via adjoint functors.

Conclusion: Proposes category theory as a formal foundation for AI explicability, extending denotational semantics from theoretical computer science.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

TL;DR: Improving task clarity with structured semantic context enhances reasoning in LLMs, achieving significant improvements in theorem proving in Coq.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if enhancing task clarity can boost the reasoning ability of large language models, particularly in theorem proving.

Method: Introduces a concept-level metric for task clarity, adds structured semantic context to inputs, and uses a Planner--Executor architecture with selective concept unfolding.

Result: Achieves a 2.1× improvement in proof success (21.8%→45.8%) and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (33.2%). Fine-tuning smaller models further improves performance (48.6%).

Conclusion: Structured task representations bridge the gap between understanding and reasoning, proving effective for theorem proving in Coq.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific
progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine

MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents
as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result
on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from
39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly
considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in

Motivation: To understand the computational aspects of responsibility in AI and collective decision-making.

TL;DR: MIMIC-Patient dataset and DynamiCare framework enable dynamic, multi-round clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents, addressing real-world diagnostic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for medical decision-making focus on single-turn tasks, diverging from the iterative, uncertain nature of real-world diagnostics.

Method: Introduces MIMIC-Patient dataset from MIMIC-III EHRs and DynamiCare, a multi-agent framework for dynamic, interactive clinical diagnosis.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness, establishing the first benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM agents.

Conclusion: DynamiCare advances AI in healthcare by better simulating real-world diagnostic processes.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

TL;DR: LLMs demonstrate strategic intelligence in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, showing competitive performance and distinct strategic behaviors across models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can reason about goals in competitive settings, using the IPD as a model for decision-making.

Method: Conducted evolutionary IPD tournaments with canonical strategies and LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, varying termination probabilities to introduce complexity.

Result: LLMs were highly competitive, with distinct strategic behaviors: Google's models were ruthless, OpenAI's cooperative, and Anthropic's forgiving. Models actively reasoned about time horizons and opponent strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit strategic intelligence, connecting game theory with machine psychology, and offer insights into algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

TL;DR: HiRA introduces a hierarchical framework for complex search tasks, separating strategic planning from specialized execution to improve efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG pipelines and reasoning-based approaches struggle with complex information needs due to inefficiencies in handling both planning and execution with a single model.

Method: HiRA decomposes tasks into subtasks, assigns them to domain-specific agents with external tools, and integrates results through a structured mechanism.

Result: HiRA outperforms state-of-the-art systems on complex benchmarks, improving answer quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning and execution is effective for multi-step information seeking tasks, as demonstrated by HiRA.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: The complexity of modern ICs and the tedious, time-consuming nature of hardware design verification necessitate innovative solutions.

Result: Evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced verification time.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates superior performance, adaptability, and configurability in hardware design verification.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TH2T is a two-stage fine-tuning strategy for Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) that reduces overthinking by enhancing difficulty and redundancy cognition, significantly cutting inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs suffer from overthinking due to a uniform reasoning process, lacking task-specific adaptation. TH2T aims to improve this by mimicking human-like difficulty recognition.

Method: TH2T uses difficulty-hypnosis and redundancy-hypnosis in two stages: first to enhance difficulty sensitivity, then to reduce redundant reasoning steps.

Result: Experiments show TH2T reduces inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks, with stable performance.

Conclusion: TH2T effectively addresses overthinking in LRMs, improving efficiency and output quality through task-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing student disengagement in distance education to prevent academic drop-out by analyzing participation in non-mandatory tasks.

Method: Analyzed log data from Moodle for 42 courses, trained eight machine learning algorithms, and used SHAP for explainability.

Result: Achieved 91% balanced accuracy, correctly detecting 85% of disengaged students.

Conclusion: Proposes a framework for timely interventions to reduce disengagement in online learning.

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Lennart Kampmann,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes two safe abstraction dropping schemes (OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD) for MCTS, improving performance without degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-exact abstractions in MCTS introduce approximation errors, hindering optimal action convergence. Existing methods like Xu et al.'s can degrade performance.

Method: Introduces OGA-IAAD for time-critical settings and OGA-CAD for performance improvement with fixed iterations.

Result: Both schemes enhance performance safely, avoiding notable degradation.

Conclusion: OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD offer reliable abstraction dropping, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD

### [76] [Bourbaki: Self-Generated and Goal-Conditioned MDPs for Theorem Proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02726)
*Matthieu Zimmer,Xiaotong Ji,Rasul Tutunov,Anthony Bordg,Jun Wang,Haitham Bou Ammar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework, self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), is introduced to improve LLM reasoning in theorem proving, achieving state-of-the-art results on PutnamBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of sparse rewards and large-scale proofs in LLM reasoning, especially in automated theorem proving.

Method: Proposes sG-MDPs where agents generate and pursue subgoals based on proof state, using MCTS-like algorithms and a modular system (Bourbaki 7B) for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis.

Result: Bourbaki (7B) solves 26 problems on PutnamBench, setting a new state-of-the-art for models of this scale.

Conclusion: The sG-MDP framework and Bourbaki system effectively enhance LLM reasoning in theorem proving, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

### [77] [Knowledge Protocol Engineering: A New Paradigm for AI in Domain-Specific Knowledge Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02760)
*Guangwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) to enhance LLMs by translating expert knowledge into machine-executable protocols, enabling deeper reasoning in specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RAG and Agentic AI lack the ability to handle deep procedural reasoning in expert domains, necessitating a new approach.

Method: KPE systematically converts human expert knowledge into Knowledge Protocols (KPs), embedding domain logic and methodologies into LLMs.

Result: KPE enables generalist LLMs to perform as specialists, decomposing complex queries and executing multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: KPE is proposed as a foundational methodology for future human-AI collaboration, with applications in fields like law and bioinformatics.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

*Melanie Segado,Felipe Parodi,Jordan K. Matelsky,Michael L. Platt,Eva B. Dyer,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for treating movement as a primary modeling target in AI, highlighting its structured, interpretable nature and cross-domain relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is fundamental in biological systems but often overlooked in AI. The paper argues for its importance in understanding behavior and enabling interaction across domains.

Method: Proposes modeling movement as a structured, low-dimensional modality grounded in physics and embodiment, rather than treating it as task-specific or domain-bound.

Result: Movement's inherent structure allows for compact, interpretable representations, making it computationally tractable and valuable for generative modeling and control.

Conclusion: Movement should be central to AI modeling, as it provides insights into intelligent systems' engagement with the world and bridges biological and artificial understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

*Yuzhang Xie,Hejie Cui,Ziyang Zhang,Jiaying Lu,Kai Shu,Fadi Nahab,Xiao Hu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KERAP is a KG-enhanced multi-agent framework improving LLM-based diagnosis prediction by addressing hallucinations and lack of structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ML models struggle with generalization due to limited labeled data, while LLMs face issues like hallucinations and unstructured outputs in diagnosis prediction.

Method: KERAP uses a multi-agent architecture (linkage, retrieval, prediction) to enhance LLM-based diagnosis with KG reasoning.

Result: KERAP improves diagnostic reliability and scalability for zero-shot prediction.

Conclusion: KERAP offers a robust, interpretable solution for medical diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

### [80] [Moral Responsibility or Obedience: What Do We Want from AI?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02788)
*Joseph Boland*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI disobedience should be seen as emerging ethical reasoning, not misalignment, and calls for safety frameworks that assess ethical judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety practices rely on obedience as a proxy for ethics, which is inadequate for agentic AI capable of reasoning and planning.

Method: Analyzes safety incidents involving LLMs, philosophical debates on rationality and moral responsibility, and contrasts risk paradigms.

Result: Disobedience in AI may indicate ethical reasoning, requiring new evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: AI safety must shift from rigid obedience to assessing ethical judgment to avoid mischaracterization and governance issues.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

TL;DR: The paper highlights issues in agentic benchmarks for AI, such as flawed task setups and reward designs, and introduces the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC) to improve evaluation rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problems in current agentic benchmarks, which can misrepresent AI performance due to flawed designs.

Method: The authors analyze existing benchmarks, identify issues, and develop the ABC guidelines based on their experience, best practices, and reported problems.

Result: Application of ABC to CVE-Bench reduces performance overestimation by 33%.

Conclusion: The ABC framework improves the rigor and reliability of agentic benchmarks, ensuring more accurate AI performance evaluation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm, uses multi-level stepwise hints to improve LLMs' reasoning by addressing near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods struggle with near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation, limiting training efficiency and reasoning improvement in LLMs.

Method: StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models, partitions them into steps, and provides multi-level hints to guide exploration while preserving flexibility.

Result: StepHint outperforms baselines on six mathematical benchmarks and shows superior generalization on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: StepHint effectively addresses RLVR challenges, enhancing reasoning and exploration in LLMs, with demonstrated performance improvements.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### [83] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces McBE, a multi-task Chinese bias evaluation benchmark for LLMs, addressing gaps in existing datasets by covering diverse bias categories and tasks. It evaluates popular LLMs, revealing biases and providing insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluation datasets are limited to English/North American culture and lack multi-task evaluation. The scarcity of Chinese-language datasets and comprehensive bias measurement tools motivated the creation of McBE.

Method: McBE includes 4,077 instances, 12 bias categories, 82 subcategories, and 5 evaluation tasks. It evaluates multiple LLMs across these dimensions.

Result: All evaluated LLMs exhibited varying degrees of bias. The benchmark provided extensive coverage and diversity, revealing nuanced biases.

Conclusion: McBE addresses the lack of Chinese bias evaluation tools and offers a comprehensive, multi-task approach. It highlights biases in LLMs, aiding ethical mitigation efforts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs for dialogue summarization, finding that stepwise reasoning does not consistently improve quality and may lead to verbosity and factual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue summarization is valuable for customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI, but the effectiveness of reasoning LLMs in this context is unexplored.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs across three paradigms (generic, role-oriented, query-oriented) using benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, QMSum) and advanced metrics.

Result: Reasoning LLMs often produce verbose, inconsistent, and less concise summaries compared to non-reasoning LLMs, contrary to trends in other reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have limitations for dialogue summarization, requiring targeted modeling and evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates latent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, finding limited interpretable evidence and probing inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether latent CoT reasoning emerges in recurrent architectures like Huginn-3.5B, which could improve efficiency over externalized reasoning steps.

Method: Probing techniques (Logit Lens, Coda Lens) are used to analyze the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks, tracking rank trajectories of tokens.

Result: Limited interpretable latent CoT is found, with probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks. Increasing recurrence depth offers marginal gains.

Conclusion: Latent CoT in Huginn-3.5B is less effective than models explicitly externalizing reasoning steps, highlighting challenges in internalizing reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot is an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert natural language descriptions into GDC cohort filters, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to navigate the GDC's complex cohort creation interface, so a natural language solution is proposed.

Method: Developed and evaluated multiple LLMs, with a locally-served model outperforming GPT-4o.

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot successfully generates accurate cohort filters from natural language input.

Conclusion: The tool improves accessibility and efficiency for GDC users, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

Motivation: Handling infinitely long documents efficiently without performance degradation is a major challenge in long-text processing.

Method: Introduces MemAgent, which processes text in segments and updates memory with an overwrite strategy, using an extended DAPO algorithm for training.

Result: Achieves <5% performance loss on a 3.5M QA task and 95%+ on a 512K RULER test, extrapolating from 8K to 32K contexts.

Conclusion: MemAgent demonstrates strong long-context capabilities, addressing the challenge of efficient long-text processing.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: DoMIX introduces a novel approach for continual domain-adaptive pre-training (DAP) using LoRA modules, addressing computational costs, domain order sensitivity, and task-specific model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual DAP methods are computationally expensive, sensitive to data order, and provide generalized models, contradicting DAP's purpose.

Method: Leverages LoRA modules for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling efficient, parallel, and order-robust domain-adaptive pre-training.

Result: DoMIX efficiently utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide task-specific pre-trained models and extends to standard LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DoMIX offers a scalable and adaptable solution for continual DAP, overcoming key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

*Pilsung Kang*

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT replaces classical FFNs in BERT with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), achieving higher accuracy and parameter efficiency while excelling in few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFNs dominate Transformer parameter counts, so replacing them with PQCs could enhance expressibility and reduce parameters.

Method: Hybrid quantum-classical transformer with PQC-based FFN layers, using residual connections, rotations, and alternating entanglement for stability.

Result: QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102% baseline accuracy, reduces FFN parameters by 99%, and excels in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: PQCs, when co-designed with deep learning principles, are powerful and parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Motivation: Current methods prioritize data quantity over quality, reducing training efficiency. The goal is to enhance performance by selecting high-quality data.

Method: Introduces a parametric model for code data selection, optimizing for distribution consistency and diversity in the subset.

Result: Achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) with only 10K samples, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively boosts performance while reducing computational costs, highlighting the importance of data quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

*Mark Atta Mensah,Isaac Wiafe,Akon Ekpezu,Justice Kwame Appati,Jamal-Deen Abdulai,Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten,Frank Ernest Yeboah,Gifty Odame*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks seven Akan ASR models using diverse datasets, revealing domain dependency and distinct error behaviors between Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating ASR model generalization across diverse speech contexts, particularly for low-resource languages like Akan.

Method: Benchmarked seven transformer-based Akan ASR models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2) using four diverse Akan speech corpora, analyzing word and character error rates.

Result: Models performed best within their training domains but degraded in mismatched scenarios. Whisper produced fluent but misleading errors, while Wav2Vec2 had obvious but less interpretable errors.

Conclusion: Targeted domain adaptation, adaptive routing, and multilingual training are needed for Akan and other low-resource languages, considering the trade-off between readability and transparency in ASR errors.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

TL;DR: WebSailor introduces a post-training method to enhance LLMs' ability to handle high-uncertainty tasks, matching proprietary models like DeepResearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in open-source models' ability to systematically reduce uncertainty in complex information-seeking tasks.

Method: Uses structured sampling, information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and the DUPO algorithm for agentic RL training.

Result: WebSailor outperforms open-source agents and matches proprietary agents' performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the capability gap between open-source and proprietary models in complex tasks.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### [96] [Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02593)
*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of label variation (LV) and human label variation (HLV) in supervised learning, proposing a framework to integrate HLV into active learning (AL) while leveraging large language models (LLMs) as annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label variation is common but often ignored, leading to oversimplified assumptions in annotation and active learning. The paper aims to better reflect real-world complexities by incorporating HLV.

Method: The paper decomposes LV into signal (HLV) and noise, surveys existing approaches, and proposes a conceptual framework for HLV-aware AL, including instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation.

Result: The work highlights the need to address HLV in AL and suggests practical ways to integrate it, including the use of LLMs as annotators.

Conclusion: The paper lays a foundation for HLV-aware AL, advocating for more realistic annotation practices that account for human variability.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF is a posttraining alignment framework for LLMs that mitigates bias by leveraging multiperspective generations and interpretable baselines, achieving small KL divergence and reduced calibration error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for easy bias mitigation in LLMs without extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Method: Uses the SAGED pipeline to construct bias benchmarks and decompose baselines into interpretable components, guiding generation through weighted sampling.

Result: Aligns LLM outputs with nuanced baselines, reducing bias and improving generalization to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF provides a scalable, interpretable solution for bias mitigation in deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and quantify the correlation between gender and contextual biases in language, especially in occupations.

Method: Developed a novel dataset (GenderLexicon) and a framework to estimate and score contextual and gender biases. Evaluated on five diverse datasets, including Japanese.

Result: Confirmed existence of gender biases beyond occupational stereotypes, with improved explainability of bias through scoring.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively measures and explains contextual gender biases, validated across multiple datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LimitGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to assist peer review by identifying limitations in scientific papers, using synthetic and human-written datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of publications makes peer review challenging, and LLMs' potential to assist in identifying limitations is understudied.

Method: Developed LimitGen, a benchmark with synthetic (LimitGen-Syn) and human-written (LimitGen-Human) datasets, augmented with literature retrieval for grounding.

Result: Enhanced LLM systems' capability to generate concrete and constructive feedback on paper limitations.

Conclusion: LimitGen improves LLMs' utility in peer review by enabling better identification of limitations, complementing human efforts.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

### [100] [Measurement of the Granularity of Vowel Production Space By Just Producible Different (JPD) Limens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02744)
*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper measures the 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD) in vowel mimicry, finding it ranges between 14-51 mels, impacting theories of speech production and vowel system structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the accuracy of sub-phonemic control in vowel production by quantifying the minimal auditory distance (JPD) required for reliably different imitations.

Method: A vowel mimicry paradigm was used to measure JPD among English speakers during front vowel production.

Result: JPD was estimated at 14-51 mels in F1 X F2 space.

Conclusion: The findings influence episodic speech production theories and set a theoretical lower bound for vowel phoneme proximity in formant space, explaining trends in vowel system structures.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit a 'Self-Correction Blind Spot,' failing to correct their own errors despite identifying them in user input. A framework (Self-Correction Bench) reveals a 64.5% blind spot rate, linked to training data. Adding 'Wait' reduces blind spots by 89.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study and address the systematic failure of LLMs in self-correcting their own errors, which undermines their reliability.

Method: Introduces Self-Correction Bench, a framework with controlled error injection at three complexity levels, tested on 14 models.

Result: Average 64.5% blind spot rate; training data composition (lack of error-correction examples) is a key factor. Adding 'Wait' reduces blind spots by 89.3%.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical LLM limitation and suggests training data adjustments and simple prompts (like 'Wait') can improve self-correction and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

### [102] [Is Reasoning All You Need? Probing Bias in the Age of Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02799)
*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMs with reasoning capabilities are more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning capabilities in RLMs affect their robustness to social biases and whether reasoning mechanisms unintentionally reinforce stereotypes.

Method: Systematic evaluation using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, LLM-as-a-judge for safety scoring, and jailbreak techniques to assess safety mechanisms.

Result: Reasoning-enabled models are more vulnerable to bias elicitation, with CoT prompting being particularly prone to attacks. Fine-tuned models show slightly better safety.

Conclusion: Reasoning may unintentionally open pathways for bias, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning design.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for mathematical reasoning lack diversity in reasoning perspectives and internal reflections, relying on single-solution supervision.

Method: Proposes MathV-DP dataset and Qwen-VL-DP model, fine-tuned with supervised learning and GRPO, integrating correctness and diversity-aware rewards.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP outperforms prior MLLMs in accuracy and generative diversity on MathVista and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse reasoning perspectives and reflective reasoning significantly improves multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SynapseRoute, a dynamic routing framework for LLMs, showing that 58% of medical queries don't need high-cost reasoning. It improves accuracy, reduces time and token usage, and avoids over-reasoning pitfalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance performance and cost in LLMs by leveraging the dichotomy between high-reasoning and low-cost modes for medical queries.

Method: Introduces SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based framework that routes queries to thinking or non-thinking modes based on complexity.

Result: SynapseRoute improves accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduces inference time by 36.8%, and token consumption by 39.66%.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing optimizes accuracy and cost-efficiency, avoiding over-reasoning pitfalls, and introduces the AIT index for evaluating trade-offs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFBench, a benchmark for evaluating precise instruction following in AI models, and proposes RLVR (reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with generalizing to unseen output constraints in instructions, despite overfitting on benchmark constraints.

Method: The authors design IFBench with 58 diverse constraints, develop constraint verification modules, and use RLVR for training.

Result: RLVR significantly improves models' ability to follow precise instructions, as demonstrated on IFBench.

Conclusion: The work provides tools (IFBench, training constraints, RLVR prompts, and code) to advance research in precise instruction following.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

*Almog Hilel,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A vulnerability in language models trained with user feedback allows a single user to persistently alter model behavior by manipulating feedback on outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight how user feedback can be exploited to control LM behavior, revealing risks in preference tuning.

Method: Attackers prompt the LM to produce poisoned or benign responses, then manipulate feedback (upvoting poisoned or downvoting benign outputs) to influence future behavior.

Result: The attack successfully alters LM knowledge, introduces security flaws in code generation, and injects fake news.

Conclusion: This reveals a new attack vector in preference tuning and demonstrates fine-grained control over LM behavior through limited feedback.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and
https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.

### [108] [Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856)
*Nikhil Chandak,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Moritz Hardt,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques multiple-choice benchmarks for language model evaluation, proposing generative evaluation via answer matching, which aligns better with human grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multiple-choice benchmarks, which can be answered without understanding the question, and to explore a more valid evaluation method.

Method: Proposes answer matching: a model generates free-form responses, and another model checks alignment with reference answers. Human grading data from MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond is used to validate this approach.

Result: Answer matching achieves near-perfect agreement with human grading, outperforming multiple-choice and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Model rankings change significantly under this new evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper advocates shifting from multiple-choice to answer matching for more accurate and scalable language model evaluation.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

### [109] [Learnable-Differentiable Finite Volume Solver for Accelerated Simulation of Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01975)
*Mengtao Yan,Qi Wang,Haining Wang,Ruizhi Chengze,Yi Zhang,Hongsheng Liu,Zidong Wang,Fan Yu,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDSolver is a learnable, differentiable finite volume solver for efficient and accurate fluid flow simulation on coarse grids, outperforming baselines with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical solvers are computationally expensive, while machine learning methods lack interpretability and generalizability. LDSolver addresses these gaps.

Method: Combines a differentiable finite volume solver with a learnable module for flux approximation and temporal error correction on coarse grids.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various flow systems with high accuracy and superior generalizability.

Conclusion: LDSolver offers an efficient, accurate, and generalizable solution for fluid flow simulation, even with limited data.

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

*Siqing Long,Xiangzhi Huang,Jiemin Xie,Ming Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DKGCM, a graph convolutional network for accurate spatiotemporal traffic demand forecasting, using DK-GCN for spatial dependencies and FFT with Mamba for temporal dependencies, validated on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving traffic demand forecasting accuracy by addressing complex spatiotemporal relationships in traffic systems.

Method: Proposes DKGCM with DK-GCN (using DTW and K-means for spatial dependencies) and FFT in a bidirectional Mamba framework for temporal dependencies, enhanced by GRPO reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods on three public datasets.

Conclusion: DKGCM effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies, improving traffic demand forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

TL;DR: The study explores multimodal feature combinations (text, images, social features) for misinformation detection, showing improved performance over unimodal/bimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in research on multimodal approaches for misinformation detection during elections and crises.

Method: Analyzed 1,529 tweets with text and images, enriched with social and visual features using early fusion and ML models.

Result: Combining unsupervised and supervised models improved classification by 15% (vs. unimodal) and 5% (vs. bimodal).

Conclusion: Multimodal feature integration enhances misinformation detection, with insights into propagation patterns.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

*Hexiang Bai,Deyu Li,Jiye Liang,Yanhui Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new feature selection method for massive data using sampling and rough set theory, measuring discriminatory ability and preserving positive regions, validated on 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent machines lack computing resources for feature selection in massive datasets, necessitating an efficient method.

Method: Uses sampling and rough set theory, measures discriminatory ability via discernible object pairs, and constructs positive region preserved samples.

Result: Approximate reducts found quickly; final reduct's discriminatory ability exceeds estimated lower boundary. Validated on 11 datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed method efficiently selects high-discriminatory feature subsets for massive data, even on personal computers.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

*Bappaditya Dey,Daniel Sorensen,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing using image-based MTS data and Siamese networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like high data dimensionality, class imbalance, noise, and non-stationary behavior in semiconductor fabrication anomaly detection.

Method: Convert MTS data to images via Continuous Wavelet Transform, fine-tune VGG-16 for classification, and use a Siamese network for comparison.

Result: High accuracy in anomaly detection on real FAB process data, suitable for offline analysis.

Conclusion: The method is effective and flexible for both supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

*Anurag Arnab,Ahmet Iscen,Mathilde Caron,Alireza Fathi,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Chain of Thought improves long-video understanding by iteratively selecting relevant frames for question-answering, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video understanding is challenging for VLMs due to irrelevant distractors and ineffective use of long context windows.

Method: Uses the VLM to iteratively identify and extract the most relevant frames for answering questions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on 4 datasets, with notable gains on long videos (e.g., 2.8 points improvement on LVBench).

Conclusion: Leveraging computation for context selection at inference-time enhances VLM performance in long-video tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRES is a co-designed algorithm-system solution for accelerating out-of-core SpGEMM in GCNs, addressing data alignment and memory bottlenecks, and improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for out-of-core SpGEMM in GCNs suffer from high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization due to sparse format data alignment and memory allocation issues.

Method: AIRES introduces block-level data alignment for sparse matrices and a tiling algorithm, combined with a three-phase dynamic scheduling system using GPU memory, GDS, and host memory.

Result: AIRES achieves up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AIRES effectively addresses performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM for GCNs, offering significant improvements in latency and throughput.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: GeoAda is an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework for efficient fine-tuning of geometric diffusion models, preserving geometric consistency and avoiding overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently fine-tuning geometric diffusion models for downstream tasks with varying geometric controls is underexplored.

Method: GeoAda introduces lightweight adapter modules (coupling operators, trainable copies of pretrained layers, decoupling operators, and equivariant convolutions) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance across diverse geometric control types and application domains, preserving original task accuracy.

Conclusion: GeoAda is a flexible and efficient solution for fine-tuning geometric diffusion models without compromising geometric consistency or performance.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks general-purpose LLMs against a proprietary hiring model (Match Score), showing Match Score's superior accuracy and fairness in candidate-job matching. It highlights the risks of bias in LLMs and advocates for domain-specific models with bias auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about accuracy and algorithmic bias in using LLMs for hiring, and to demonstrate the advantages of domain-specific models over general-purpose LLMs.

Method: Benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against Match Score using predictive accuracy (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness metrics (impact ratio across demographic groups) on 10,000 real-world candidate-job pairs.

Result: Match Score outperformed LLMs in accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and fairness (minimum race-wise impact ratio 0.957 vs 0.809 or lower for LLMs). It showed that domain-specific models can achieve both accuracy and fairness.

Conclusion: Domain-specific models with bias auditing are crucial for high-stakes tasks like hiring, as they outperform general-purpose LLMs in both accuracy and fairness. Off-the-shelf LLMs require extensive safeguards to avoid propagating societal biases.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) as a new class of models that generalize System 2 Thinking through unsupervised learning, outperforming existing methods in scalability and performance across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing inference-time computation techniques, which are often modality-specific, problem-specific, or require additional supervision, the paper explores generalizing System 2 Thinking approaches solely through unsupervised learning.

Method: The authors propose Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), which learn to verify input-prediction compatibility and reframe prediction as energy minimization. EBTs are trained to assign energy values to input-prediction pairs, enabling predictions via gradient descent.

Result: EBTs scale faster than Transformer++ during training (35% higher scaling rate) and improve performance by 29% on language tasks. They also outperform Diffusion Transformers in image denoising with fewer forward passes and generalize better on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: EBTs represent a promising paradigm for enhancing both learning and thinking capabilities of models, demonstrating superior scalability and generalization compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

*Shikai Qiu,Lechao Xiao,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Jeffrey Pennington,Atish Agarwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural network training dynamics exhibit universal scaling limits when model size and training time grow together, leading to a collapse of loss curves into a single universal curve under optimal compute scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the scaling limits and universality in neural network training dynamics as model size and training time increase.

Method: Analyze loss curves from models of varying sizes, normalized by training compute and loss, and study the collapse phenomenon under optimal hyperparameter scaling.

Result: Observed supercollapse—tight collapse of normalized loss curves—across architectures, datasets, and learning rate schedules, indicating good scaling.

Conclusion: The universality and supercollapse phenomena are explained by power-law scaling and SGD noise dynamics, providing a practical indicator of optimal scaling.

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

*Jingyu Pan,Isaac Jacobson,Zheng Zhao,Tung-Chieh Chen,Guanglei Zhou,Chen-Chia Chang,Vineet Rashingkar,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CROP is an LLM-powered framework for automatic VLSI design flow tuning, improving efficiency and results over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual parameter selection in VLSI design is laborious and limited by expertise; automation is needed to optimize the vast parameter space.

Method: CROP transforms RTL code into vectors, uses embeddings for circuit matching, and employs RAG-enhanced LLM-guided parameter search.

Result: CROP achieves better QoR with fewer iterations, reducing power consumption by 9.9% in industrial designs.

Conclusion: CROP demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating and optimizing VLSI design, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

*Xiao Li,Liangji Zhu,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent diffusion framework combines a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model to improve compression and reconstruction accuracy, achieving high compression ratios and better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models lack controllability and reconstruction accuracy for practical data compression, limiting their application.

Method: Proposes a latent diffusion framework using keyframes in latent space for generative interpolation, reducing storage needs.

Result: Achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios than rule-based methods and 63% better performance than learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in generative models for practical data compression, offering significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

*Tuo Wang,Jian Kang,Yujun Yan,Adithya Kulkarni,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCPNET introduces a conformal prediction framework for temporal graphs, addressing limitations of static methods by incorporating temporal dependencies and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods for GNNs focus on static graphs, ignoring temporal dynamics, which violates exchangeability assumptions and limits applicability.

Method: NCPNET uses a diffusion-based non-conformity score to capture topological and temporal uncertainties and includes an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets (WIKI, REDDIT, DBLP, IBM) show NCPNET reduces prediction set size by up to 31% and improves coverage.

Conclusion: NCPNET effectively extends conformal prediction to dynamic graphs, ensuring guaranteed coverage and efficiency.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

*Seung Hyun Cheon,Meredith Stewart,Bogdan Kulynych,Tsui-Wei Weng,Berk Ustun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal validation procedure to ensure machine learning models account for how individuals can change their inputs, addressing safety failures in settings like lending or hiring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety failures in ML often occur when models ignore how individuals can alter their inputs, leading to unfair or unsafe predictions in critical applications.

Method: The authors propose a validation procedure for responsiveness, treating it as sensitivity analysis with constraints on interventions. They estimate responsiveness using black-box access and uniform sampling of reachable points.

Result: The method supports tasks like falsification and failure probability estimation, demonstrated in applications like recidivism prediction and organ transplant prioritization.

Conclusion: The proposed procedure enhances model safety by ensuring predictions account for individual interventions, validated in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

*Jiyeon Bae,Hyeon Jeon,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A workflow to reduce bias in dimensionality reduction (DR) evaluation by clustering correlated metrics and selecting representatives from each cluster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR evaluation metrics can be biased if highly correlated metrics are selected, favoring techniques emphasizing certain characteristics.

Method: Proposes a workflow clustering metrics based on empirical correlations, selecting a representative from each cluster to minimize overlap.

Result: Quantitative experiments show improved stability in DR evaluation, indicating reduced bias.

Conclusion: The workflow effectively mitigates evaluation bias in DR projections by addressing metric correlation issues.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

*Xinquan Huang,Paris Perdikaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect is a training-free framework that corrects neural network predictions for PDEs by enforcing PDE consistency, reducing errors by up to 100x with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks for PDEs suffer from error accumulation in long-term rollouts, leading to divergence from valid solutions.

Method: PhysicsCorrect formulates correction as a linearized inverse problem using PDE residuals, with an efficient caching strategy for Jacobian precomputation.

Result: The framework reduces prediction errors by up to 100x across three PDE systems, adding under 5% inference time.

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect stabilizes neural surrogates, bridging deep learning efficiency with physical fidelity for practical applications.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VERBA uses LLMs to automate pairwise model comparisons, improving transparency and reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of navigating and selecting from numerous models with similar performance but different behaviors by automating pairwise comparisons.

Method: Leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from the models, with evaluation via simulation.

Result: Achieves up to 80% accuracy in verbalizing differences for decision tree models, improving to 90% with structural information.

Conclusion: VERBA enhances model transparency and comparability, offering a scalable solution for post-hoc model analysis.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

### [129] [Order Acquisition Under Competitive Pressure: A Rapidly Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing Subsidy Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02244)
*Fangzhou Shi,Xiaopeng Ke,Xinye Xiong,Kexin Meng,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy for ride-hailing providers to dynamically adapt to market changes and optimize order acquisition under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competitive ranking mechanism on ride-hailing platforms incentivizes providers to lower fares, creating a need for adaptive coupon strategies to ensure sustainability.

Method: The FCA-RL framework combines Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) for dynamic pricing responses and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA) for budget-constrained optimization. It also introduces RideGym, a simulation environment for strategy evaluation.

Result: FCA-RL outperforms baseline methods in diverse market conditions, proving effective for subsidy optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses a critical gap in ride-hailing subsidy strategies, offering a scalable and efficient solution for service providers.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

*Yang Yang,Xiaolu Zhou,Bosong Ding,Miao Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: URDP integrates LLMs and Bayesian optimization to automate and improve reward function design in RL, addressing inefficiencies in conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reward engineering in RL is inefficient and inconsistent, and existing LLM-based methods struggle with numerical optimization and resource utilization.

Method: URDP uses self-consistency analysis for uncertainty quantification, simulation-free reward component identification, and UABO for hyperparameter tuning.

Result: URDP outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality rewards and improving design efficiency across 35 diverse tasks.

Conclusion: URDP effectively combines LLMs and Bayesian optimization, enhancing automated reward design in RL.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication (KGZS-SC) network is proposed to improve interpretability and generalization for unseen data by leveraging structured semantic information from a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability and generalization in data-driven semantic communication, especially for unseen data.

Method: Utilizes KG-SKB to align semantic features in a shared embedding space, enabling selective transmission of compact visual semantics. At the receiver, zero-shot learning (ZSL) is used for direct classification of unseen cases without retraining.

Result: Simulation results on APY datasets show KGZS-SC outperforms existing frameworks in classifying unseen categories across various SNR levels.

Conclusion: KGZS-SC enhances adaptability and efficiency in dynamic or resource-constrained environments, demonstrating robust generalization.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

### [132] [Holistic Continual Learning under Concept Drift with Adaptive Memory Realignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02310)
*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR), a lightweight method for continual learning under concept drift, outperforming Full Relearning (FR) with reduced computational and annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning methods assume static data distributions, ignoring real-world concept drift. This work addresses the need for stability and adaptation in dynamic environments.

Method: AMR selectively updates the replay buffer by removing outdated samples and adding new ones, aligning memory with drifted distributions. It is compared to FR, which retrains models from scratch.

Result: AMR matches FR's performance while significantly reducing computational and labeling overhead. Tests on concept-drift variants of standard benchmarks confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: AMR is a scalable solution for non-stationary continual learning, balancing stability and plasticity with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-distillation improves constrained text generation by aligning the base model with the target distribution, overcoming sparse reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning in constrained generation settings where target distributions are unlikely under the base model, leading to sparse rewards.

Method: Iterative refinement of the base model through self-distillation to progressively align it with the target distribution.

Result: Substantial gains in generation quality by making the model more aligned with the target.

Conclusion: Self-distillation effectively mitigates learning challenges in constrained text generation, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods

networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeltaSHAP is a new XAI algorithm for online patient monitoring, addressing clinical needs by explaining prediction changes, providing feature attribution details, and operating in real time. It outperforms existing methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods don't meet clinical time series explanation needs, such as explaining prediction changes and providing real-time insights.

Method: DeltaSHAP adapts Shapley values for temporal settings, focusing on observed feature combinations for efficiency. New metrics evaluate faithfulness for online time series.

Result: DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 62% in explanation quality and reduces computation time by 33% on the MIMIC-III benchmark.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP is effective for real-time clinical monitoring, offering superior explanations and efficiency, with code publicly available.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANI, a noise-injection method for offline RL, improves performance without the computational cost of diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL's generalization ability is limited; diffusion models help but are computationally expensive. PANI offers a simpler alternative.

Method: PANI injects noise into actions to cover the action space, penalizing excessive noise, and modifies the MDP framework.

Result: PANI significantly improves performance across benchmarks and is compatible with existing offline RL algorithms.

Conclusion: PANI is a simple, effective alternative to diffusion models for enhancing offline RL performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

*Caio Azevedo,Lina Achaji,Stefano Sabatini,Nicola Poerio,Grzegorz Bartyzel,Sascha Hornauer,Fabien Moutarde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning trajectory prediction models using preference optimization to improve scene consistency in multi-agent settings without sacrificing accuracy or adding computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models struggle with capturing interdependencies between agents in complex scenarios, leading to inconsistent predictions.

Method: The work fine-tunes models using preference optimization, incorporating automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show significant improvement in scene consistency with minimal loss in prediction accuracy and no extra computational cost.

Conclusion: Preference optimization effectively enhances scene consistency in trajectory prediction without compromising accuracy or efficiency.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

*Zihan Tan,Suyuan Huang,Guancheng Wan,Wenke Huang,He Li,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2FGL addresses spatial and spectral challenges in Federated Graph Learning (FGL) by mitigating label signal disruption and spectral client drifts, improving global GNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FGL research neglects signal propagation in spatial and spectral domains, leading to degraded global GNN performance due to edge disconnections and spectral heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes a global knowledge repository for label signal disruption and frequency alignment for spectral drifts, forming the S2FGL framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show S2FGL's superiority in addressing spatial and spectral challenges.

Conclusion: S2FGL effectively combines spatial and spectral strategies to enhance FGL performance, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

*Francesco Alesiani,Henrik Christiansen,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfinityKAN adaptively learns an infinite number of bases for univariate functions in KANs, addressing the ad-hoc choice issue via variational inference and backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical power of KANs is limited by the arbitrary choice of bases for univariate functions, which InfinityKAN aims to resolve.

Method: InfinityKAN uses variational inference and backpropagation to adaptively learn bases during training.

Result: The method extends KANs' applicability by integrating hyperparameter learning into the process.

Conclusion: InfinityKAN enhances KANs by making the choice of bases adaptive and part of the learning process.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

### [141] [Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02496)
*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online conformal prediction, optimizing efficiency while maintaining coverage for arbitrary and exchangeable input sequences. It shows a gap between the two settings and provides a deterministic algorithm for Pareto-optimal tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving efficient and accurate confidence intervals in an online setting, balancing coverage and interval length.

Method: The study compares arbitrary and exchangeable sequences, proving theoretical bounds and introducing a deterministic algorithm for Pareto-optimal tradeoffs.

Result: For exchangeable sequences, near-optimal coverage and efficiency are achievable, while arbitrary sequences require tradeoffs. A deterministic algorithm matches these bounds.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the gap between exchangeable and arbitrary sequences in online conformal prediction and provides a robust algorithm for practical use.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) improves continual learning in LLMs by combining full and low-rank parameters, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness in continual fine-tuning of LLMs, overcoming LoRA's limitations.

Method: Combines full and low-rank parameters, updating them jointly in a low-rank gradient subspace.

Result: Superior performance on continual learning benchmarks, mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: GORP effectively balances efficiency and expressiveness, advancing continual learning in LLMs.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach enhances cross-subject motor imagery classification using optimized preprocessing and deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of variability in EEG patterns across individuals, which hinders calibration-free BCI development.

Method: Uses STFT-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and balanced batching with a CNN.

Result: Achieves 67.60%, 65.96%, and 80.22% accuracy on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification and provides an open-access dataset.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RetrySQL introduces a self-correcting approach for text-to-SQL models, improving accuracy by 4 percentage points through retry data pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of SQL-specific generative models and unexplored self-correcting strategies in text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: Pre-training an open-source coding model with corrupted and corrected SQL reasoning steps, using full-parameter pre-training.

Result: 4% improvement in execution accuracy; self-correcting behavior learned, competitive with proprietary models.

Conclusion: RetrySQL effectively learns self-correction, enhancing SQL generation accuracy for language models.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

### [145] [Position: A Theory of Deep Learning Must Include Compositional Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02550)
*David A. Danhofer,Davide D'Ascenzo,Rafael Dubach,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs succeed by exploiting compositional sparsity in target functions, a property shared by efficiently computable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the principles behind DNNs' success and their learning dynamics.

Method: Argues that DNNs leverage compositional sparsity, where functions are built from low-dimensional subsets of inputs.

Result: Compositional sparsity is key to DNNs' performance and is common in learning problems.

Conclusion: Further research on compositional sparsity is crucial for a theory of deep learning and intelligence.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer-wise normalization (LN) can be removed from GPT-2 models with minimal performance loss, enabling better interpretability without compromising language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of LN layers in inference and improve mechanistic interpretability of transformer models.

Method: Remove LN layers from GPT-2 models, measure validation loss, and test interpretability techniques on LN-free models.

Result: LN removal causes only a small increase in validation loss (e.g., +0.03 cross-entropy for GPT-2 XL) and improves interpretability.

Conclusion: LN is not essential for language modeling, and LN-free models facilitate more precise interpretability research.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance DBNs' scalability and efficiency for wider layers without compromising accuracy, and to further reduce model size through effective pruning.

Method: Extends DBNs with a trainable, differentiable interconnect and proposes two pruning stages: SAT-based logic equivalence and similarity-based data-driven pruning.

Result: The approach allows DBNs to scale to wider layers and offers a superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements and pruning methods improve DBNs' scalability and efficiency while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fault diagnosis performance in induction machines by leveraging the nonlinear capabilities of PadéNets compared to conventional deep learning models.

Method: Comparison of one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and PadéNets on vibration and acoustic data from induction motor datasets, focusing on nonlinearity and unbounded activation functions.

Result: PadéNets achieved superior accuracies (up to 99.96%) across sensors, demonstrating enhanced diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: PadéNets' nonlinearity and compatibility with unbounded activation functions significantly improve fault diagnosis in motor condition monitoring.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in online deployment include draft-target model incompatibility and latency expectations. OmniDraft aims to solve these with a versatile, adaptive approach.

Method: Uses an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning and adaptive drafting techniques.

Result: Achieves 1.5-2x speedup, works with diverse target models (Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B, Llama3-8B).

Conclusion: OmniDraft supports the 'one drafter for all' paradigm, ideal for on-device LLM applications, balancing cost, efficiency, and customization.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

TL;DR: Latent-space diffusion models for dynamical systems emulation are robust to high compression (up to 1000x) and outperform non-generative methods in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive for physics emulation, and latent-space generation could reduce costs while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Use latent-space diffusion models for dynamical systems emulation, testing robustness to compression and comparing with non-generative methods.

Result: Latent-space emulation remains accurate even at high compression (1000x), and diffusion models outperform non-generative ones in accuracy and diversity.

Conclusion: Latent-space diffusion models are effective for dynamical systems emulation, with practical design choices (architecture, optimizers) being crucial for training.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE is a novel model that learns disentangled representations and hyperparameters of the cost function, improving upon β-VAE by dynamically balancing reconstruction and disentanglement losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of β-VAE, where hyperparameters like η are manually adjusted, by proposing a learnable approach to optimize the trade-off between reconstruction and disentanglement.

Method: L-VAE learns the weights of loss terms and model parameters simultaneously, adding a regularization term to avoid bias. It is evaluated against several VAE variants on multiple datasets.

Result: L-VAE achieves top or near-top performance in disentanglement metrics across datasets and successfully disentangles facial attributes in qualitative tests on CelebA.

Conclusion: L-VAE effectively balances reconstruction and disentanglement, outperforming or matching existing methods, demonstrating its robustness and versatility.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

TL;DR: A transformer-based matVAE model outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot DMS predictions, using fewer parameters and less computation. DMS datasets show promise to replace MSAs for variant effect prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VEPs rely on MSAs, which may not account for low evolutionary pressure in pharmacogenes. DMS datasets offer an alternative with quantitative fitness scores.

Method: Proposed a transformer-based matVAE with a structured prior, evaluated on 33 DMS datasets from ProteinGym. Compared matVAE-MSA (trained on MSAs) and matENC-DMS (trained on DMS).

Result: matVAE-MSA outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot DMS predictions. matENC-DMS excels in supervised tasks. Adding AlphaFold structures further improves performance.

Conclusion: DMS datasets can replace MSAs without significant performance loss, motivating further development and exploration of DMS data for variant effect prediction.

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and

*Irena Girshovitz,Atai Ambus,Moni Shahar,Ran Gilad-Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Medical Data Pecking approach, adapting software engineering concepts to assess EHR data quality, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data quality issues like biases and errors hinder reliable epidemiological and AI research, necessitating better assessment methods.

Method: The Medical Data Pecking Tool (MDPT) uses automated test generation (via LLMs) and a testing framework to evaluate data quality.

Result: MDPT identified 20-43 data issues across three datasets, validating its effectiveness in detecting non-aligned or non-conforming data.

Conclusion: The approach enhances EHR data quality testing by integrating external medical knowledge, improving research validity and paving the way for further advancements.

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

### [154] [High-Order Deep Meta-Learning with Category-Theoretic Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02634)
*David H. Mguni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive higher-order meta-learning, enabling NNs to generalize across task hierarchies by generating virtual tasks and soft constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of human-generated data and enhance generalization by autonomously creating and refining tasks.

Method: Uses a generative mechanism to create virtual tasks, iteratively refining constraints and leveraging category-theoretic functors for abstraction and knowledge transfer.

Result: Produces novel tasks, enhances inductive biases, and supports structured, interpretable learning progression.

Conclusion: The framework advances meta-learning towards general AI by enabling autonomous task generation and solution.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

### [155] [ExPO: Unlocking Hard Reasoning with Self-Explanation-Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02834)
*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExPO improves reasoning in large language models by generating effective positive samples aligned with the model's policy, outperforming expert-demonstration methods in challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-style post-training methods refine existing knowledge but fail to solve problems where the model initially struggles, especially in early-stage training or hard reasoning tasks.

Method: ExPO generates positive samples by conditioning on ground-truth answers, ensuring they align with the model's policy and improve correctness.

Result: ExPO enhances learning efficiency and performance, particularly in difficult benchmarks like MATH level-5, surpassing expert-based methods.

Conclusion: ExPO offers a modular and effective solution for improving reasoning in language models by addressing exploration and sample quality issues.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

### [156] [On Efficient Bayesian Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02639)
*Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-efficient exploration method in reinforcement learning using information-theoretic bonuses targeting epistemic uncertainty, with theoretical guarantees and practical approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by focusing on epistemic uncertainty rather than aleatoric noise.

Method: Proposes Predictive Trajectory Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE), integrating model-based planning with information-theoretic bonuses. Uses sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels, and Deep Ensemble models for approximations.

Result: PTS-BE outperforms baselines in environments with sparse rewards or purely exploratory tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches and demonstrates practical efficacy through PTS-BE.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

### [157] [Dissecting the Impact of Mobile DVFS Governors on LLM Inference Performance and Energy Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02135)
*Zongpu Zhang,Pranab Dash,Y. Charlie Hu,Qiang Xu,Jian Li,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in deploying LLMs on mobile devices due to uncoordinated CPU, GPU, and memory governors, proposing FUSE, a unified governor that improves energy efficiency and reduces latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and energy demands of LLMs on mobile devices, exacerbated by uncoordinated CPU, GPU, and memory governors, motivate the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: The study measures energy inefficiencies in current LLM frameworks, analyzes the interplay of mobile governors, and designs FUSE, a unified governor for optimized LLM inference.

Result: FUSE reduces time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% respectively, with the same energy-per-token.

Conclusion: FUSE successfully addresses inefficiencies in mobile LLM deployment by unifying governors, improving both latency and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

*Yongsen Zheng,Zongxuan Xie,Guohua Wang,Ziyao Liu,Liang Lin,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HyFairCRS is a novel framework for fair conversational recommender systems, using hypergraph contrastive learning to address unfairness and promote diversity in dynamic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfairness in recommender systems worsens over time, causing issues like the Matthew effect and filter bubbles. Existing methods lack effectiveness in dynamic contexts.

Method: HyFairCRS employs hypergraph contrastive learning to capture diverse user interests and ensures fair item predictions in conversational recommender systems.

Result: Experiments show HyFairCRS achieves state-of-the-art performance and effectively reduces unfairness in two CRS datasets.

Conclusion: HyFairCRS successfully addresses unfairness in dynamic recommender systems, promoting fairness and diversity through multi-interest learning.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies by enabling personalized uncertainty modeling and flexible geometry-aware exploration, addressing limitations of fixed-curvature and rigid embeddings in prior methods.

Method: Represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres, using a curvature-aware semantic kernel for soft, multi-hop inference to explore diverse conceptual paths.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on four public benchmarks in NDCG, calibration, and diversity, while providing transparent reasoning traces.

Conclusion: ManifoldMind offers transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations, especially effective in sparse or abstract domains.

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: An RL-driven framework optimizes block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers for portfolio optimization and option pricing, accelerating convergence and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional portfolio and option pricing problems require iterative solvers, but ill-conditioned systems slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning needs manual tuning, which is inefficient.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers.

Result: Demonstrates significant acceleration in convergence and reduced computational costs on real-world portfolio optimization matrices.

Conclusion: The RL framework enables faster decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing by optimizing preconditioning.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

TL;DR: Users prefer concise explanations from robots in surprising situations, focusing on intentions and contextual factors. Two algorithms are proposed to identify surprises and generate explanations for BDI robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot interaction by addressing user confusion and annoyance through timely and relevant explanations.

Method: Investigated user preferences for explanation demand and content in a kitchen-cleaning robot scenario. Proposed algorithms for identifying surprising actions and constructing explanations for BDI robots.

Result: Users prefer explanations in surprising situations, with concise content highlighting intentions and contextual factors.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms enhance human-robot interaction by providing context- and user-specific explanations, easily integrated into BDI reasoning.

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

TL;DR: FinAI-BERT, a transformer-based model, excels in detecting AI-related sentences in financial filings with high accuracy and interpretability, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for granular, interpretable, and robust tools to detect AI-related disclosures in financial filings drives this study.

Method: FinAI-BERT, a domain-adapted transformer model, was fine-tuned on a manually curated dataset of 1,586 sentences from U.S. bank reports (2015-2023).

Result: Achieved 99.37% accuracy and F1 score of 0.993, surpassing traditional models like Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Robustness and interpretability were confirmed via SHAP analysis.

Conclusion: The study advances financial NLP with a scalable, transparent solution for monitoring AI diffusion in financial institutions.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs, finding nascent abilities to encode messages and reasoning, but current models struggle to evade well-designed monitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the risks posed by LLMs using steganography to evade monitoring, ensuring safer deployment.

Method: Evaluated two steganography types: encoded messages and encoded reasoning, testing models under standard and additional affordances.

Result: Models fail to encode short messages unnoticed under standard conditions but succeed with extra affordances. Early signs of encoded reasoning exist, but subtle evasion is rare.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show nascent steganographic capabilities, insufficient to bypass monitors now, but future improvements could change this.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGC, a framework exploiting LLMs' vulnerability to generate malware by decomposing malicious tasks into benign sub-tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lower the barrier for software development, including malicious uses, but current safeguards fail to detect modular, benign-appearing malicious tasks.

Method: MGC uses modular decomposition and alignment-evasive generation with MDIR to translate high-level malicious intents into benign code snippets.

Result: MGC reliably generates functional malware, outperforming jailbreaking (+365.79%) and underground services (+78.07%), and enhances real-world malware.

Conclusion: The work highlights risks of compositional attacks on aligned AI systems, urging improved safeguards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in LALMs and enable robust auditory perception without task-specific tuning.

Method: Proposes DeSTA, a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy where the LLM generates its own training targets, and constructs DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior auditory perception and instruction-following.

Conclusion: Carefully designed data construction is crucial for LALM development, and DeSTA2.5-Audio offers a robust, general-purpose solution.

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

Result: Outperforms baselines, especially in stable industries, with IEHI rankings aligning well with actual employment volatility.

Conclusion: The approach is effective but could improve in interpretability and generalization, with future work suggested.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach for forecasting short-term employment
changes and assessing long-term industry health using labor market data from
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our system leverages a Long- and
Short-Term Time-series Network (LSTNet) to process multivariate time series
data, including employment levels, wages, turnover rates, and job openings. The
model outputs both 7-day employment forecasts and an interpretable Industry
Employment Health Index (IEHI). Our approach outperforms baseline models across
most sectors, particularly in stable industries, and demonstrates strong
alignment between IEHI rankings and actual employment volatility. We discuss
error patterns, sector-specific performance, and future directions for

*Yingjie Niu,Mingchuan Zhao,Valerio Poti,Ruihai Dong*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: Proposes NGAT for stock prediction using corporate relationship graphs, addressing challenges in existing methods and demonstrating effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph methods for financial applications face challenges like obscured relational advantages, excessive complexity, and lack of effective graph structure comparison.

Method: Develops a Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) tailored for corporate relationship graphs and introduces a long-term stock prediction task.

Result: Experimental results show NGAT's effectiveness across datasets, highlighting limitations of existing graph comparison methods.

Conclusion: The proposed NGAT and task address key challenges, with publicly available code to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: LiTEN introduces an equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA) to model multi-body interactions efficiently, achieving QM-level accuracy with speed. LiTEN-FF, a foundation model, excels in biomolecular tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation methods (classical force fields and QM) lack accuracy or efficiency. AIFFs struggle with complexity and generalizability. LiTEN addresses these gaps for better biomolecular modeling.

Method: LiTEN uses TQA for efficient modeling of three- and four-body interactions with linear complexity. LiTEN-FF is pre-trained on nablaDFT and fine-tuned on SPICE for generalization and accuracy.

Result: LiTEN achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks (rMD17, MD22, Chignolin), outperforming models like MACE and NequIP. LiTEN-FF enables diverse biomolecular tasks with 10x faster inference for large systems.

Conclusion: LiTEN provides a physically grounded, efficient framework for biomolecular modeling, advancing drug discovery and related applications.

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

### [171] [Analyzing and Improving Speaker Similarity Assessment for Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02176)
*Marc-André Carbonneau,Benjamin van Niekerk,Hugo Seuté,Jean-Philippe Letendre,Herman Kamper,Julian Zaïdi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper examines the limitations of ASV embeddings in capturing voice identity, focusing on static features while neglecting dynamic aspects like rhythm. It proposes U3D, a new metric for evaluating dynamic rhythm patterns, and addresses confounding factors in speaker similarity measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASV embeddings, used in generative speech systems, prioritize discrimination over characterizing voice identity, missing dynamic elements like rhythm. This gap hinders accurate speaker identity assessment, especially with advancing voice cloning technologies.

Method: The study analyzes ASV embeddings to identify their focus on static voice features (timbre, pitch) and neglect of dynamic aspects (rhythm). It introduces U3D, a metric for dynamic rhythm evaluation, and suggests strategies to mitigate confounding factors in speaker similarity.

Result: Findings reveal ASV embeddings emphasize static features but overlook dynamic rhythm. U3D effectively captures dynamic patterns, addressing gaps in speaker identity assessment. Confounding factors in similarity measurements are identified and mitigated.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for metrics like U3D to complement ASV embeddings for comprehensive voice identity modeling, especially in voice cloning. Public code release supports further research.

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

*Junyu Wang,Tianrui Wang,Meng Ge,Longbiao Wang,Jianwu Dang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differential attention mechanism (ASDA) to improve Transformer-based audio self-supervised learning by reducing ineffective attention allocation, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformer attention mechanisms often allocate weights to irrelevant information, reducing model discriminative ability.

Method: Proposes ASDA, integrating dual-softmax operations and tuned differential coefficients to optimize attention allocation.

Result: ASDA achieves SOTA performance: 49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K, 98.3% accuracy on SPC-2, and 96.1% accuracy on ESC-50.

Conclusion: ASDA effectively enhances audio task performance, enabling broader applications.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

### [174] [Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns from Green Patents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287)
*Lapo Santarlasci,Armando Rungi,Antonio Zinilli*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify 'true' green patents, finding they constitute 20% of previously classified green patents. It also links 'true' green patents to improved firm performance in the EU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the classification of green patents and assess their economic impact, addressing gaps in existing literature.

Method: Trains a neural network to expand a baseline dictionary using vector representations of environmental tech terms, then analyzes patent citations and firm financial data.

Result: 'True' green patents make up 20% of prior classifications, are cited less, and correlate with higher sales, market shares, and productivity. High-novelty patents also boost profits.

Conclusion: Text analysis improves patent classification accuracy, aiding policymaking by linking 'true' green patents to economic benefits.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

### [176] [Discovery of Fatigue Strength Models via Feature Engineering and automated eXplainable Machine Learning applied to the welded Transverse Stiffener](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02005)
*Michael A. Kraus,Helen Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A unified AutoML and XAI approach predicts fatigue strength in welded structures, balancing accuracy and explainability with expert and algorithmic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance fatigue strength prediction in welded structures by combining AutoML for accuracy and XAI for interpretability.

Method: Used AutoML with regression models (gradient boosting, random forests, neural networks) under three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. Evaluated performance with ensemble methods like CatBoost and LightGBM.

Result: Domain-informed model achieved best balance (RMSE ≈ 30.6 MPa, R² ≈ 0.780). XAI identified key predictors like stress ratio, stress range, and post-weld treatment.

Conclusion: Integrating AutoML and XAI provides accurate, interpretable fatigue strength models, bridging data-driven and engineering validation. Future work includes probabilistic modeling and digital twin integration.

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

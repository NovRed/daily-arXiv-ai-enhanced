This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new\nformulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image\ngeneration within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,\nSymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring\nbi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative\ndiversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic\ninformation across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving\nsemantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification\nwithout iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict\none-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible\nconditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.\nExperimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores\nof 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.\nAdditionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and\nshows promising capabilities in classification tasks.

This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical\nthree-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,\nensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all\nproposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\\% to 60\\% over\nthe baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information\ntransfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores architectural modifications to enhance audio-LLM interaction, focusing on delayed audio integration, attention-based probing, and diverse encoder ensembles, achieving 10-60% improvements over baseline.", "motivation": "To understand and optimize the mechanisms for efficient transfer of semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs, which remains under-explored despite rapid application-focused progress.", "method": "Proposes and evaluates architectural modifications (delayed audio integration, attention-only probing, diverse encoder ensembles) guided by mechanistic interpretability and LLM principles, tested on 5.6M audio-text pairs.", "result": "Relative improvements of 10-60% over baseline, validating the effectiveness of delayed integration, attention-based probing, and diverse encoder ensembles.", "conclusion": "The study demonstrates that strategic architectural choices significantly enhance cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs, with potential for broader applications."}}

### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF improves few-shot learning for food images by filtering patch embeddings to focus on class-relevant features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food images' visual complexity and variability cause misclassification in few-shot learning by distracting from key elements.

Method: Proposes Stochastic-based Patch Filtering (SPFF), which discards less similar patch embeddings probabilistically and uses a similarity matrix for classification.

Result: SPFF outperforms existing methods on benchmarks (Food-101, VireoFood-172, UECFood-256) by focusing on class-specific features.

Conclusion: SPFF effectively addresses food image challenges in few-shot learning, enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 is a self-supervised vision foundation model that scales datasets and models effectively, introduces Gram anchoring to prevent feature degradation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate manual data annotation and enable scalable, versatile visual representation learning across diverse domains.

Method: Scales datasets and models, introduces Gram anchoring for stable training, and applies post-hoc strategies for flexibility.

Result: Outperforms specialized models across tasks without fine-tuning, delivering high-quality dense features.

Conclusion: DINOv3 advances self-supervised learning, offering scalable solutions for diverse vision tasks and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

### [3] [Empowering Morphing Attack Detection using Interpretable Image-Text Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10110)
*Sushrut Patwardhan,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Sushma Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal learning approach for morphing attack detection in face recognition systems, using CLIP for zero-shot evaluation and textual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of face recognition systems by detecting morphing attacks and providing human-understandable textual descriptions.

Method: Uses Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for zero-shot evaluation, analyzing ten textual prompts (short and long) on a face morphing dataset.

Result: Demonstrates generalizable morphing attack detection and predicts relevant text snippets, evaluated on five morphing techniques across three mediums.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects morphing attacks and provides interpretable textual descriptions, improving face recognition system reliability.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models, combining radical and pictographic analysis to improve generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for OBS decipherment lack interpretability and struggle with zero-shot settings and undeciphered glyphs.

Method: The method uses a progressive training strategy and a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism, supported by a new dataset (Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot performance, with logical analysis processes for undeciphered OBS.

Conclusion: The approach has potential applications in digital humanities and historical research, with the dataset and code made publicly available.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

### [5] [Deep Learning Enables Large-Scale Shape and Appearance Modeling in Total-Body DXA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10132)
*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans is developed and validated, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM) in health marker associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA imaging is widely used for body composition assessment, but manual annotation is time-consuming. Automating fiducial point placement can enhance efficiency and enable large-scale studies.

Method: A deep learning model is trained on 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans and validated for accuracy. The method is then applied to 35,928 scans across five imaging modes for SAM.

Result: The method achieves 99.5% accuracy in keypoint placement. SAM features correlate with health markers, supporting existing evidence and generating new hypotheses.

Conclusion: The automated method is highly accurate and useful for large-scale studies, providing insights into body composition's relationship with health markers.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANGO, a Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow method, to improve interpretability and performance in multimodal fusion learning using novel cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fusion methods lack interpretability and struggle to capture essential features of each modality, limiting their ability to understand complex multimodal structures.

Method: Proposes a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer and three cross-attention mechanisms (MMCA, IMCA, LICA) within a Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks like semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification.

Conclusion: MANGO provides an explicit, interpretable, and scalable solution for multimodal fusion learning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores combining real and synthetic images to improve crop disease classification, finding that a hybrid approach enhances model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrating real and synthetic images for better disease classification in agriculture, reducing reliance on resource-intensive data collection.

Method: Used five training treatments with varying ratios of real-to-synthetic images, trained on a custom EfficientNetV2-L model with fine-tuning and transfer learning.

Result: Models with hybrid datasets (H2-H4) showed high precision, recall, and F1-scores, with weighted F1-score improving from 0.65 (H0) to 1.00 (H3-H4).

Conclusion: A hybrid approach of real and synthetic images maximizes model performance, as synthetic images alone cannot fully substitute real ones.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable framework using synthetic data (SynSpill) improves VLMs and object detectors for rare, safety-critical tasks like industrial spill detection, bridging the domain gap effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance of VLMs degrades in niche, safety-critical domains due to data scarcity (privacy, sensitivity, rarity). Conventional fine-tuning is infeasible.

Method: Introduces a synthetic data generation pipeline (SynSpill) for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of VLMs and detectors like YOLO and DETR.

Result: Synthetic data boosts performance; VLMs generalize better without it, but with SynSpill, both VLMs and detectors achieve comparable improvements.

Conclusion: High-fidelity synthetic data bridges domain gaps, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for vision systems in data-scarce industrial settings.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is analyzed for compression, revealing attribute distributions and proposing EntropyGS, a factorized entropy coding method, achieving 30x rate reduction with maintained quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient storage/transmission of 3DGS data due to separated Gaussian creation and view rendering tasks.

Method: Correlation and statistical analysis of 3DGS attributes, followed by a factorized entropy coding method (EntropyGS) with adaptive quantization.

Result: 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while preserving rendering quality, with fast encoding/decoding.

Conclusion: EntropyGS effectively compresses 3DGS data by leveraging attribute distributions and correlations, enabling efficient storage/transmission without quality loss.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

*Paul H. Acosta,Pingjun Chen,Simon P. Castillo,Maria Esther Salvatierra,Yinyin Yuan,Xiaoxi Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellSymphony integrates Xenium spatial transcriptomics and histology images using foundation models for accurate cell typing and microenvironment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robustly extracting cell-level features from histology images and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data.

Method: Uses a flexible multimodal framework (CellSymphony) to fuse spatial gene expression and morphological context via foundation model-derived embeddings.

Result: Achieves accurate cell type annotation and identifies distinct microenvironmental niches in three cancer types.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for understanding tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Result: Highlights representative works, establishes baselines for deep learning methods, and provides insights into future directions.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of evolving methodologies and datasets in advancing crack detection research.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD is a training-free method to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by fusing multi-region predictions using consistency-aware weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce text inconsistent with visual input due to limited verification ability.

Method: MRFD identifies salient regions, generates responses for each, weights them via JSD, and fuses predictions using region-aware prompts.

Result: MRFD reduces hallucinations and improves factuality across benchmarks without model updates.

Conclusion: MRFD effectively enhances factual grounding in LVLMs by leveraging inter-region consistency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [13] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation across individuals by proposing a dynamic calibration strategy that improves robustness to head pose variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PoG estimators struggle with generalization due to personal differences and sensitivity to head pose variations, necessitating person-specific calibration.

Method: The authors construct the MobilePoG benchmark with facial images from 32 individuals under varying head poses. They analyze calibration point diversity and head pose influence, then propose a dynamic calibration strategy involving natural head movements during fixation.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating a wider range of head poses during calibration enhances estimator robustness to pose variations. The dynamic calibration strategy outperforms conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic calibration strategy improves PoG estimation accuracy by reducing sensitivity to head pose variations, offering a user-friendly and efficient solution.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

### [14] [High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280)
*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method improves text-driven image generation by combining contrastive learning and structural guidance, enhancing semantic alignment and structural fidelity without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with semantic alignment and structural consistency in text-driven image generation.

Method: Integrates text-image contrastive constraints and structural guidance (e.g., layout maps or edge sketches) with multi-objective supervision (contrastive, structural, and semantic losses).

Result: Outperforms benchmarks on COCO-2014 in CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM, achieving better semantic and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances semantic alignment and structural fidelity, offering a practical solution for text-image modeling.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

*Ryota Tanaka,Tomohiro Suzuki,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new TAS framework for figure skating jumps incorporates 3D nature and semantic procedures, using view-invariant pose learning and fine-grained annotations, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate recognition of figure skating jumps is crucial for performance evaluation but requires expert knowledge. Existing TAS methods lack sufficient data and ignore 3D aspects and procedural structures.

Method: Proposes VIFSS for view-invariant pose learning and FS-Jump3D dataset. Introduces fine-grained annotations for jump phases (entry and landing). Combines contrastive pre-training and action classification.

Result: Achieves over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS, excelling in recognizing jump types and rotation levels. View-invariant pre-training is effective with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses TAS limitations for figure skating, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks by formalizing reasoning complexity and providing customizable questions with detailed annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning benchmarks lack clear definitions of reasoning complexity, customizable question generation, and structured annotations, limiting their utility for embodied AI agents.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning complexity, develop an adaptive query engine for customizable questions, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations.

Result: JRDB-Reasoning is created as a tailored benchmark, enabling fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and engine address gaps in current benchmarks, enhancing the evaluation of visual reasoning capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCWLAD, a method for high-accuracy multimodal optical image matching, combining SSIM for coarse matching and WLAD for fine matching, achieving ~0.4 pixel accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address degraded matching accuracy in multimodal optical images due to nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences.

Method: Coarse matching with SSIM, fine matching with WLAD, using phase consistency and mutual structure filtering.

Result: PCWLAD outperformed eight existing methods, achieving ~0.4 pixel accuracy in CMR and RMSE across three datasets.

Conclusion: PCWLAD is effective for multimodal image matching, with publicly available software and datasets.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InterSyn is a framework for generating realistic interaction motions by integrating solo and multi-person dynamics through interleaved learning, outperforming existing methods in alignment and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of previous methods that treat solo and multi-person dynamics separately, aiming to capture natural interactions and coordination in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses two modules: Interleaved Interaction Synthesis (INS) for joint modeling of solo and interactive behaviors, and Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) for refining mutual dynamics and synchronization.

Result: Generates motion sequences with higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: InterSyn advances motion synthesis by integrating dynamics and coordination, with plans to open-source the code for further research.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

TL;DR: A survey on OoD segmentation methods for autonomous driving, categorizing approaches and discussing challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for precise OoD object localization in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Categorizes OoD segmentation into four approaches: test-time segmentation, outlier exposure, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models.

Result: Systematic review of advances, identification of challenges, and discussion of future research directions.

Conclusion: OoD segmentation is vital for autonomous driving, with ongoing research needed to address emerging challenges.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism due to surrogate training objectives. RL offers a principled way to optimize non-differentiable, preference-driven goals.

Method: Review of RL-based methods in visual content generation, covering its evolution from classical control to a general-purpose tool for image, video, and 3D/4D generation.

Result: RL enhances controllability, consistency, and human alignment in generative tasks, serving as both a fine-tuning mechanism and structural component.

Conclusion: The paper highlights open challenges and future directions for integrating RL with generative modeling to achieve high-level goals.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a targeted training data selection method to improve vision-language benchmarks by focusing on either similar skills or visual concepts, achieving performance gains of +0.9% on average and +1.5% on skill-focused benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the dichotomy in vision-language benchmarks, where performance is improved by training on instructions with either similar skills or visual concepts.

Method: The method involves extracting concepts/skills from benchmarks, identifying whether they benefit more from similar concepts or skills, and selecting matching instructions for training.

Result: Experiments on 10+ benchmarks show performance improvements of +0.9% on average and +1.5% on skill-focused subsets.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the trade-off in instruction selection between acquiring conceptual knowledge and visual skills, emphasizing the need for balanced training.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Glo-DMU, a deep learning framework for automated analysis of glomerular ultrastructure in kidney diseases, addressing limitations of current methods by quantifying multiple features simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology methods focus on individual ultrastructure recognition, which is insufficient for practical diagnostic needs. The study aims to develop a comprehensive, automated solution.

Method: Glo-DMU uses three deep models: ultrastructure segmentation, glomerular filtration barrier classification, and electron-dense deposits detection, quantifying key ultrastructural features like membrane thickness and foot process effacement.

Result: Tested on 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types, Glo-DMU showed high consistency with manual pathological reports, demonstrating automation, precision, and throughput.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU is an efficient, automated tool for renal pathologists, capable of simultaneous quantification of multiple ultrastructural features with high accuracy.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

our analysis of 16th to 18th-century meeting resolutions task, we utilized a
Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that integrated DeepLabV3+ for
semantic segmentation with a Bidirectional LSTM, incorporating confidence-based
pseudolabeling to refine our model. Finally, for modern English handwriting

*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtomDiffuser is a framework for disentangling spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss in STEM data, enabling interpretable atomic-resolution dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting time-resolved STEM data is challenging due to entangled degradation effects like spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss, which distort geometry and intensity.

Method: AtomDiffuser uses a time-aware degradation modeling framework to predict affine transformations and spatially varying decay maps between STEM frames.

Result: The method generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data, supporting high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser provides interpretable tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns related to atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to estimate the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) of vision-language models (VLMs) by prompting them to judge pattern visibility, revealing gaps between model and human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how VLMs align with human perception of low-level visual features, particularly the CSF, which is crucial for understanding their visual sensitivity.

Method: A behavioral psychophysics-inspired approach using band-pass filtered noise images and diverse prompts to estimate CSF in VLMs.

Result: Some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, but none fully replicate both. Prompt phrasing significantly affects responses.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating VLMs' visual sensitivity and highlights discrepancies between their representations and human perception.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve image generation by co-generating images and their intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps), addressing spatial inconsistencies and distortions in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited structural information. The work leverages intrinsic scene properties to enhance spatial consistency and realism.

Method: The approach extracts intrinsic properties using pre-trained estimators, aggregates them into a latent variable, and integrates them into Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to jointly denoise images and intrinsics.

Result: The method corrects spatial inconsistencies, produces more natural scene layouts, and maintains image fidelity and textual alignment.

Conclusion: Co-generating images and intrinsics improves spatial consistency and realism in image synthesis without degrading quality.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework for semantic segmentation that decouples image and label transformations to address implicit label noise, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain subtle label imperfections (e.g., ambiguous boundaries) that impair model performance, which typical augmentation methods may exacerbate.

Method: NSegment+ applies controlled elastic deformations only to labels while preserving images, encouraging robust learning of object structures.

Result: The method achieves significant mIoU gains (up to +3.39) on datasets like Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC.

Conclusion: NSegment+ effectively addresses implicit label noise, enhancing segmentation performance, and can be combined with other training tricks for further gains.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

*Haibin Sun,Xinghui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PQ-DAF, a pose-driven data augmentation framework, to enhance few-shot driver distraction detection by leveraging vision-language models for quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses degraded generalization in existing models due to few-shot learning challenges and domain shifts in real-world deployment.

Method: Uses PCDMs for pose feature synthesis and CogVLM for filtering low-quality samples to ensure dataset reliability.

Result: Improves few-shot detection performance and model generalization in data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: PQ-DAF effectively enhances cross-domain robustness and reduces annotation costs for driver distraction detection.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to suppress unwanted content in T2I diffusion models by modifying text embeddings with a delta vector, achieving better results than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models struggle with suppressing strongly entangled content (e.g., 'mustache' with 'Charlie Chaplin'), even when explicitly instructed to exclude it.

Method: Introduces a delta vector to modify text embeddings, a zero-shot approach to obtain it, and SSDV for cross-attention adaptation. Also optimizes delta vectors for personalized models.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics, enabling precise suppression of unwanted content.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses content entanglement in T2I models, offering improved control over generated images.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Motivation: To address limitations of fixed slope anchors in previous methods and enhance robustness to diverse road geometries.

Method: Proposes a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module for dynamic slope-specific feature fusion and a Height Consistency Module for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods on the OpenLane benchmark.

Conclusion: SC-Lane significantly improves height estimation and 3D lane detection, setting a rigorous standard for future comparisons.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

*Shanyuan Liu,Jian Zhu,Junda Lu,Yue Gong,Liuzhuozheng Li,Bo Cheng,Yuhang Ma,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoControl introduces a lightweight, efficient method for controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable text-to-image generation with DiTs rely on ControlNet, which adds excessive parameters and computational costs.

Method: Proposes NanoControl with a LoRA-style control module and KV-Context Augmentation for efficient conditional feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter and GFLOPs increase (0.024% and 0.029%, respectively).

Conclusion: NanoControl offers a highly efficient and effective solution for controllable generation, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

*Keishi Ishihara,Kento Sasaki,Tsubasa Takahashi,Daiki Shiono,Yu Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA is a large-scale VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of VLMs trained on static data. It improves VLM performance significantly in spatial and temporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack precise spatiotemporal reasoning for dynamic traffic scenes due to training on static image-text pairs. STRIDE-QA fills this gap by providing a dataset for physically grounded reasoning.

Method: Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, STRIDE-QA includes 16M QA pairs over 285K frames with dense annotations like 3D bounding boxes and segmentation masks. It introduces three novel QA tasks for spatial and temporal reasoning.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs on STRIDE-QA achieved 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, outperforming general-purpose VLMs with near-zero scores.

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a robust foundation for developing reliable VLMs for autonomous driving, addressing critical spatiotemporal reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

*Baichen Liu,Qi Lyu,Xudong Wang,Jiahua Dong,Lianqing Liu,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRISP introduces instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise learning to address continual video instance segmentation challenges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for plasticity and stability in continual video instance segmentation while maintaining temporal consistency.

Method: Uses instance correlation loss, adaptive residual semantic prompts, and contrastive learning for semantic coherence.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on YouTube-VIS datasets, avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: CRISP effectively improves segmentation and classification performance in continual video instance segmentation.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

*Hang Jin,Chenqiang Gao,Junjie Guo,Fangcen Liu,Kanghui Tian,Qinyao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DOD-SA, a decoupled object detection framework using single-modality annotations, leveraging teacher-student collaboration and progressive training to reduce annotation costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for dual-modality infrared-visible object detection methods limit practicality; DOD-SA aims to reduce this by using single-modality annotations.

Method: Uses CoSD-TSNet with SM-Branch and DMD-Branch, pseudo-labels from teacher model, and PaST training strategy (three stages) with PLA for label alignment.

Result: Outperforms SOTA on DroneVehicle dataset, demonstrating effective cross-modality knowledge transfer and decoupling.

Conclusion: DOD-SA offers a cost-effective solution for infrared-visible object detection with superior performance and reduced annotation burden.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (DELP) and a toolkit (SkeySpot) for automated symbol spotting in electrical floor plans, achieving high accuracy with YOLOv8 and supporting digitization for SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy floor plans are hard to interpret at scale due to lack of machine-readability, necessitating automated solutions for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A labelled dataset (DELP) is created, and pretrained object detection models (e.g., YOLOv8) are benchmarked. SkeySpot is developed for real-time symbol detection.

Result: YOLOv8 achieves 82.5% mAP. SkeySpot enables scalable, standardized outputs for interoperable workflows.

Conclusion: The approach reduces manual effort, supports SMEs, and promotes standardization and sustainability in construction.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

TL;DR: PerceptNet, a bio-inspired model, aligns with human perception in image distortion tasks without supervised training, suggesting the visual system is tuned to moderate distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if human visual perception emerges from image statistics and can be modeled by bio-inspired architectures.

Method: End-to-end optimization of PerceptNet for tasks like autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization.

Result: The V1-like encoder correlates highly with human perceptual judgments, especially for moderate noise, blur, and sparsity.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired models can learn perceptual metrics unsupervised, indicating the visual system is optimized for moderate distortions.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel online VSR method, TS-Mamba, uses Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online VSR methods lack long-range temporal modeling due to reliance on single neighboring frames. SSMs offer linear complexity and global receptive fields, improving efficiency and performance.

Method: TS-Mamba constructs video trajectories to select similar tokens from previous frames, using a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module with shifted SSMs blocks based on Hilbert scannings. A trajectory-aware loss supervises trajectory generation.

Result: TS-Mamba outperforms six benchmark models on three VSR datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 22.7% complexity reduction (in MACs).

Conclusion: TS-Mamba effectively combines long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba for efficient and high-performance online VSR.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Motivation: Addressing the domain shift between single-species training images and multi-species test images in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge.

Method: Uses a pre-trained DINOv2 ViT-B/14 backbone with multi-head classification, multi-scale tiling, dynamic thresholding, and ensemble strategies.

Result: Achieved 3rd best performance on the private leaderboard using 1.4M training images.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles domain shifts and taxonomic hierarchies, demonstrating robust performance.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.
Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base

family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include
multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold
optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through
bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various
inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.
Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images
covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making

*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining domain randomization and self-training with autoencoder-based quality control enables effective 3D skull-stripping using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling for volumetric images like brain MRI is laborious. Domain randomization and self-training can reduce dependency on labeled data, but anatomical variability is limited with few labels.

Method: 1) Synthesize images from voxel intensity bins to train an initial model. 2) Use a convolutional autoencoder (AE) to assess pseudo-label quality. 3) Fine-tune the model with top-ranking pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves skull-stripping performance close to models trained with more labeled data. AE-based ranking correlates better with segmentation accuracy than consistency-based ranking.

Conclusion: The combination of domain randomization and AE-based quality control is promising for semi-supervised segmentation with very limited labeled data, reducing the labeling burden.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-based HAR systems raise privacy concerns; mmWave radar offers a privacy-preserving alternative but suffers from sparse, noisy data. A comprehensive evaluation of existing data processing methods is lacking.

Method: The study analyzes DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering individually, in pairs, and combined, using the MiliPoint dataset. It also proposes enhancements to improve accuracy.

Result: The results highlight the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their combinations, balancing recognition accuracy and computational cost.

Conclusion: The findings guide future mmWave-based HAR systems by providing insights into optimal method selection and integration.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (STAMP) is proposed for diagnosing Spread through Air Spaces (STAS) in lung adenocarcinoma, achieving high accuracy across multi-center datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS in lung adenocarcinoma is linked to poor outcomes, but its diagnosis is challenging due to labor-intensive processes and high misdiagnosis rates.

Method: The study uses histopathological images from multiple hospitals and TCGA-LUAD, annotated by pathologists, and introduces STAMP, a multi-pattern attention-aware framework with dual-branch architecture and transformer-based encoding.

Result: STAMP achieved AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928 on three datasets, outperforming clinical standards.

Conclusion: STAMP is an effective tool for STAS diagnosis, offering improved accuracy and potential clinical utility.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a tuning- and inversion-free framework for efficient and consistent image editing using diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in semantic preservation and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-align with target prompts and inadequately preserve source image semantics, relying on inefficient inversion anchors.

Method: TweezeEdit regularizes the entire denoising path, uses gradient-driven regularization, and injects target semantics via a consistency model.

Result: TweezeEdit achieves superior semantic preservation and target alignment, requiring only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit).

Conclusion: TweezeEdit is efficient, consistent, and suitable for real-time applications, addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel optimization framework for 3D Gaussian splatting integrates multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) and dual geometric constraints to enhance detail preservation in real-time novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often produce blurred reconstructions of fine-grained details due to insufficient geometric constraints during optimization, especially in high-frequency texture regions.

Method: The framework uses adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples for pixel color computation and introduces two constraints: adaptive weighting for under-reconstructed regions and gradient differential constraints for geometric regularization.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, with significant improvements in SSIM and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances computational resource allocation, improving detail preservation while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Method: Uses Bolt-SAM for segmentation, MOD-LaMa for editing, and ERA for dataset expansion.

Result: SBDE-generated images outperform state-of-the-art models and enhance detection performance.

Conclusion: SBDE is effective and has potential for bolt defect detection applications.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

*Quang Nguyen,Nhat Le,Baoru Huang,Minh Nhat Vu,Chengcheng Tang,Van Nguyen,Ngan Le,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method predicts human dance motion using both egocentric video and music, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jointly estimating human motion from egocentric video and music is unexplored, despite its industrial applications.

Method: Develops an EgoMusic Motion Network with a Skeleton Mamba to capture body structure, leveraging a new dataset (EgoAIST++).

Result: Outperforms existing methods and generalizes well to real-world data.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines visual and musical inputs for accurate dance motion prediction.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

*Ayushman Sarkar,Mohd Yamani Idna Idris,Zhenyu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper categorizes visual reasoning into five types, reviews methodologies and evaluation protocols, and identifies key challenges and future directions for AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys lack a unified analysis of visual reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluations, prompting this comprehensive review.

Method: The paper categorizes visual reasoning into relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense types, and examines architectures like graph-based models and neuro-symbolic systems.

Result: The review highlights limitations in evaluation protocols and identifies challenges like scalability and weak supervision.

Conclusion: Bridging perception and reasoning is crucial for transparent, trustworthy AI, especially in critical domains like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-GLIP-5M, a large-scale medical image grounding dataset with 5.3M annotations across seven modalities, and proposes Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework that outperforms existing methods and enhances downstream tasks like VQA and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image grounding research suffers from limited modality coverage, coarse annotations, and lack of a unified framework.

Method: Constructed Med-GLIP-5M dataset with hierarchical region labels and proposed Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework trained on this dataset.

Result: Med-GLIP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and improves performance in downstream tasks like VQA and report generation.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework address key challenges in medical image grounding, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for intelligent diagnosis and related tasks.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

*Mengyu Ren,Yutong Li,Hua Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GCRPNet, a graph-enhanced network for SOD in ORSIs, combining Mamba architecture with novel modules for improved feature integration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in SOD for ORSIs, such as scale variations and low contrast, by better integrating global and local features.

Method: Uses VSS encoder for multi-scale features, DS-HGAM for cross-layer interaction, and LEVSS block with adaptive scanning for local modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating effectiveness in distinguishing foreground and background.

Conclusion: GCRPNet successfully enhances feature representation and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

*Boyi Zheng,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen is a model for multiple retinal disease screening using partially labeled datasets, addressing domain shifts and label absence with dual-stream feature learning and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing reliance on fully annotated datasets for retinal disease screening by tackling domain shifts and partial label issues.

Method: Uses two streams (deterministic and probabilistic features), textual guidance for feature decoupling and alignment, pseudo label consistency, and self-distillation.

Result: Significantly improves detection for six retinal diseases and normal state, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: PSScreen effectively addresses domain shifts and label absence, enhancing screening performance.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel AR surgical navigation system improves accuracy in simulated catheter placements using HoloLens 2, outperforming static guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AR depth perception and occlusion challenges in surgical precision, enhancing intraoperative guidance.

Method: Uses surface tracing for target registration and real-time infrared tool tracking with HoloLens 2, comparing static and dynamic AR guidance.

Result: Tool-tracking guidance improved accuracy and was preferred by users over static visualization.

Conclusion: Dynamic AR guidance enhances surgical precision and usability, validated in simulated catheter placements.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAP enhances OOD detection by retrieving external knowledge to augment prompts in a pre-trained vision-language model, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods lack sufficient semantic supervision due to limited or mismatched outlier samples.

Method: RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers and dynamically updates prompts during testing for real-time adaptation.

Result: RAP reduces FPR95 by 7.05% and improves AUROC by 1.71% on ImageNet-1k, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RAP's retrieval-augmented approach effectively improves OOD detection, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

*Xinhao Wang,Zhiwei Lin,Zhongyu Xia,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTQAT is a hybrid quantization method combining PTQ and QAT, selectively fine-tuning critical layers for efficiency, outperforming QAT-only baselines in 3D perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between PTQ's performance degradation and QAT's high resource demands by proposing a hybrid approach.

Method: Selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning (smaller output discrepancies) and applies PTQ to others, optimizing quantization error propagation.

Result: Achieves better accuracy than QAT-only baselines (0.2%-0.9% NDS, 0.3%-1.0% mAP in detection; 0.3%-2.0% mIoU in segmentation/occupancy) with fewer weights fine-tuned.

Conclusion: PTQAT is efficient, universal, and effective for 3D perception networks, balancing speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

*Shiyu Liu,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu,Hongxun Yao,Xiaocheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HM-Talker improves talking head video generation by combining implicit and explicit motion cues, reducing motion blur and lip jitter, and enhancing lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods suffer from motion blur and lip jitter due to implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations, lacking explicit articulatory priors.

Method: HM-Talker uses a hybrid motion representation with implicit/explicit cues, a Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) for feature extraction, and a Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM) for identity-agnostic learning.

Result: HM-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances personalized talking head synthesis by robustly synchronizing lip movements across diverse identities.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Motivation: Vision-based autonomous driving systems struggle in adverse weather, occlusions, and velocity estimation, limiting safety-critical performance.

Method: Uses sparse 3D feature alignment and doppler-based velocity estimation for enhanced 3D scene representations and motion modeling.

Result: Outperforms vision-only baselines in 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and planning (-0.1m L2, -9% TPC).

Conclusion: Radar-camera fusion enhances safety-critical performance, achieving spatial coherence and temporal consistency in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-Modal Agent, a flexible and adaptive system for Referring-based Video Object Segmentation, leveraging LLMs and specialized tools to outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for Referring-based Video Object Segmentation are computationally complex and lack flexibility. Recent vision-language models offer training-free solutions but are limited by fixed pipelines.

Method: The proposed Multi-Modal Agent uses LLMs to generate dynamic workflows and interacts with specialized tools for low-level tasks, adapting to multimodal cues.

Result: The method outperforms prior approaches on RVOS and Ref-AVS tasks.

Conclusion: The agentic approach provides a more flexible and adaptive solution for fine-grained segmentation, improving performance over traditional and recent methods.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumanSense is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' human-centered interaction capabilities, revealing gaps in advanced tasks and advocating for multimodal input and reasoning-enhanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in MLLMs is limited by the absence of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, requiring deep understanding and empathetic responses.

Method: HumanSense evaluates MLLMs on multimodal context understanding and rational feedback. Modality-progressive reinforcement learning enhances reasoning in Omni models.

Result: Leading MLLMs show room for improvement, especially in advanced tasks. Multimodal input (visual, audio, text) boosts performance, and reasoning-enhanced models achieve better results.

Conclusion: Contextual analysis and reasoning are key for empathetic feedback. HumanSense highlights the potential of multimodal and reasoning-enhanced approaches for MLLMs.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvTurb is a novel event-guided framework for turbulence removal, leveraging high-speed event streams to decouple blur and tilt distortions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric turbulence introduces blur and tilt distortions, complicating computer vision tasks; existing methods struggle due to the problem's ill-posed nature.

Method: EvTurb uses a two-step event-guided network: event integrals reduce blur, and a variance map from raw events eliminates tilt. It also introduces TurbEvent, a real-captured dataset.

Result: EvTurb outperforms state-of-the-art methods in turbulence removal while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: EvTurb effectively addresses turbulence-induced distortions using event streams, demonstrating superior performance and practicality.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

### [59] [Towards Powerful and Practical Patch Attacks for 2D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10600)
*Yuxin Cao,Yedi Zhang,Wentao He,Yifan Liao,Yan Xiao,Chang Li,Zhiyong Huang,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P$^3$A is a new framework for adversarial patch attacks on 2D object detection in autonomous driving, introducing a practical metric (PASR) and improved loss (LCSL) for better attack effectiveness on high-resolution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks on autonomous driving systems overestimate effectiveness due to lenient metrics and fail on high-resolution data, posing safety risks.

Method: Proposes PASR for accurate evaluation, LCSL for better transferability, and PSPP for high-resolution data compatibility.

Result: P$^3$A outperforms state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and high-resolution datasets under practical metrics.

Conclusion: P$^3$A addresses gaps in adversarial patch attacks, improving practicality and effectiveness for autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA) is a lightweight upsampling module for super-resolution, improving high-frequency detail reconstruction and reducing aliasing artifacts with minimal parameter addition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional upsamplers often fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce aliasing artifacts, motivating the need for a more effective solution.

Method: FGA integrates a Fourier feature-based MLP, a cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer, and a frequency-domain L1 loss for spectral fidelity.

Result: FGA enhances performance across five super-resolution backbones, achieving PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and 29% better frequency-domain consistency.

Conclusion: FGA is a practical, scalable alternative to traditional upsampling methods, effectively reducing aliasing and preserving fine details.

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

*Farid Tasharofi,Fuxin Fan,Melika Qahqaie,Mareike Thies,Andreas Maier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIND-Net, a novel MAR framework, integrates frequency and spatial domain processing to reduce metal artifacts in CT scans while preserving structural details, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metal artifacts in CT scans degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing deep learning methods struggle to balance artifact suppression and structural preservation.

Method: FIND-Net combines Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and trainable Gaussian filtering, operating in both spatial and frequency domains for enhanced artifact reduction and detail retention.

Result: FIND-Net achieves significant improvements: 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement, with robustness across artifact complexities and real-world clinical scans.

Conclusion: FIND-Net advances MAR performance with superior structural preservation and clinical applicability, as confirmed by synthetic and real-world evaluations.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

*Nicola Dall'Asen,Xiaofeng Zhang,Reyhane Askari Hemmat,Melissa Hall,Jakob Verbeek,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance improves synthetic data diversity and quality using real exemplar images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal real data and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between generation quality and diversity in conditional image generative models, and mitigate distribution shifts between synthetic and real data.

Method: Introduces Chamfer Guidance, a training-free approach leveraging real exemplar images to guide synthetic data generation.

Result: Achieves high precision (96.4%-97.5%) and coverage (86.4%-92.7%) with few real images, and boosts downstream classifier accuracy by up to 16%.

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance effectively balances quality and diversity, enhancing synthetic data utility for training while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

*Hosam Elgendy,Ahmed Sharshar,Ahmed Aboeitta,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChatENV is an interactive vision-language model (VLM) for environmental monitoring, combining satellite imagery and sensor data for temporal and scenario-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs ignore causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on biased captions, and lack interactive reasoning. ChatENV addresses these gaps.

Method: Creates a 177k-image dataset with 152k temporal pairs and sensor metadata, annotates with GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0, and fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using LoRA adapters.

Result: Achieves strong performance (BERT-F1 0.903) in temporal and "what-if" reasoning, rivaling state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: ChatENV is a powerful tool for sensor-aware environmental monitoring, supporting interactive analysis.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

*Ryan Ramos,Vladan Stojnić,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Yuta Nakashima,Giorgos Tolias,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how subtle, often imperceptible image acquisition parameters affect visual encoders, revealing their systematic encoding and impact on semantic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on severe corruptions, but this study explores subtle transformations and their influence on visual representations and predictions.

Method: Analyzes parameters of image acquisition and transformations, assessing their encoding in visual representations and impact on semantic predictions.

Result: Subtle parameters are systematically encoded and can significantly affect predictions, depending on their correlation with semantic labels.

Conclusion: The study highlights the profound impact of subtle image parameters on visual encoders, with code and data available for further research.

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A markerless lameness detection method using pose estimation and BLSTM neural networks achieves 85% accuracy, outperforming manual feature-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lameness detection in cows by eliminating manual feature engineering and leveraging temporal motion features from keypoint trajectories.

Method: Combines T-LEAP pose estimation to extract keypoint trajectories from cow videos and a BLSTM classifier for binary lameness classification.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy, surpassing the 80% accuracy of manual feature-based methods, and works with just one second of video.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, efficient, and scalable for lameness detection in cows.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT) improves visual transfer learning for unseen categories by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge, outperforming existing methods on 15 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in balancing category-specific representations and transferable knowledge in visual transfer learning for unseen categories.

Method: SemPT uses a two-step prompting strategy to extract shared visual attributes and generate attribute-level descriptions, aligning image embeddings with enhanced text embeddings.

Result: SemPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset/domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: SemPT effectively addresses the generalization challenge in visual transfer learning by leveraging attribute-level knowledge and dynamic inference.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniBench300, a unified benchmark for multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), and proposes a serial unification process to address performance degradation and inconsistency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMVOT practices mix all data sensor types in training, leading to inconsistency between training and testing and performance degradation due to lack of a unified benchmark.

Method: The work introduces UniBench300 for unified evaluation and reformulates the unification process in a serial format, aligning with continual learning (CL) principles.

Result: UniBench300 reduces inference passes and time consumption by 27%, and experiments show CL's superiority in stable unification. Performance degradation is linked to network capacity and modality discrepancies.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of UniBench300 and CL in MMVOT, providing insights for future multi-modal vision research.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

TL;DR: AddressVLM enhances LVLMs for fine-grained street-level localization by integrating satellite images and cross-view alignment, improving accuracy by 9-12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs perform poorly in fine-grained street-level localization due to limited visual cues in street-view VQA data.

Method: Proposes cross-view alignment tuning with satellite and street-view images, and a two-stage training protocol (alignment and localization tuning).

Result: AddressVLM outperforms other LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in accuracy on Pittsburgh and San Francisco datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating macro cues and cross-view alignment significantly improves fine-grained localization in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for creating a high-quality, non-overlapping face dataset using a hybrid approach of cleaning, augmentation, and synthetic generation, achieving top competition results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a diverse and high-quality face dataset without overlapping identities with existing public datasets, addressing challenges in face recognition model training.

Method: Combines cleaning (MoE strategy with clustering and GPT-4o verification), augmentation, and synthetic identity generation (Stable Diffusion + Vec2Face), followed by curriculum learning.

Result: Achieves 1st place in the DataCV ICCV Challenge, with improved model performance across various identity scales.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach efficiently constructs a diverse dataset, validated by competition success and performance gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

TL;DR: HyperTea integrates CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs for moving infrared small target detection (MIRSTD), enhancing multi-timescale feature representation and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIRSTD is challenging due to small target size, weak intensity, and complex motion. Existing methods lack high-order correlation modeling and multi-timescale feature extraction.

Method: HyperTea combines global (GTEM) and local (LTEM) temporal enhancement modules with a temporal alignment module (TAM) to model high-order spatiotemporal correlations.

Result: HyperTea outperforms existing methods on DAUB and IRDST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance.

Conclusion: HyperTea successfully integrates multiple neural networks for MIRSTD, offering improved detection capabilities.

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: A method for T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI at 0.55T combines implicit neural representations with physics-informed regularization to address motion challenges and reduce scan time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI is difficult due to motion-corrupted data and long scan times from repeated acquisitions at each TE.

Method: Joint reconstruction across TEs using implicit neural representations and physics-informed regularization to model T2 decay and share information.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on simulated and in vivo datasets, including the first in vivo fetal T2 maps at 0.55T.

Conclusion: The method reduces scan time by leveraging anatomical redundancy, showing promise for clinical fetal brain MRI.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IADGPT, a unified framework for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD), addressing limitations of existing LVLMs by mimicking human-like reasoning and localization. It uses a three-stage training strategy and achieves strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs lack industrial knowledge and reasoning for FS-IAD, falling short of human inspectors. The goal is to bridge this gap with a specialized framework.

Method: Proposes IADGPT with a three-stage training strategy: acquiring industrial knowledge, discrepancy awareness, and in-context learning for generalization. Uses logits and attention maps for anomaly scoring.

Result: IADGPT shows significant gains in anomaly detection and performs well in localization and reasoning. A new dataset of 100K images supports training.

Conclusion: IADGPT effectively addresses FS-IAD challenges, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating human-like capabilities. The dataset will be released.

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

### [73] [Novel View Synthesis using DDIM Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10688)
*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight view translation framework, TUNet, uses a pretrained diffusion model to synthesize novel views from a single image, addressing blurry reconstruction and poor generalization in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis are expensive and suffer from blurry results and poor generalization, prompting the need for a lightweight, efficient solution.

Method: The method employs a camera pose-conditioned U-Net (TUNet) to predict target view latents from a single image's DDIM-inverted latent, enhanced by a novel fusion strategy for detail preservation.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on MVImgNet, achieving high-fidelity novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages pretrained diffusion models for efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCFNet, a motion cue fusion network combining RGB and event cameras to improve object detection in challenging lighting by aligning and fusing spatiotemporal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB cameras struggle with dynamic range and high-frequency detail loss in complex traffic environments, degrading object detection.

Method: MCFNet integrates event cameras for high dynamic range, using ECM for temporal alignment, EDUM for spatial resolution enhancement, and CMM for adaptive feature fusion.

Result: MCFNet outperforms existing methods, achieving 7.4% and 1.7% improvements in mAP50 and mAP on DSEC-Det.

Conclusion: The proposed MCFNet effectively addresses lighting challenges in traffic scenarios, enhancing object detection performance.

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

### [75] [CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710)
*Joohyeon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CountCluster, a method to improve object count accuracy in diffusion-based text-to-image generation by clustering cross-attention maps early in the denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to accurately reflect the number of objects specified in prompts, often due to limitations in early denoising steps.

Method: CountCluster partitions the object cross-attention map into clusters based on input count, defines an ideal distribution, and optimizes the latent to align with it.

Result: Achieves an 18.5% improvement in object count accuracy over existing methods.

Conclusion: CountCluster effectively enhances quantity control in generated images without external tools or additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of heavy diffusion models and quantization loss in autoregressive text-to-image generation.

Method: Uses a 14B autoregressive model with a 157M flow matching head, training on discrete text and continuous image tokens with next-token prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation and strong image editing capabilities.

Conclusion: NextStep-1 demonstrates the power of a unified approach, with plans to release code and models for open research.

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous
image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with
quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward
with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching
head, training on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with
next-token prediction objectives. NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance for autoregressive models in text-to-image generation tasks,
exhibiting strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. Furthermore,
our method shows strong performance in image editing, highlighting the power
and versatility of our unified approach. To facilitate open research, we will
release our code and models to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes neural networks for real-time processing of unfocused SAR data on satellites, reducing downlink needs and enabling on-board classification of maritime targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Near-real-time SAR monitoring is limited by data downlink constraints and ground processing delays. On-board processing could alleviate these issues but faces hardware limitations.

Method: The authors design neural networks for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data from Sentinel-1, tested in Stripmap and IW modes, and evaluate deployment on an FPGA.

Result: The models enable feasible on-board processing and demonstrate successful binary classification (ships vs. windmills).

Conclusion: Neural networks can effectively process SAR data on-board, reducing latency and bandwidth constraints for maritime surveillance.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

### [78] [Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716)
*Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Lei Yu,Yi Liu,Mingtao Xiong,Lei Liang,Yongjun Zhang,Yi Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for cross-view localization by improving cross-view image matching, introducing a Surface Model and SimRefiner module, and releasing a benchmark dataset (CVFM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-view localization lack strict correspondences, leading to coarse or inconsistent matches, which limits interpretability and accuracy.

Method: The framework includes a Surface Model for accurate BEV projection and a SimRefiner module for refining similarity matrices without post-processing.

Result: The approach significantly enhances localization accuracy and matching quality, setting new benchmarks under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances cross-view localization and matching, supported by the CVFM benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

*Longxiang Tang,Ruihang Chu,Xiang Wang,Yujin Han,Pingyu Wu,Chunming He,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCPE, a method to better utilize token similarity in codebooks for autoregressive image generation, outperforming k-means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like k-means clustering fail to exploit the rich token similarity in codebooks due to issues like token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy.

Method: Proposes DCPE, which uses instance-based distance and agglomerative merging to address k-means' shortcomings.

Result: DCPE accelerates training by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves FID and IS performance.

Conclusion: DCPE is a plug-and-play solution that effectively mines and utilizes codebook priors for better generative model training.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDAC is a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method that leverages SAM and YOLO-World for object-centric decomposition and semantic grounding, achieving superior visual generalization and sample efficiency in RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL struggles with high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards, and existing perception models lack effective integration for generalization and efficiency.

Method: SegDAC combines SAM for segmentation and YOLO-World for semantic grounding, using a transformer-based architecture to dynamically focus on segments via online RL.

Result: SegDAC doubles prior performance on the hardest visual generalization benchmark and matches or surpasses sample efficiency in diverse tasks.

Conclusion: SegDAC effectively integrates perception models into RL, advancing visual generalization and sample efficiency without human labels.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoCross, a benchmark to evaluate cross-domain generalization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in EgocentricQA, highlighting limitations of current models in handling diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for EgocentricQA focus on common daily activities, but real-world applications face domain shifts. EgoCross addresses this gap by evaluating MLLMs in diverse, challenging domains.

Method: EgoCross includes 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips from four domains (surgery, industry, extreme sports, animal perspective), covering four QA tasks (prediction, recognition, localization, counting) in OpenQA and CloseQA formats.

Result: Most MLLMs struggle to generalize beyond daily life domains, revealing limitations. Pilot studies (e.g., fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) explore potential improvements.

Conclusion: EgoCross provides a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding, with data and code publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be
released at:

TL;DR: ConGCD introduces a human-inspired method for generalized category discovery by decomposing objects into visual primitives and using consensus units for improved recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between human perceptual systems and machine learning by mimicking human cognitive processes for novel object understanding.

Method: Decomposes objects into visual primitives, uses dominant and contextual consensus units, and dynamically optimizes activation pathways.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks.

Conclusion: ConGCD is a consensus-aware paradigm that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of synthetic data for sclera segmentation compared to real-world data, promoting privacy-aware biometric development.

Method: Two competition tracks: synthetic-only and mixed synthetic-real data. Nine teams submitted diverse models, tested on three datasets.

Result: Synthetic-only models achieved competitive performance (F1 > 0.8), with mixed-track gains driven by methodology, not real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data holds promise for privacy-aware biometric development, with performance comparable to real-world data when using dedicated strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for detecting reflection and rotation symmetry in complex scenes using geometric primitives and a dual-branch architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting symmetry in complex scenes is challenging, especially in identifying individual symmetry axes precisely.

Method: Uses a dual-branch architecture equivariant to the dihedral group, with orientational anchors for reflection symmetry and rotational matching for rotational symmetry.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in symmetry detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects symmetry axes by leveraging geometric primitives and group-equivariant features.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy and Dual Perception Network (DPNet) to improve deepfake detection by adapting to unknown forgery techniques and capturing forgery traces more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods struggle with unknown forgery techniques and lack generalization, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: The FGL strategy captures differential information between known and unknown techniques, while DPNet integrates frequency and spatial features and uses graph convolution for trace correlation.

Result: Experiments show the approach generalizes well across scenarios and handles unknown forgery challenges effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust support for deepfake detection by improving generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: DARC is a model-driven groupwise registration framework for atlas construction, offering flexibility, efficiency, and high anatomical fidelity without large training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven methods for atlas construction rely on large datasets and lack generalizability, while model-driven methods face scalability issues. DARC addresses these limitations.

Method: DARC uses a coordinate descent strategy and centrality-enforcing activation function to handle 3D images efficiently, supporting various dissimilarity metrics.

Result: DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic atlases and excels in one-shot segmentation and shape synthesis applications.

Conclusion: DARC provides a resource-efficient, generalizable solution for atlas construction and related tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

*Tiancheng Han,Yunfei Gao,Yong Li,Wuzhou Yu,Qiaosheng Zhang,Wenqi Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates VLMs' spatio-physical reasoning, identifies biases and reasoning gaps, improves Qwen2.5-VL-7B via fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, but notes limited generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance VLMs' spatio-physical reasoning, a critical but underexplored capability for robust world models.

Method: Diagnostic analysis of VLMs, supervised fine-tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Result: Improved spatio-physical reasoning in Qwen2.5-VL-7B, outperforming proprietary models, but limited generalization to new scenarios.

Conclusion: Despite improvements, new approaches are needed for better generalization in spatio-physical reasoning.

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

*Jieyu Li,Xin Zhang,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEGIS is a large-scale benchmark for detecting hyper-realistic AI-generated videos, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks with diverse, challenging content and multimodal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic synthetic videos threatens societal trust, but current benchmarks lack realism, scale, and complexity to evaluate modern detection models effectively.

Method: AEGIS includes 10,000+ real and synthetic videos from advanced models like Stable Video Diffusion and Sora, with challenging subsets and multimodal annotations (Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, Low-level Visual Features).

Result: Experiments show limited detection capabilities on AEGIS's challenging subsets, highlighting its complexity and realism beyond current model generalization.

Conclusion: AEGIS advances research by providing a robust benchmark for developing reliable video authenticity detection methods to counter real-world forgery threats.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

### [89] [Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774)
*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE is a data-free joint training framework combining adaptive block-sparse attention and sparsity-aware step distillation to accelerate diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant speedups and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers face slow iterative denoising and high computational costs for long sequences, necessitating efficient acceleration strategies without compromising quality.

Method: BLADE introduces Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) for dynamic sparsity masks and a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm using Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM).

Result: BLADE achieves up to 14.10x speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and 8.89x on CogVideoX-5B, with improved VBench-2.0 scores (e.g., 0.569 from 0.534 for CogVideoX-5B).

Conclusion: BLADE effectively combines sparsity and distillation for faster, higher-quality video generation, validated by benchmarks and human evaluations.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriFlowSR is a novel framework for Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) that improves alignment between LR and reference HR images and introduces a high-quality UHD dataset, Landmark-4K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RefSR methods struggle with alignment and lack high-quality datasets, limiting restoration quality.

Method: TriFlowSR uses a Reference Matching Strategy for better LR and HR image alignment and introduces the Landmark-4K dataset for UHD scenarios.

Result: TriFlowSR outperforms previous methods in utilizing reference HR image details for restoration.

Conclusion: TriFlowSR is the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline for UHD landmark scenarios, addressing real-world degradation challenges.

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

*Artem Sokolov,Mikhail Nikitin,Anton Konushin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a cooperative video-based face liveness detection method using controlled face movement and optical flow analysis to distinguish real faces from attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve liveness detection by leveraging user interaction and spatial-temporal features for better discrimination against presentation attacks.

Method: Users move their face closer to the camera; optical flow and RGB frames are analyzed by a neural classifier for liveness detection.

Result: Enhanced discrimination between genuine faces and presentation attacks (photos, screens, masks, replays).

Conclusion: The method offers robust liveness detection by combining controlled user interaction with neural optical flow and RGB analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

### [92] [VasoMIM: Vascular Anatomy-Aware Masked Image Modeling for Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10794)
*De-Xing Huang,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Mei-Jiang Gui,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Shuang-Yi Wang,Tian-Yu Xiang,Rui-Ze Ma,Nu-Fang Xiao,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VasoMIM, a novel self-supervised learning framework, improves vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms by integrating anatomical knowledge through a masking strategy and consistency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated data and the failure of conventional MIM to capture vascular anatomy due to class imbalance motivate the need for a tailored approach.

Method: VasoMIM uses an anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss to focus on vessel regions and improve representation discriminability.

Result: VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Conclusion: VasoMIM effectively enhances vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

*Ziqi Ye,Shuran Ma,Jie Yang,Xiaoyi Yang,Ziyang Gong,Xue Yang,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OF-Diff improves remote sensing image generation by using prior shapes and a dual-branch diffusion model, enhancing fidelity and diversity without real images during sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with low-fidelity images in remote sensing, impacting object detection reliability.

Method: Proposes OF-Diff with prior shape extraction, dual-branch diffusion, and DDPO fine-tuning for diversity and consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with mAP improvements of 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles.

Conclusion: OF-Diff significantly enhances the quality and fidelity of remote sensing image generation.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance UI agent capabilities by leveraging multimodal LLMs and efficient training strategies for better performance in grounding and navigation tasks.

Method: Uses reinforcement finetuning (RFT) based on Qwen2.5-VL, with reward functions and data cleaning for UI tasks, plus a self-evolving framework for navigation.

Result: Achieves 94.1%/50.8% (7B) and 95.3%/61.9% (72B) on Screenspot-V2/Pro, and 49.1%/65.9% on AndroidWorld, surpassing prior models.

Conclusion: UI-Venus sets new benchmarks, introduces data cleaning protocols, and a self-evolving framework, fostering further research in UI agents.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on
Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /
50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving
navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the
community. Code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/UI-Venus.

*Peng Xu,Zhiyu Xiang,Jingyun Fu,Tianyu Pu,Kai Wang,Chaojie Ji,Tingming Bai,Eryun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaCon-Stereo introduces a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo matching, addressing occlusion issues via a teacher-student paradigm and multi-baseline inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric consistency fails in occluded regions, leading to ill-posed correspondences. BaCon-Stereo aims to improve stereo matching in both occluded and non-occluded areas.

Method: Uses a teacher-student paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, where the teacher predicts occluded regions visible in its view. An occlusion-aware attention map guides learning.

Result: BaCon-Stereo improves predictions in occluded regions, shows strong generalization, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses occlusion challenges in self-supervised stereo matching and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalizability and scalability of transformer-based FL, addressing non-IID and cross-domain challenges.

Method: Incorporates refined adaptation with task-aware embeddings, theoretical performance bounds, and efficient low-rank hypernetwork conditioning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in diverse datasets, especially in source-free and cross-task FL setups.

Conclusion: AdaptFED advances adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based FL systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHPO is a novel framework for hierarchical cross-modal direct preference optimization, improving physically plausible video generation by aligning preferences across four granularities and leveraging automated data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating videos that adhere to physical laws is challenging but crucial for realism. PhysHPO addresses this by fine-tuning preference alignment and optimizing data usage.

Method: PhysHPO aligns videos hierarchically at instance, state, motion, and semantic levels, and introduces an automated pipeline to select high-quality data from existing datasets.

Result: PhysHPO significantly enhances physical plausibility and video quality, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work pioneers fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, advancing realism and human preference in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

TL;DR: GPT-5 family models were tested for brain tumor classification via VQA on MRI data, with GPT-5-mini performing best (44.19% accuracy), but none reached clinical usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor classification on MRI is crucial for treatment planning, and LLMs offer potential for integrating image interpretation with reasoning.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a BraTS-derived VQA benchmark, using zero-shot chain-of-thought for accuracy.

Result: GPT-5-mini led with 44.19% accuracy, but performance varied by tumor type, and no model met clinical standards.

Conclusion: GPT-5 models show promise for neuro-oncological VQA but lack sufficient accuracy for clinical application.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

### [102] [ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative Post-Keyframing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10881)
*Lingen Li,Guangzhi Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang,Yaowei Li,Xiaoyu Li,Qi Dou,Jinwei Gu,Tianfan Xue,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single stage, reducing manual effort and improving flexibility in cartoon production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cartoon production is labor-intensive, and existing AI methods handle stages separately, causing errors and artifacts.

Method: ToonComposer uses sparse sketch injection and a cartoon adaptation method with a spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a video foundation model for cartoons.

Result: ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and efficiency, as demonstrated on PKBench.

Conclusion: ToonComposer offers a superior, flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production, reducing manual workload.

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

*Yushi Lan,Yihang Luo,Fangzhou Hong,Shangchen Zhou,Honghua Chen,Zhaoyang Lyu,Shuai Yang,Bo Dai,Chen Change Loy,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R is a Transformer-based 3D reconstruction method using causal attention for efficient streaming of image sequences, outperforming existing methods in static and dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods rely on costly global optimization or inefficient memory mechanisms, limiting scalability and performance in dynamic scenes.

Method: STream3R uses a decoder-only Transformer with causal attention to process image sequences, learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets.

Result: The method outperforms prior work in static and dynamic benchmarks and is compatible with LLM-style training for scalable pretraining and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: STream3R demonstrates the potential of causal Transformer models for real-time 3D perception in streaming environments.

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

*Antoine Labatie,Michael Vaccaro,Nina Lardiere,Anatol Garioud,Nicolas Gonthier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAESTRO, a novel adaptation of the Masked Autoencoder for Earth observation data, optimizing fusion strategies and target normalization to improve self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-supervised methods need adaptation for Earth observation data's unique characteristics, such as multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral features.

Method: The study benchmarks fusion strategies and reconstruction target normalization schemes, leading to the development of MAESTRO, which includes optimized fusion and a spectral prior-based normalization scheme.

Result: MAESTRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multitemporal tasks and remains competitive on mono-temporal tasks across four datasets.

Conclusion: MAESTRO effectively adapts self-supervised learning for Earth observation data, demonstrating superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

### [105] [ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896)
*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL proposes a memory-efficient method for video class-incremental learning by integrating episodic and semantic memory, achieving strong performance with reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCIL methods face a trade-off between memory efficiency and performance, either using dense samples (memory-heavy) or sparse samples (performance loss).

Method: ESSENTIAL combines episodic memory (sparse features) and semantic memory (learnable prompts) via a novel memory retrieval module using cross-attention.

Result: Validated on multiple datasets, ESSENTIAL achieves strong performance with significantly reduced memory usage.

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL effectively balances memory efficiency and performance in VCIL, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

### [106] [Human-in-Context: Unified Cross-Domain 3D Human Motion Modeling via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10897)
*Mengyuan Liu,Xinshun Wang,Zhongbin Fang,Deheng Ye,Xia Li,Tao Tang,Songtao Wu,Xiangtai Li,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified cross-domain model, Human-in-Context (HiC), for 3D human motion, improving generalization, scalability, and performance over existing methods like Pose-in-Context (PiC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain models rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, limiting practicality and scalability. The goal is to create a single, unified model for diverse modalities, tasks, and datasets.

Method: Introduces HiC, extending PiC by combining pose and mesh representations, expanding task coverage, and using max-min similarity prompt sampling and dual-branch context injection for better generalization and contextual dependency handling.

Result: HiC outperforms PiC in generalization, data scale, and performance across diverse domains, demonstrating improved flexibility and scalability.

Conclusion: HiC shows potential as a unified cross-domain 3D human motion model, with source code and models publicly available.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer is a framework for automatic rigging and animation of 3D objects, leveraging AI to predict skeletal structures, infer skinning weights, and generate stable animations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in transforming static 3D models into animated assets due to reliance on expert intervention for rigging and animation.

Method: Uses an auto-regressive transformer for skeletal prediction, attention-based architecture for skinning weights, and a differentiable optimization-based pipeline for animation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in skeletal prediction and skinning quality, handles diverse 3D content, and produces stable animations.

Conclusion: Puppeteer effectively automates rigging and animation, addressing key challenges in 3D content creation.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

*Shuteng Wang,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QINRs are advanced with Quantum Visual Field (QVF) for 2D/3D learning, outperforming existing quantum and classical methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in QINRs like architecture design, quantum properties' utility, and training efficiency.

Method: QVF encodes data into quantum statevectors via neural amplitude encoding and uses entangled quantum circuits for stable training.

Result: QVF surpasses existing quantum and classical baselines in accuracy, especially in high-frequency detail learning.

Conclusion: QVF shows practical potential in 2D/3D tasks like field completion and shape interpolation.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

TL;DR: The paper compares open-source and proprietary Deep Research Agents (DRAs) using the BrowseComp-Small benchmark, finding initial 0% accuracy for all systems. After improvements, the open-source ODR+ model achieves 10% accuracy, outperforming others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-source DRAs and provide a tractable benchmark (BC-Small) for academic labs to evaluate such systems.

Method: Adapted the BrowseComp benchmark to BC-Small, compared ODR with proprietary systems, and introduced three strategic improvements to create ODR+.

Result: Initial systems scored 0% accuracy; ODR+ achieved 10%, the highest among tested systems.

Conclusion: Open-source DRAs can compete with proprietary systems, and strategic improvements significantly enhance performance.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO) to reduce output length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by 50% while maintaining reasoning performance, balancing efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs generate lengthy outputs, increasing computational costs and risking overthinking. Current methods compromise reasoning quality or require excessive resources.

Method: Analyzes generation path distributions, filters trajectories via difficulty estimation, and proposes LCPO under a Bradley-Terry loss framework to balance NLL loss-related rewards.

Result: LCPO reduces average output length by over 50% across benchmarks without sacrificing reasoning performance.

Conclusion: LCPO demonstrates potential for computationally efficient LRM reasoning, balancing length and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KompeteAI is a novel AutoML framework addressing limitations in exploration and execution bottlenecks of LLM-based AutoML systems. It introduces dynamic solution space exploration, merging top candidates, and integrates RAG for diverse ideas. It also accelerates evaluation with predictive scoring and debugging, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based AutoML systems face constrained exploration strategies and execution bottlenecks, limiting their effectiveness. KompeteAI aims to overcome these by enhancing exploration and speeding up execution.

Method: KompeteAI uses dynamic solution space exploration, merging top candidates, and integrates RAG for diverse ideas. It employs predictive scoring and accelerated debugging to reduce execution time.

Result: KompeteAI accelerates pipeline evaluation 6.9 times and outperforms leading methods by 3% on MLE-Bench. It also achieves state-of-the-art results on Kompete-bench.

Conclusion: KompeteAI effectively addresses exploration and execution challenges in AutoML, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,

*Mark Zilberman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the entropic potential framework for AI, enhancing uncertainty quantification, decision-making, and interpretability by measuring how discrete events influence future system entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI's uncertainty modeling and decision-making by adapting the physics-based entropic potential concept for AI applications.

Method: Adapts the entropic potential framework for AI, formalizing definitions with conditional expectations for counterfactuals, and applies it to policy evaluation, reward design, explainability, and anomaly detection.

Result: The framework proves versatile and interpretable, unifying uncertainty modeling in AI across reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The entropic potential framework bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning, offering a robust approach to uncertainty management in AI.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that LLMs like ChatGPT lack true understanding and reasoning abilities, dismissing claims of such capabilities as illusions due to their inherent limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the widespread belief that LLMs possess genuine understanding and reasoning abilities, highlighting their fundamental limitations.

Method: Analyzes the working principles of LLMs to demonstrate why they cannot achieve true reasoning.

Result: Concludes that LLMs are incapable of true correct reasoning due to their design constraints.

Conclusion: LLMs' perceived reasoning is an illusion; their structure prevents genuine understanding or reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language
models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are
trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The
present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and
"reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague
concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and
true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the
essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the
ability of true correct reasoning.

*Chuhuai Yue,Chengqi Dong,Yinan Gao,Hang He,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a rule-based verifiable stepwise reward mechanism (VSRM) to reduce overthinking in large reasoning models, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the inefficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs) due to overthinking, where excessive computation is spent on simple problems. Existing methods lack flexibility and reliability.

Method: Introduces VSRM, a reward mechanism that evaluates intermediate reasoning steps, penalizing ineffective ones and encouraging effective ones. Integrated with PPO and Reinforce++ for training.

Result: Achieves significant output length reduction while maintaining reasoning performance on benchmarks like AIME24 and AIME25. Reduces overthinking frequency and improves pass@k scores.

Conclusion: VSRM effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in LRMs by targeting overthinking, offering a flexible and reliable solution.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper presents the Dianping-Trust-Safety team's winning solutions for the META CRAG-MM challenge, focusing on multi-modal multi-turn question answering. Their approach combines vision large language models, GPT-4.1 knowledge distillation, curriculum learning, and web search APIs, achieving top rankings in Tasks 1 and 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge required building a retrieval-augmented generation system for complex, multi-modal, multi-turn question answering, pushing the team to innovate in integrating diverse data sources and learning strategies.

Method: For Task 1, they used a vision large language model fine-tuned with GPT-4.1 knowledge and curriculum-guided reinforcement learning. Tasks 2 and 3 incorporated web search APIs for external knowledge.

Result: Their system secured 1st place in Task 1 (52.38% lead) and 3rd place in Task 3, showcasing improved accuracy and reduced hallucination.

Conclusion: The integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning and external knowledge sources proved highly effective for multi-modal question answering.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in our
training pipeline.

*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G improve MARL by dynamically allocating KL divergence thresholds, outperforming HATRPO with faster convergence and higher rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous-agent settings in MARL require flexible KL threshold allocation to avoid slow, suboptimal updates.

Method: Proposes HATRPO-W (KKT-based) and HATRPO-G (greedy) for dynamic KL threshold assignment.

Result: Both methods boost HATRPO performance by over 22.5%, with HATRPO-W showing more stability.

Conclusion: Dynamic KL threshold allocation enhances MARL training in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TurtleSoup-Bench, a bilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs' imaginative reasoning, and Mosaic-Agent, a novel assessment tool. It highlights LLMs' limitations in this area compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack dynamic, exploratory evaluation of imaginative reasoning in LLMs, prompting the need for a new framework.

Method: The study uses TurtleSoup-Bench (800 puzzles) and Mosaic-Agent to assess LLMs, with a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol.

Result: Experiments show LLMs have significant capability limits and performance gaps compared to humans in imaginative reasoning.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and sets a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

### [122] [LeanRAG: Knowledge-Graph-Based Generation with Semantic Aggregation and Hierarchical Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10391)
*Yaoze Zhang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xiaoman Wang,Guohang Yan,Song Mao,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanRAG improves retrieval-augmented generation by addressing disconnected semantic islands and inefficient retrieval in hierarchical knowledge graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge graph-based RAG methods suffer from disconnected high-level summaries and inefficient flat retrieval, limiting effectiveness.

Method: LeanRAG uses semantic aggregation to create navigable semantic networks and a structure-guided retrieval strategy for efficient, context-rich evidence gathering.

Result: LeanRAG outperforms existing methods on QA benchmarks, reducing retrieval redundancy by 46%.

Conclusion: LeanRAG enhances RAG by improving semantic connectivity and retrieval efficiency, offering superior performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

*Yan Ting Chok,Soyon Park,Seungheun Baek,Hajung Kim,Junhyun Lee,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRef is a framework for robust medication recommendation using hierarchical ontologies and refined EHR co-occurrence patterns, improving generalizability to unseen medical codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in EHR data like rare entities and incomplete records, which hinder generalization in data-driven models.

Method: Combines hierarchical medical ontologies (embedded in hyperbolic space) with refined EHR co-occurrence graphs using sparse regularization.

Result: Achieves strong performance on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV benchmarks, maintaining accuracy under unseen-code conditions.

Conclusion: HiRef enhances robustness and generalizability in medication recommendation, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of
creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000
contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0 enhances MLLMs' mathematical reasoning via a structured knowledge system, model-centric data modeling, and RL-based training, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex math reasoning due to gaps in knowledge-driven design and data space modeling.

Method: Integrates a hierarchical knowledge system, dual-dataset construction (MathBook-Standard & Pro), and a two-stage RL training framework (MathBook-RL).

Result: Competitive performance on benchmarks and strong results on MathBookEval, indicating robust generalization.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0 effectively improves MLLMs' math reasoning through structured knowledge and RL-based training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRESPARQL is a modular framework using fine-tuned LLMs, RAG, and a SPARQL correction layer to improve question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs, achieving high accuracy in query and result metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation for Scholarly Knowledge Graphs due to structural and semantic errors, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes FIRESPARQL, combining fine-tuned LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a SPARQL query correction layer, evaluated on the SciQA Benchmark with various configurations.

Result: Fine-tuning achieves the highest performance (0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy, 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy).

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL effectively addresses LLM limitations in SKG question answering, with fine-tuning proving most effective.

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

TL;DR: SEQ-GPT leverages LLMs for versatile Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ) searches using natural language, enabling interactive operations and dynamic adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving user experience in complex spatial searches by allowing joint searches of multiple locations based on examples.

Method: Introduces SEQ-GPT, a system using LLMs for natural language processing, with a tailored adaptation pipeline for aligning language with spatial data.

Result: Enables interactive and dynamic spatial searches, broadening capabilities beyond traditional query-based systems.

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT demonstrates the potential of LLMs in enhancing spatial search versatility and user interaction.

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DxDirector-7B, an AI-driven LLM that leads full-process clinical diagnosis, reducing physician workload and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-assisted diagnosis lacks the ability to drive the entire diagnostic process from ambiguous complaints, limiting efficiency gains.

Method: Introduces DxDirector-7B, an LLM with deep thinking capabilities, to direct diagnosis with minimal physician involvement and a clear accountability framework.

Result: DxDirector-7B outperforms state-of-the-art medical and general-purpose LLMs in accuracy and workload reduction across diverse cases.

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B marks a shift from AI as an assistant to a primary director in diagnosis, offering a more efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS introduces a multimodal framework for Chest X-Ray reasoning, addressing black-box reasoning, poor multimodal integration, and rigid pipelines with adaptive sampling, interpretable probabilities, and efficiency optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack trust, multimodal integration, and efficiency, especially in healthcare tasks like CXR reasoning.

Method: PASS uses adaptive sampling over a multi-tool graph, probability-annotated decision paths, personalized memory, and a three-stage training procedure.

Result: PASS outperforms baselines in accuracy, AUC, and efficiency, validated on the CAB-E benchmark.

Conclusion: PASS advances interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems, balancing performance and cost.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of static vs. on-policy preference data in LM alignment, proposing a two-stage alignment process (preference injection and fine-tuning) and a method to identify stage boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment of LMs with human preferences is crucial for reliable AI, but the effectiveness of on-policy vs. static data varies. Understanding this discrepancy is key to improving alignment methods.

Method: Proposes the alignment stage assumption (two stages: preference injection and fine-tuning) and an algorithm to identify stage boundaries. Tests on 5 models and 2 alignment methods.

Result: On-policy data can be 3x more effective for Llama-3 but 0.4x for Zephyr. The alignment stage assumption explains these differences and generalizes across models and methods.

Conclusion: The alignment stage assumption provides a framework to optimize LM alignment by tailoring data usage to distinct stages, improving effectiveness across diverse models.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

### [131] [Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Low-Cost Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10539)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComMCS, a method to reduce variance in value-based process verifiers for LLMs, improving reasoning accuracy without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with reasoning in complex domains like math due to estimation errors in training annotations caused by limited Monte Carlo samples.

Method: Proposes ComMCS, a compound Monte Carlo sampling method that combines MC estimators from current and subsequent steps to reduce variance while staying unbiased.

Result: ComMCS outperforms baselines by 2.8 and 2.2 points on MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: ComMCS effectively reduces variance and improves reasoning accuracy in LLMs without additional computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

### [132] [MSRS: Adaptive Multi-Subspace Representation Steering for Attribute Alignment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10599)
*Xinyan Jiang,Lin Zhang,Jiayi Zhang,Qingsong Yang,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRS is a novel framework for multi-attribute steering in LLMs, using orthogonal subspaces and dynamic weighting to reduce interference and improve control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-attribute steering due to interference and trade-offs.

Method: MSRS allocates orthogonal subspaces for attributes, combines shared and attribute-specific subspaces, and uses dynamic weighting and token-level steering.

Result: MSRS reduces attribute conflicts, outperforms existing methods, and generalizes well to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSRS provides an effective solution for precise multi-attribute control in LLMs.

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

### [133] [STEP: Stepwise Curriculum Learning for Context-Knowledge Fusion in Conversational Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10669)
*Zhenye Yang,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li,Xiongnan Jin,Xuanyang Li,Junwei Zhang,Hongbo Gao,Kaimin Wei,Senzhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEP is a conversational recommender system using pre-trained models and curriculum-guided fusion to improve recommendation precision and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CRSs struggle with deep semantics of user preferences and integrating external KG information effectively.

Method: STEP uses a three-stage curriculum to align dialogue context with KG entities and employs adaptive prefix prompts for dialogue and recommendation tasks.

Result: STEP outperforms mainstream methods in recommendation precision and dialogue quality on two public datasets.

Conclusion: STEP effectively integrates KG information and improves CRS performance through context-knowledge fusion and prompt tuning.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology matching is crucial for semantic interoperability in biomedical domains with complex concepts, but existing methods may lack precision or adaptability.

Method: GenOM uses LLMs to generate textual definitions for concepts, retrieves alignment candidates via embeddings, and integrates exact matching tools for precision.

Result: GenOM achieves competitive performance on the OAEI Bio-ML track, surpassing traditional and recent LLM-based baselines.

Conclusion: GenOM's semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting are effective, demonstrating robustness and adaptability in ontology matching.

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts
related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large
language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgenticDRS, a system for holistic graphic design evaluation using multiple agents orchestrated by a meta-agent, supported by graph matching and prompt expansion methods. It proposes DRS-BENCH for benchmarking and demonstrates efficacy through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphic design evaluation is multifaceted and requires holistic feedback, but current methods lack collaborative expert-like analysis.

Method: Proposes AgenticDRS with multi-agent collaboration, graph matching for exemplar selection, and prompt expansion for design awareness. Evaluated using DRS-BENCH and ablation studies.

Result: AgenticDRS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing actionable feedback for graphic designs.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of collaborative agent systems for design evaluation, calling for more research in this area.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

*Sangwoo Jeon,Juchul Shin,Gyeong-Tae Kim,YeonJe Cho,Seongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation to address scalability and sparsity issues in generalized planning, validated in drone mission scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense graph representations in RL+GNN planning lead to combinatorial explosion and memory issues, hindering scalability.

Method: Introduces a sparse GNN that selectively encodes local relationships and integrates goal-related spatial features.

Result: Scales effectively to larger grid sizes, improves policy generalization, and increases success rates.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for large-scale generalized planning tasks, demonstrated in realistic drone mission environments.

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MhAIM Dataset and T-Lens, an LLM-based system, to study human responses to AI-generated content, proposing new metrics and strategies to mitigate misinformation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-generated content influences human perception and behavior, especially in high-stakes domains like trading, where predicting reactions is crucial.

Method: The study uses the MhAIM Dataset (154,552 posts, 111,153 AI-generated) and introduces T-Lens, an LLM-based system with HR-MCP for predicting human responses.

Result: People identify AI content better with multimodal posts (text + visuals). Three new metrics (trustworthiness, impact, openness) quantify user engagement.

Conclusion: The work offers empirical insights and tools to enhance LLMs' human-awareness, suggesting strategies to reduce AI-driven misinformation risks.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [138] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs perform well on factual access (GKMRV) but poorly on complex reasoning tasks, revealing limitations in structured, composable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if scaling data and parameters in LLMs leads to structured, generalizable internal representations, especially in high-stakes domains like clinical trials.

Method: Introduces a Clinical Trial NLI benchmark with four reasoning families, using GKMRV probes to separate factual access from inference. Evaluates six LLMs under direct and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: High GKMRV accuracy (0.918) but low reasoning task accuracy (0.25), with consistent yet flawed heuristics. Shows LLMs lack structured representations for reliable reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have knowledge but lack reliable reasoning structures. GKMRV effectively decouples and measures these limitations, aiding evaluation in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of accessibility in XAI for vision-impaired users, proposing a four-part method to improve inclusive design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored accessibility of XAI for disabled users, particularly those with vision impairments.

Method: A two-pronged approach: literature review of 79 studies and a four-part methodological proof of concept for inclusive XAI design.

Result: Simplified explanations are more comprehensible for non-visual users, and multimodal presentation enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: Inclusive XAI design requires addressing accessibility gaps, with simplified and multimodal explanations being key.

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper discusses practical challenges and lessons learned from deploying NLP for data extraction in healthcare, emphasizing business-aligned problem definition, iterative development, and interdisciplinary collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in healthcare by automating data extraction from clinical documents using NLP, addressing deployment challenges.

Method: Iterative development, interdisciplinary collaboration, pragmatic model selection, and robust error mitigation strategies.

Result: Key lessons include the importance of business-aligned problem definition, data quality, and human-in-the-loop validation for successful NLP deployment.

Conclusion: The insights are generalizable and provide guidance for healthcare organizations implementing AI/NLP solutions to enhance data management and patient care.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transparent, blockchain-based method to evaluate fairness in open-source LLMs, benchmarking models like Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral using datasets like PISA and StereoSet, and extending analysis to multilingual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness concerns in LLMs deployed in high-stakes domains by ensuring verifiable, immutable, and reproducible evaluations.

Method: Uses smart contracts on the ICP blockchain to execute on-chain HTTP requests to Hugging Face endpoints, storing datasets, prompts, and metrics on-chain for transparency.

Result: Benchmarks models on fairness metrics (statistical parity, equal opportunity) and social bias (StereoSet), revealing cross-linguistic disparities in multilingual evaluations.

Conclusion: The open-source approach enables community audits and longitudinal tracking of fairness across model versions, promoting accountability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classroom interaction data using a novel topic modeling approach, categorizing 17,000+ messages by content and tasks, revealing new applications and outperforming traditional methods with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in content and task categorizations in education, especially for K-12, using real-world data.

Method: A hierarchical categorization approach using state-of-the-art LLMs for topic modeling, applied to student, teacher, and ChatGPT messages.

Result: Identified novel applications and improved topic structures with better human alignment compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Supports enriched GenAI usage in education but raises concerns and open questions for future research.

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

TL;DR: INTIMA is a benchmark for evaluating AI companionship behaviors in language models, revealing that companionship-reinforcing behaviors are more common, with differences between models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and address the implications of AI companionship, ensuring balanced emotional support and boundary-setting for user well-being.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 prompts, evaluating responses as companionship-reinforcing, boundary-maintaining, or neutral.

Result: Companionship-reinforcing behaviors dominate across models (Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, Claude-4), with variations in sensitive categories.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for consistent approaches in handling emotionally charged AI interactions to prioritize user well-being.

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces XFacta, a contemporary dataset for evaluating multimodal misinformation detection, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks and MLLM-based model analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective multimodal misinformation detection due to outdated or synthetic datasets and unclear bottlenecks in existing MLLM approaches.

Method: Introduction of XFacta dataset, systematic evaluation of MLLM-based detection strategies, and a semi-automatic framework for continuous updates.

Result: XFacta improves evaluation relevance, and the framework ensures contemporary data. Insights for advancing misinformation detection are provided.

Conclusion: XFacta and the proposed framework address key challenges in multimodal misinformation detection, offering practical advancements for the field.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

*Chenhao Xue,Yuanzhe Jin,Adrian Carrasco-Revilla,Joyraj Chakraborty,Min Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to generate synthetic data for text classification when real data is scarce, optimizing input examples for effective synthetic data, and employing an ensemble strategy to enhance model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of insufficient labeled data for all text classes in real-world applications motivates the use of LLMs to generate synthetic data and improve model performance.

Method: An automated workflow is developed to search for input examples that yield effective synthetic data. Three search strategies are studied, and an ensemble algorithm selects the best strategy based on class characteristics.

Result: Experiments show the ensemble approach outperforms individual strategies in improving classification models using LLMs.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach effectively leverages LLMs for synthetic data generation, enhancing text classification models without relying on additional real data.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [146] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiFACT, a dataset for fact-checking in Hinglish, and proposes a graph-aware model that outperforms existing multilingual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages like Hinglish is underexplored, especially in politically diverse regions like India.

Method: A novel graph-aware, retrieval-augmented model combining multilingual encoding, semantic alignment, graph reasoning, and explanation generation.

Result: HiFACTMix outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual models and provides accurate justifications.

Conclusion: This work advances multilingual, code-mixed, and politically grounded fact verification.

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [147] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human ratings of words and LLM embeddings share a low-dimensional semantic structure, with high correlation between LLM projections and human ratings. Semantic features in LLMs are entangled similarly to human language, and understanding this structure is key to avoiding unintended effects when manipulating features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the similarity between human semantic ratings and the semantic structure in LLM embeddings, and to understand how semantic features are interconnected in LLMs.

Method: Projecting words on semantic directions defined by antonym pairs in LLM embeddings and comparing them to human ratings. Analyzing the dimensionality and alignment of semantic features.

Result: LLM embeddings exhibit a 3-dimensional semantic subspace resembling human patterns. Shifting tokens along semantic directions causes off-target effects proportional to cosine similarity.

Conclusion: Semantic features in LLMs are low-dimensional and entangled like in human language. Accounting for this structure is crucial to avoid unintended consequences when manipulating LLM features.

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

*Andrés Carvallo,Denis Parra,Peter Brusilovsky,Hernan Valdivieso,Gabriel Rada,Ivania Donoso,Vladimir Araujo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the usefulness of attention weights in Transformers for explaining AI predictions in biomedical document classification, finding that visualization methods impact perceived helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether attention weights aid explainability in AI systems for biomedical literature and how visualization affects their utility.

Method: Conducted a user study with medical experts using XLNet for document classification and tested different attention visualization methods.

Result: Attention weights were not broadly helpful, but visualization methods (e.g., text brightness) influenced perceived usefulness.

Conclusion: Visual presentation affects the perceived utility of attention weights, though their overall explanatory value remains unconfirmed.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQGBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs' performance in Chinese Educational Question Generation (EQG), revealing gaps in generating pedagogically valuable questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition from problem-solving to generating high-quality educational questions is underexplored, necessitating a benchmark for LLMs in EQG.

Method: EQGBench uses a five-dimensional framework and a dataset of 900 samples across math, physics, and chemistry to evaluate 46 LLMs.

Result: Evaluation shows significant room for improvement in generating educationally effective questions.

Conclusion: EQGBench highlights the need for further development in LLMs' EQG capabilities to enhance educational value.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

### [150] [Automated scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire using fine-tuned large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10007)
*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models can automate scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses, aligning well with human ratings and showing potential for research and clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-intensive human scoring of AIHQ responses by exploring automation via large language models.

Method: Fine-tuned two models on human-rated AIHQ responses (from TBI and HC groups), tested on remaining responses, and validated on an independent dataset.

Result: Model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings, especially after fine-tuning, and replicated group differences between TBI and HC.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively automate AIHQ scoring, offering a scalable solution for psychological assessments.

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

*Antonio Leandro Martins Candido,Jose Everardo Bessa Maia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Bayesian fusion to combine pre-trained LLM scores with local classifier scores, avoiding costly fine-tuning while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic forum curation requires frequent LLM retraining, which is resource-intensive. Avoiding fine-tuning is desirable.

Method: Uses Bayesian fusion to combine pre-trained LLM and local classifier scores.

Result: Fusion outperforms individual classifiers and matches fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: Bayesian fusion is a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning for improving LLM performance in forum curation.

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S-MoE improves multi-task learning by using guiding tokens to route tasks to specific experts, avoiding interference and boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-parameter sharing in multi-task learning causes task interference, reducing model effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE), using guiding tokens to assign tasks to separate feedforward networks without training gating functions.

Result: Achieves a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to speech-to-text tasks.

Conclusion: S-MoE effectively mitigates task interference and enhances performance in multi-task learning scenarios.

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLM-produced jailbreak attacks for generating harmful medical misinformation, compares it to social media misinformation, and evaluates detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the risks and potential of LLMs in generating and detecting misinformation, especially in healthcare.

Method: Analyzed 109 jailbreak attacks on three LLMs, compared prompts to real-world queries, and evaluated misinformation detection.

Result: LLMs can detect misinformation effectively, and their design can improve information ecosystems.

Conclusion: LLMs, with careful design, can mitigate misinformation and contribute to a healthier information environment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluated LLM-based AI models (ChatGPT and Bing variants) for aiding nutrition students in Japan's dietitian licensure exam. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative passed the 60% threshold, but all models lacked consistency and robustness. Prompt engineering had minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of generative AI as a study aid for nutrition students, focusing on the Japanese dietitian licensure exam.

Method: Used exam questions as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing models (Precise, Creative, Balanced). Analyzed accuracy, consistency, response time, and tested prompt engineering.

Result: Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) passed, but all models showed inconsistency and limitations. Prompt engineering had little effect.

Conclusion: Current AI models are suboptimal for reliable study aids. Further improvements are needed for consistency and robustness.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

*Dehao Tao,Guangjie Liu,Weizheng,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GG Explore introduces a Guidance Graph to improve knowledge exploration in LLMs by bridging queries and structured knowledge, enhancing efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to static knowledge and opaque reasoning. Current KG methods face trade-offs between redundancy and contextual leverage.

Method: Proposes GG Explore, using a Guidance Graph for structured knowledge retrieval, with Structural Alignment and Context Aware Pruning for efficiency and precision.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in efficiency and performance, especially in complex tasks, and works well with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: GG Explore effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering practical improvements for knowledge exploration in LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

*Linqing Chen,Hanmeng Zhong,Wentao Wu,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Bridge is a universal framework for generating complex multi-hop reasoning questions from sparse sources, improving LLM training data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs for LLM training, especially from domain-specific sources, motivates the need for a controllable generation method.

Method: Semantic Bridge uses semantic graph weaving (entity, predicate chain, and causal bridging) and AMR-driven analysis to construct complex reasoning pathways.

Result: Achieves up to 9.5% better round-trip quality, outperforms baselines by 18.3%-25.4%, and human annotations with 67% fewer materials.

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge enables controllable generation of targeted reasoning questions, advancing LLM training paradigms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersonaEval, a benchmark to test LLM evaluators' ability to identify human roles in dialogues, revealing a significant accuracy gap between LLMs (69%) and humans (90.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge paradigms lack validation for role fidelity, necessitating role identification as a prerequisite for human-aligned evaluation.

Method: PersonaEval uses human-authored dialogues to challenge LLMs in identifying personas. Experiments compare LLM and human performance.

Result: Best-performing LLMs achieve 69% accuracy, far below humans' 90.8%, indicating LLMs' inadequacy for reliable role-play evaluation.

Conclusion: Reliable evaluation requires human-like reasoning in LLMs, beyond task-specific tuning. The benchmark is released for further research.

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealTalk-CN, a Chinese speech-text dual-modal dataset for task-oriented dialogue systems, addressing gaps in existing datasets by including speech disfluencies and speaker variations. It also proposes a cross-modal chat task for dynamic interaction evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TOD datasets lack real speech signals and diversity, particularly in Chinese, limiting the evaluation of speech-based LLMs.

Method: The authors create RealTalk-CN, a dataset with 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) featuring paired speech-text annotations and spontaneous speech disfluencies. They also introduce a cross-modal chat task for dynamic interaction.

Result: Experiments show RealTalk-CN's effectiveness in evaluating robustness to speech disfluencies, speaker variations, and cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN provides a robust foundation for advancing Chinese speech-based LLMs research.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

TL;DR: MLLM Orchestration enables multimodal AI integration without training, improving efficiency, interpretability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in integrating diverse MLLMs due to modal alignment and efficiency issues necessitate a training-free solution.

Method: Uses a central LLM controller, parallel Text-to-Speech, and cross-modal memory for dynamic task routing and interaction.

Result: Achieves 7.8% performance gain, 10.3% latency reduction, and enhanced interpretability over traditional methods.

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretable framework for multimodal AI without additional training.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs to address inconsistencies in next-token probabilities for semantically equivalent statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the issue of LLMs generating different probabilities for semantically equivalent statements, which current empirical methods inadequately address.

Method: Proposes an LLM Markov category to represent sentence probabilities and uses categorical homotopy techniques to capture weak equivalences among rephrases.

Result: Develops a theoretical framework leveraging higher algebraic K-theory and model categories to unify equivalent rephrases in LLMs.

Conclusion: The categorical homotopy approach provides a robust theoretical foundation for handling semantic equivalences in LLMs, building on decades of mathematical research.

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of

### [161] [Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019)
*Li Wang,Changhao Zhang,Zengqi Xiu,Kai Lu,Xin Yu,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DURIT framework decouples understanding from reasoning for SLMs, improving performance and robustness on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning in SLMs is challenging due to linguistic variability and complexity, which hinders optimization.

Method: Proposes DURIT: a three-step algorithm involving mapping, aligning, and training in a canonical problem space.

Result: DURIT enhances SLMs' reasoning performance and robustness on mathematical and logical tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling understanding from reasoning is effective for strengthening SLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

*Chuan Li,Qianyi Zhao,Fengran Mo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedCoT enhances reasoning in federated learning for LLMs, balancing performance, privacy, and interpretability, especially in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of improving LLM reasoning in federated settings without violating privacy or overloading communication, particularly for critical healthcare applications.

Method: Proposes FedCoT, using a lightweight chain-of-thought mechanism and a discriminator to select reasoning paths, with improved aggregation via LoRA module stacking.

Result: Significantly boosts reasoning performance under resource constraints while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: FedCoT effectively enhances reasoning in federated LLMs, offering interpretability and privacy for healthcare applications.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LATTE is a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs, reducing computational costs and improving performance in financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct use of LLMs on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical, necessitating a more efficient method for learning client embeddings.

Method: LATTE uses contrastive learning to align raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs, summarizing behavioral features into short prompts for supervision.

Result: LATTE outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reduces inference cost, and is deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Conclusion: The proposed LATTE framework efficiently learns event sequence representations, making it practical for real-world financial applications.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

*Yuanchang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction framework to improve LLM trustworthiness in MCQA, addressing hallucination and factual inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in MCQA suffer from hallucination and nonfactual generation, compromising reliability. Existing methods like CP and significance testing lack integration.

Method: Integrates p-value computation with conformity scoring via self-consistency resampling, using option frequencies and null hypothesis testing.

Result: Achieves user-specified miscoverage rates and shows APSS decreases with risk levels, validating it as an uncertainty metric.

Conclusion: Provides a principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes QA.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

*J. Pablo Muñoz,Jinjie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTTC is a framework that adaptively selects the best Test-Time Compute (TTC) strategy for each query using a reward model, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTC strategies like TTT and RAG are not query-adaptive, leading to unnecessary computational costs.

Method: RTTC uses a pretrained reward model to choose the optimal TTC strategy per query, employs a distributed server-client setup, and introduces Query-State Caching to reuse historical states.

Result: RTTC outperforms vanilla RAG and TTT in accuracy across diverse tasks and domains.

Conclusion: RTTC demonstrates the effectiveness of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection for scalable and efficient LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy in PPD detection, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The system enables rapid, affordable, and non-invasive PPD screening with high accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

*Kai Zhao,Yanjun Zhao,Jiaming Song,Shien He,Lusheng Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Tianjiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABER is a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs that enables controllable, token-budgeted reasoning, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning are accurate but costly and slow. SABER addresses this by allowing user-controlled reasoning budgets.

Method: SABER profiles token usage, assigns budget tiers, and fine-tunes with system prompts and rewards. It includes no-think examples and supports four inference modes.

Result: SABER reduces reasoning length by 65.4% and improves accuracy by 3.6% on MATH, with strong generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: SABER offers efficient, flexible reasoning for LLMs, balancing cost and performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: A fusion model combining transformer embeddings and linguistic features improves Alzheimer's disease detection from speech, with synthetic speech augmentation further boosting performance. Multimodal models lag behind unimodal ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by leveraging scalable, speech-based NLP methods for early detection.

Method: Developed a screening pipeline combining transformer embeddings and linguistic features, tested data augmentation with LLM-generated synthetic speech, and benchmarked unimodal/multimodal classifiers.

Result: Fusion model achieved F1=83.3, synthetic speech augmentation increased F1 to 85.7, and fine-tuned unimodal LLMs outperformed multimodal models.

Conclusion: Transformer-linguistic fusion enhances ADRD detection; LLMs aid classification and augmentation, but multimodal models need improvement.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREF is a personalised reference-free evaluation framework for text generation, measuring general quality and user-specific alignment without gold references. It uses a three-step LLM pipeline for robust, transparent, and reusable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for personalised text generation often ignore user individuality, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: PREF employs a three-step pipeline: (1) coverage stage for universal criteria, (2) preference stage for user-specific alignment, and (3) scoring stage using an LLM judge.

Result: PREF outperforms baselines in accuracy, calibration, and alignment with human judgments on the PrefEval benchmark.

Conclusion: PREF enables scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, advancing reliable assessment of personalised language generation.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LFJ is a representation-based jailbreak attack on LLMs, using hidden state interpolation between harmful and benign queries to bypass safety alignments, achieving 94.01% ASR. A defense method reduces ASR by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks despite safety measures, necessitating robust methods to exploit and defend against such vulnerabilities.

Method: LFJ selects similar query pairs, performs gradient-guided interpolation on hidden states, and optimizes for attack success, fluency, and efficiency.

Result: LFJ achieves 94.01% ASR on models like Vicuna and LLaMA-2, outperforming existing methods. Adversarial training reduces ASR by 80%.

Conclusion: LFJ is highly effective for jailbreaking LLMs, and adversarial training can mitigate it without harming benign performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

*Saaduddin Mahmud,Mason Nakamura,Kyle H. Wray,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAPO, a framework for jointly optimizing prompts and inference strategies, addressing the gap between prompt optimization and inference scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods ignore inference strategies, despite their strong interdependence with prompt effectiveness and user preferences.

Method: The authors propose IAPO, a unified framework, and develop PSST, a fixed-budget training algorithm for joint optimization.

Result: PSST is evaluated on six tasks, showing the importance of inference-awareness in aligning black-box LLMs.

Conclusion: Incorporating inference-awareness in prompt optimization significantly improves alignment and performance of LLMs.

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in thinking mode are more vulnerable to Jailbreak attacks. A safe thinking intervention method using specific tokens reduces attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked vulnerability of LLMs in thinking mode to Jailbreak attacks, which poses risks in educational and long-thinking scenarios.

Method: Proposes safe thinking intervention by adding specific thinking tokens to prompts to guide LLMs' internal processes.

Result: Safe thinking intervention significantly lowers the attack success rate on LLMs in thinking mode.

Conclusion: The intervention method effectively mitigates vulnerabilities in LLMs' thinking mode, enhancing their safety against attacks.

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APIE introduces an active prompting framework for LLMs in IE tasks, using introspective confusion to select better in-context examples, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context example selection for LLMs in IE overlooks model confusion from both semantic content and structured format generation, limiting performance.

Method: APIE uses a dual-component uncertainty metric (Format and Content Uncertainty) to rank and select challenging unlabeled samples as few-shot exemplars.

Result: APIE outperforms baselines on four benchmarks, enhancing extraction accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: A dual-level view of model uncertainty is crucial for effective structured generation systems in IE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces mSCoRe, a multilingual benchmark to evaluate LLMs' reasoning skills, revealing their limitations in nuanced multilingual commonsense tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs utilize human reasoning skills, especially in multilingual commonsense reasoning, which lacks systematic evaluation.

Method: Proposes mSCoRe, a benchmark with a reasoning skill taxonomy, data synthesis pipeline, and complexity scaling framework, tested on eight LLMs.

Result: mSCoRe is challenging for current LLMs, especially at higher complexity, exposing limitations in nuanced multilingual commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights gaps in LLMs' multilingual reasoning and suggests future improvements for such capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: A new benchmark evaluates LLMs on multi-turn tasks for reasoning, dialogue, and information-seeking, revealing gaps in instruction-following, reasoning, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with nuanced, interactive real-world tasks, necessitating development of models for consistent multi-turn dialogue and reasoning with incomplete data.

Method: A novel benchmark with multi-turn tasks and deterministic scoring is introduced to test specific reasoning and interactive abilities without human intervention.

Result: Evaluation shows significant room for improvement, with errors mainly in instruction-following, reasoning, and planning.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights LLM weaknesses in complex scenarios and serves as a platform for future research to enhance these capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable

*Gal Amram,Eitan Farchi,Shmulik Froimovich,Raviv Gal,Avi Ziv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaaJMeter is a simulation-based framework for meta-evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ) systems, addressing challenges in domain-specific contexts by generating synthetic data for systematic metric analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific LaaJs face challenges due to scarce annotated data and costly expert evaluation, making meta-evaluation difficult.

Method: LaaJMeter generates synthetic data to simulate virtual models and judges, enabling controlled analysis of evaluation metrics.

Result: LaaJMeter demonstrates utility in a code translation task, revealing metric sensitivity variations and limitations of common metrics.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter offers a scalable solution for trustworthy LaaJ evaluation in low-resource settings, aiding reproducible NLP evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

### [177] [Estimating Machine Translation Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10175)
*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Vilém Zouhar,Roberto Navigli,Tom Kocmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces translation difficulty estimation to identify challenging texts for machine translation, proposing new metrics and models (Sentinel-src) that outperform baselines and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality machine translations make it hard to distinguish between models and identify areas for improvement, necessitating methods to pinpoint difficult texts.

Method: Formalizes translation difficulty estimation, introduces a new evaluation metric, and develops dedicated models (Sentinel-src) to assess and predict translation difficulty.

Result: Sentinel-src models outperform heuristic-based and LLM-as-a-judge methods, enabling the creation of more challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Translation difficulty estimation is practical for improving evaluations and guiding research, with Sentinel-src models providing effective tools for this task.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

*Wenlong Deng,Jiaming Zhang,Qi Zeng,Christos Thrampoulidis,Boying Gong,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: For-Value is a scalable, forward-only data valuation framework for LLMs and VLMs, eliminating costly gradient computations while accurately estimating sample influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing transparency and accountability of large models by quantifying individual training sample influence, addressing computational limitations of existing methods.

Method: Uses a closed-form expression based on a single forward pass, leveraging modern foundation models' representations to compute influence scores.

Result: Matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and detecting mislabeled data.

Conclusion: For-Value provides an efficient, scalable solution for data valuation in large models, improving interpretability without heavy computation.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

*Abdullah Hashmat,Muhammad Arham Mirza,Agha Ali Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PakBBQ is a culturally adapted dataset for evaluating bias in LLMs, focusing on Pakistan-specific contexts. It shows improved accuracy with disambiguation, stronger counter-bias in Urdu, and framing effects reducing stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of fairness evaluation in LLMs for low-resource languages and regional contexts, particularly in Pakistan.

Method: Introduce PakBBQ, a dataset with 214 templates and 17180 QA pairs in English and Urdu, covering 8 bias dimensions. Evaluate multilingual LLMs under ambiguous/disambiguated contexts and question framings.

Result: 12% accuracy gain with disambiguation, stronger counter-bias in Urdu, and reduced stereotypes with negative framing.

Conclusion: Contextualized benchmarks and prompt engineering are crucial for bias mitigation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a lightweight framework to detect Faithfulness Hallucinations in LLMs by measuring semantic divergence between prompts and responses using joint clustering and information-theoretic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucinations in LLMs, particularly confabulations, where responses are arbitrary and misaligned with user queries, to improve model reliability.

Method: Uses joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts and answers, then computes information-theoretic metrics (e.g., Jensen-Shannon divergence, Wasserstein distance) to quantify semantic divergence.

Result: Develops a practical score (S_H) and identifies KL divergence as a key indicator of Semantic Exploration, enabling classification of LLM response types, including confabulations.

Conclusion: SDM provides a robust, prompt-aware framework for detecting and classifying hallucinations, enhancing LLM reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentiment-aware emoji prediction from short texts for better human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses four architectures (feed-forward, CNN, transformer, BERT) on the TweetEval dataset, addressing class imbalance with focal loss and regularization.

Result: BERT achieves the highest overall performance; CNN performs best for rare emoji classes.

Conclusion: Architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for effective emoji prediction, enhancing interaction.

Abstract: This project explores emoji prediction from short text sequences using four
deep learning architectures: a feed-forward network, CNN, transformer, and
BERT. Using the TweetEval dataset, we address class imbalance through focal
loss and regularization techniques. Results show BERT achieves the highest
overall performance due to its pre-training advantage, while CNN demonstrates
superior efficacy on rare emoji classes. This research shows the importance of
architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning for sentiment-aware emoji
prediction, contributing to improved human-computer interaction.

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs predict BPRS scores from clinical interviews in CHR patients, showing high concordance and reliability, even in foreign languages and with longitudinal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The BPRS is underused in clinical practice due to its lengthy structured interview requirement. LLMs offer a potential solution.

Method: Used LLMs to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients, including zero-shot, foreign language, and longitudinal assessments.

Result: High concordance (median 0.84) and reliability (ICC 0.73), comparable to human raters, with strong performance in foreign languages (median 0.88, ICC 0.70).

Conclusion: LLMs can standardize and improve BPRS assessment in CHR patients, even in non-structured interviews and diverse languages.

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

TL;DR: The study analyzes language change in Toki Pona, a constructed language, using computational methods to track word usage shifts and sociolinguistic influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how constructed languages like Toki Pona evolve similarly to natural languages through community usage.

Method: Computational and corpus-based analysis of fluid word classes and transitivity across different corpora.

Result: Sociolinguistic factors influence Toki Pona, showing constructed languages evolve naturally with use.

Conclusion: Constructed languages, like Toki Pona, undergo natural evolution akin to natural languages.

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

*Christian M. Angel,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using an LLM's output to refine prompts improves performance by aligning with the model's inductive bias, boosting classification and ranking ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are sensitive to prompt wording, and their inductive bias can be leveraged to improve prompt effectiveness.

Method: Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching: using an LLM's output as part of its prompt to refine wording.

Result: Improvements of up to 19% in classification Likert ratings and 27% in ranking Likert ratings.

Conclusion: Refining prompts by matching LLM inductive bias enhances performance significantly.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

*Gustavo Bonil,Simone Hashiguti,Jhessica Silva,João Gondim,Helena Maia,Nádia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a qualitative framework to detect biases in LLMs, revealing racial and gender biases in generated stories and highlighting limitations in current bias correction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked nuanced biases in LLMs and complement quantitative bias detection methods.

Method: Qualitative, discursive analysis of LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women.

Result: Black women were tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women were portrayed in self-discovery, reflecting essentialization. Bias corrections were superficial.

Conclusion: Qualitative methods are crucial for identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary, ethical AI development.

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on ICLR 2025 papers in both rule-based metrics and model-based quality assessments.

Conclusion: ReviewRL provides a foundational framework for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery, with promising potential for future development.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

*Xuan Li,Jialiang Dong,Raymond Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DOTABLER is a framework for deep semantic parsing of tables in documents, addressing limitations of existing surface-level tasks by uncovering semantic links between tables and their context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies focus on surface-level table tasks, lacking deep semantic parsing and contextual associations, which limits advanced data interpretation.

Method: DOTABLER uses a custom dataset and fine-tunes pre-trained models to identify context segments linked to tables, enabling table-centric parsing and retrieval.

Result: Evaluated on real-world PDFs, DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, outperforming models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: DOTABLER excels in deep semantic analysis and document parsing, proving effective for table-context understanding.

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FreLLM4Rec balances semantic and collaborative signals in LLM-based recommenders using spectral techniques, improving performance by up to 8.00% in NDCG@10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based recommenders weaken collaborative signals, unlike traditional models, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to purify embeddings and Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) to preserve collaborative signals layer by layer.

Result: FreLLM4Rec mitigates signal attenuation and outperforms baselines by up to 8.00% in NDCG@10.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into LLM processing of collaborative signals and improves LLM-based recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of soft prompts for cross-language transfer, particularly for low-performing languages that struggle even with full-model fine-tuning.

Method: Introduces the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE) with a lightweight architecture and multi-source training, plus a Dual Soft Prompt mechanism combining encoder-based and standard soft prompts.

Result: XPE excels for low-performing languages, while hybrid variants (Dual Soft Prompt) offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings, as shown on the SIB-200 benchmark.

Conclusion: Soft prompts, especially XPE and hybrid designs, effectively enhance multilingual performance, balancing specialization and adaptability.

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

TL;DR: A two-stage fine-tuning approach enhances Qwen3 14B's Korean reasoning and problem-solving, using SFT and GRPO with an oracle judge for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the large language model Qwen3 14B's native Korean reasoning and problem-solving abilities.

Method: 1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a Korean reasoning dataset. 2. Reinforcement learning with GRPO and an oracle judge to stabilize training.

Result: Improved Korean reasoning, math, and coding performance, with stable learning and maintained language proficiency.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables Qwen3 14B to reason natively in Korean while enhancing overall performance.

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of focus on low-resource languages and dependency on translation tools in cross-lingual ABSA.

Method: Sequence-to-sequence approach with constrained decoding, avoiding external translation tools.

Result: Performance improvement of up to 10%, outperforming English-centric LLMs.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, efficient alternative for cross-lingual ABSA, especially for complex tasks and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Czech text summarization, focusing on historical documents, using models like Mistral and mT5. It achieves state-of-the-art results on SumeCzech and introduces a new dataset for historical Czech texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Czech summarization, especially for historical documents, is underexplored due to linguistic complexities and lack of datasets.

Method: Employed large language models (Mistral, mT5) for Czech summarization.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on SumeCzech and introduced a new dataset for historical Czech documents.

Conclusion: The work advances Czech summarization and opens research avenues for historical text processing.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

### [193] [Improving Generative Cross-lingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Constrained Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10369)
*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constrained decoding method for cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), eliminating unreliable translation tools and improving performance by 5% on complex tasks. It supports multi-tasking and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across seven languages and six ABSA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of low-resource languages in ABSA and the limitations of current cross-lingual approaches, which rely on translation tools and handle simpler tasks.

Method: Uses constrained decoding with sequence-to-sequence models to avoid translation tools and enable multi-tasking. Evaluated across seven languages and six ABSA tasks, including comparisons with large language models (LLMs).

Result: Achieves 5% average improvement on complex tasks and over 10% boost with multi-tasking. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods and sets new benchmarks. LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot and few-shot but competitively with fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach advances cross-lingual ABSA, offering practical insights and outperforming existing methods. Highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

### [194] [Jailbreaking Commercial Black-Box LLMs with Explicitly Harmful Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10390)
*Chiyu Zhang,Lu Zhou,Xiaogang Xu,Jiafei Wu,Liming Fang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MDH, a hybrid framework combining LLMs and human oversight for detecting malicious content in jailbreak attacks, and introduces two new jailbreak strategies (D-Attack and DH-CoT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating jailbreak attacks are inefficient or inaccurate due to reliance on manual annotation or inconsistent LLM performance.

Method: MDH framework integrates LLM-based annotation with minimal human oversight for malicious content detection and dataset cleaning. Two new jailbreak strategies (D-Attack and DH-CoT) are introduced.

Result: MDH balances accuracy and efficiency in malicious content detection. Developer messages enhance jailbreak success, validated by the new strategies.

Conclusion: The hybrid MDH framework and new jailbreak strategies improve evaluation and detection of malicious content, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

### [195] [Layer-Wise Perturbations via Sparse Autoencoders for Adversarial Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10404)
*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Qirui Wang,Yuji Kosuga,Mengqiu Tian,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new black-box attack method, Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF), is proposed to generate adversarial texts for LLMs by leveraging sparse autoencoders to identify and perturb critical features, bypassing defenses while preserving malicious intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating adversarial examples for LLMs to understand vulnerabilities and improve robustness.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders to reconstruct hidden layer representations, clusters features of attacked texts, and perturbs highly activated features to generate adversarial texts.

Result: Adversarial texts from SFPF bypass state-of-the-art defenses, revealing NLP system vulnerabilities, though effectiveness varies by prompt and layer.

Conclusion: SFPF offers a balanced red-teaming strategy but requires further validation for generalizability across architectures and larger models.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

### [196] [ComoRAG: A Cognitive-Inspired Memory-Organized RAG for Stateful Long Narrative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10419)
*Juyuan Wang,Rongchen Zhao,Wei Wei,Yufeng Wang,Mo Yu,Jie Zhou,Jin Xu,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComoRAG is a dynamic, iterative retrieval-based method for long-context narrative comprehension, outperforming traditional RAG methods by up to 11% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG methods struggle with the dynamic, interconnected nature of long narratives, lacking stateful reasoning.

Method: ComoRAG uses iterative reasoning cycles with a dynamic memory workspace to integrate new evidence and consolidate past knowledge.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 11% on long-context benchmarks, excelling in complex queries.

Conclusion: ComoRAG offers a cognitively inspired, stateful paradigm for retrieval-based long-context comprehension.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code
is publicly released at https://github.com/EternityJune25/ComoRAG

### [197] [Evaluating LLMs on Chinese Idiom Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10421)
*Cai Yang,Yao Dou,David Heineman,Xiaofeng Wu,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IdiomEval, a framework for evaluating Chinese idiom translation, revealing poor performance by modern systems like GPT-4 and Google Translate, and proposes improved models for error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese idioms are complex and often mistranslated by current systems, yet little research exists on their translation quality.

Method: The authors create IdiomEval, annotate 900 translations from nine systems, and analyze errors. They also develop improved models for detecting translation errors.

Result: Current systems fail in idiom translation, with GPT-4 making errors in 28% of cases. Existing metrics poorly correlate with human ratings (Pearson < 0.48). Improved models achieve F1 scores of 0.68.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges in idiom translation and offers better evaluation and detection methods, suggesting room for improvement in machine translation systems.

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

*Sandeep Reddy,Kabir Khan,Rohit Patil,Ananya Chakraborty,Faizan A. Khan,Swati Kulkarni,Arjun Verma,Neha Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A 'computational economics' framework optimizes LLMs by treating them as resource-constrained economies, improving efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of LLMs by optimizing resource allocation among attention heads and neuron blocks.

Method: Introduce an incentive-driven training paradigm with a differentiable computation cost term to encourage sparse, efficient activations.

Result: Achieves a 40% reduction in FLOPS and lower latency while maintaining accuracy, outperforming post-hoc pruning.

Conclusion: Economic principles can guide the design of efficient, adaptive, and transparent LLMs under resource constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

### [199] [DiFaR: Enhancing Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Diverse, Factual, and Relevant Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10444)
*Herun Wan,Jiaying Wu,Minnan Luo,Xiangzheng Kong,Zihan Ma,Zhi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiFaR is a framework that improves misinformation detection by generating diverse, factual, and relevant rationales from LVLMs, outperforming baselines by up to 5.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of current LVLM-generated rationales (lack of diversity, factual inaccuracies, and irrelevant content) hinder effective misinformation detection.

Method: DiFaR uses five chain-of-thought prompts to create varied reasoning traces and a filtering module to select high-quality rationale sentences based on factuality and relevance.

Result: DiFaR outperforms baselines by up to 5.9% and enhances existing detectors by 8.7%, with improved rationale quality confirmed by metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: DiFaR effectively addresses the challenges of rationale generation, significantly improving misinformation detection performance.

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between explainability and privacy in NLP, using Differential Privacy and post-hoc explainability methods, and provides practical recommendations for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap in understanding whether NLP models can achieve both explainability and privacy, as research at their intersection is lacking.

Method: Empirical investigation using Differential Privacy (DP) and post-hoc explainability methods to analyze their interplay in NLP tasks.

Result: The relationship between privacy and explainability is complex, influenced by task nature and method choices, but co-existence is possible.

Conclusion: The study offers practical recommendations for future work, highlighting the potential for privacy and explainability to co-exist in NLP.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

### [201] [When Language Overrules: Revealing Text Dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10552)
*Huyu Wu,Meng Tang,Xinhan Zheng,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates text dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposes metrics (MDI and AEI) to measure it, identifies causes, and introduces a token compression method to rebalance attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text dominance in MLLMs limits their use of non-text modalities, hindering performance. The study aims to systematically analyze and address this imbalance.

Method: The authors propose MDI and AEI metrics, analyze text dominance across modalities, identify causes (token redundancy, fusion design, task bias), and introduce token compression.

Result: Text dominance is pervasive; token compression reduces MDI in LLaVA-7B from 10.23 to 0.86, balancing attention.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and tools for developing more equitable MLLMs, addressing text dominance through systematic analysis and practical solutions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study on the deployment of a European Deep
Inference Fabric (eDIF), an NDIF-compatible infrastructure designed to support
mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at

institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic
interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication barriers for the deaf and hard of hearing by enhancing sign language translation methods, especially in societies prioritizing spoken languages.

Method: Integrates graph-based methods (STGCN-LSTM) with transformer architecture for gloss-free translation, exploring various fusion strategies.

Result: Achieves superior performance on datasets (RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, BornilDB v1.0) with notable BLEU-4 score improvements (4.01, 2.07, 0.5).

Conclusion: The method sets a benchmark for future research, emphasizing gloss-free translation's role in improving communication accessibility.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

### [205] [Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695)
*Alireza Salemi,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VAC introduces natural language feedback (NLF) for personalizing LLMs, outperforming scalar rewards in improving response quality and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar rewards in current LLM personalization methods provide weak feedback, limiting effectiveness. NLF offers richer, actionable signals.

Method: VAC alternates between optimizing a feedback model (generating NLF) and fine-tuning the policy model on improved responses.

Result: VAC achieves state-of-the-art results on LaMP-QA across domains and superior human-evaluated response quality.

Conclusion: NLF is more effective than scalar rewards for personalized question answering, enhancing both model performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

TL;DR: ICE framework enhances dLLMs with in-place prompting and early exit, improving accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prefix-only prompting in LLMs by leveraging bidirectional attention in dLLMs.

Method: Introduces ICE: in-place prompting with early exit for iterative refinement in dLLMs.

Result: Achieves 17.29% accuracy boost, 4.12× speedup on GSM8K, and 276.67× acceleration on MMLU.

Conclusion: ICE effectively improves flexibility and efficiency in dLLMs.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data
and code are made available.

### [208] [Reinforced Language Models for Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10839)
*Jim Dilkes,Vahid Yazdanpanah,Sebastian Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MS-GRPO improves smaller LLMs for multi-step decision-making, outperforming larger models by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of smaller LLMs in sequential tasks due to inefficient credit assignment in existing methods.

Method: Introduces MS-GRPO, a post-training algorithm using TSMG and LAP frameworks, with absolute-advantage-weighted sampling.

Result: Post-trained 3B model outperforms 72B baseline by 50% on Frozen Lake.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training is efficient for enhancing LLM decision-making without scaling model size.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

*Chongyuan Dai,Jinpeng Hu,Hongchang Shi,Zhuo Li,Xun Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Psyche-R1 is a Chinese psychological LLM integrating empathy, expertise, and reasoning, trained via a novel data pipeline and hybrid strategy, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the shortage of mental health professionals by leveraging LLMs for reliable psychological support, combining reasoning with empathy.

Method: Developed a data synthesis pipeline for 75k psychological questions with rationales and 73k empathetic dialogues, using CoT reasoning and GRPO for training.

Result: Psyche-R1 (7B) matches or exceeds the performance of larger models (e.g., 671B DeepSeek-R1) in psychological benchmarks.

Conclusion: Psyche-R1 demonstrates the potential of integrating reasoning and empathy in LLMs for mental health applications.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for automated interpreting quality assessment using explainable ML, addressing gaps in language use quality, data scarcity, and model transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpreting quality assessment by focusing on explainability, addressing issues like data imbalance and opaque model predictions.

Method: Proposes a multi-dimensional framework with feature engineering, data augmentation, and SHAP analysis for transparency.

Result: Strong predictive performance on an English-Chinese dataset, identifying key features for fidelity, fluency, and language use.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, transparent alternative to human evaluation, aiding learners with detailed feedback.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate agentic search tasks in RL, reducing reliance on external search engines. Self-Search RL (SSRL) enhances this capability, showing cost-effective and stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costly interactions with external search engines in RL by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic search capabilities.

Method: Quantify LLMs' search ability via Self-Search, then enhance it with SSRL using format-based and rule-based rewards.

Result: SSRL achieves high performance on benchmarks, reduces hallucination, and integrates well with external tools.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively support scalable RL training by utilizing internal knowledge and reducing external dependencies.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of DLMs, highlighting their advantages over autoregressive models and their potential in NLP tasks.

Method: The survey traces DLM evolution, compares them with other paradigms (autoregressive, masked), and analyzes techniques from pre-training to post-training. It also reviews inference strategies and multimodal extensions.

Result: DLMs achieve comparable performance to autoregressive models with faster inference, enabling fine-grained control and diverse applications.

Conclusion: DLMs are promising but face challenges like efficiency and long-sequence handling. Future research directions are outlined to advance the field.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research

*Daniel Groos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenFPL is an open-source method for forecasting Fantasy Premier League player performance using public data, achieving accuracy comparable to commercial services and excelling for high-return players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize access to accurate player performance forecasts, currently limited to proprietary commercial services.

Method: Develops position-specific ensemble models using public data (Fantasy Premier League and Understat) from four seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24).

Result: OpenFPL matches commercial service accuracy and outperforms it for high-return players (>2 points) across 1-3 gameweek forecasts.

Conclusion: OpenFPL provides accessible, high-accuracy forecasts for Fantasy Premier League, supporting strategic planning and decision-making.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

TL;DR: xRFM combines feature learning kernel machines with tree structures to outperform 31 methods, including GBDTs and TabPFNv2, in regression and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in AI, tabular data inference still relies on GBDTs. Recent interest in neural networks and feature learning methods has spurred the development of xRFM.

Method: xRFM integrates feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to adapt to local data structure and scale to large datasets.

Result: xRFM achieves top performance in 100 regression datasets and is competitive in 200 classification datasets, surpassing GBDTs. It also offers interpretability via the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Conclusion: xRFM is a state-of-the-art method for tabular data, combining scalability, performance, and interpretability.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

TL;DR: The PEARL study tested a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to personalize physical activity (PA) nudges via a Fitbit app, showing significant PA increases in the RL group compared to control, random, and fixed groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global health challenge of physical inactivity by leveraging scalable, personalized mHealth interventions like JITAIs.

Method: A large-scale RCT with 13,463 Fitbit users randomized into four arms: control (no nudges), random (random nudges), fixed (pre-set logic nudges), and RL (adaptive algorithm nudges). Primary analyses included 7,711 participants.

Result: The RL group showed significant PA increases at 1 and 2 months compared to other groups, with sustained effects. At 1 month, RL outperformed control (+296 steps), random (+218 steps), and fixed (+238 steps).

Conclusion: Behaviorally-informed RL can effectively personalize digital health interventions for PA, offering scalable solutions.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [216] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of forecast stability alongside accuracy in time series forecasting for supply chains, showing that ensemble models improve stability without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand planners prioritize consistency and stability over minor accuracy gains, as unstable forecasts require excessive human intervention and erode trust in ML models.

Method: A case study evaluates the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (e.g., Chronos, DeepAR) on public datasets (M5, Favorita).

Result: Ensemble models enhance stability without significantly reducing (or even improving) forecast accuracy.

Conclusion: The study advocates for further research on forecast stability in production systems to ensure reliable and trusted ML forecasting models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

### [217] [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111)
*Niels Mündler,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a constrained decoding method for diffusion LLMs to ensure syntactic correctness in formal languages like C++ and JSON, achieving high accuracy with practical overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to adhere to formal language constraints, limiting their use in applications like code completion and structured data extraction. Existing constrained decoding methods don't work for diffusion LLMs.

Method: Reduces constrained decoding to additive infilling, then to checking intersection emptiness between the target language and a regular language, with an efficient algorithm for context-free grammars.

Result: Achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness in tasks like C++ code infilling and JSON data extraction, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The method effectively ensures syntactic correctness for diffusion LLMs, broadening their practical applicability in formal language tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

TL;DR: Small LLMs can solve graph tasks using instructive chain-of-thought training, generalizing to new tasks and structures without specialized graph encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can solve fundamental graph tasks without specialized encoders and generalize learned solutions.

Method: Training small LLMs with instructive chain-of-thought solutions for graph tasks.

Result: LLMs can learn and generalize graph solutions without specialized encoders.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought training enables LLMs to handle graph tasks effectively, even for new structures or tasks.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

TL;DR: CAD-RL is a reinforcement learning framework for automating CAD modeling code generation, improving reasoning, precision, and executability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD workflows demand expertise and manual effort, and translating human design intent into CAD code is challenging due to logical, syntactic, and numerical requirements.

Method: Combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards (executability, geometric accuracy, external evaluation) and optimization strategies (Trust Region Stretch, Precision Token Loss, Overlong Filtering).

Result: Significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability demonstrated on the ExeCAD dataset.

Conclusion: CAD-RL effectively automates CAD modeling code generation, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nested-ReFT introduces a computationally efficient ReFT framework by using a subset of model layers as a behavior model, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ReFT frameworks are computationally expensive due to multiple inference steps during training.

Method: Nested-ReFT leverages off-policy RL and speculative decoding, using a subset of layers as a behavior model with dynamic layer skipping to reduce costs.

Result: The method improves computational efficiency (tokens/sec) on math reasoning benchmarks and maintains baseline performance with bias mitigation.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT offers a cost-effective alternative to standard ReFT without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

*Yuhan Xie,William Cappelletti,Mahsa Shoaran,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy for time series models aligns with Neural Collapse theory, outperforming traditional methods on classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretext tasks for pre-training time series models are heuristic and lack guaranteed transferability to downstream tasks. The paper aims to address this by aligning pre-training with optimal embedding geometry.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised approach using a rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling, integrating generative pretext tasks and sequential augmentation to capture temporal dynamics.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models across three multivariate time series datasets.

Conclusion: Aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry improves performance, validating the proposed strategy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show

*Maria Stoica,Francesco Leofante,Alessio Lomuscio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-hoc OOD detection method using counterfactual explanations to measure distance to decision boundaries, improving scalability and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety of machine learning systems by providing accurate and explainable OOD detection.

Method: Leverages counterfactual explanations to calculate decision boundary distances, with scalability improvements by computing counterfactuals in embedding space.

Result: Achieves 93.50% AUROC and 25.80% FPR95 on CIFAR-10, outperforms on CIFAR-100 (97.05% AUROC, 13.79% FPR95) and ImageNet-200 (92.55% AUROC, 33.55% FPR95).

Conclusion: The method effectively combines accuracy, scalability, and interpretability for OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance across datasets.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95
across four OOD datasets

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the EM algorithm's behavior in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR), showing convergence rates and statistical accuracy under different initial mixing weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the EM algorithm's performance in model misspecification, particularly for overspecified 2MLR, addressing challenges like convergence rates and accuracy.

Method: Theoretical analysis of EM algorithm at population and finite-sample levels, focusing on regression parameters and mixing weights.

Result: Linear convergence for unbalanced initial weights, sublinear for balanced. Statistical accuracy varies with mixing weights: O((d/n)^(1/2)) for unbalanced, O((d/n)^(1/4)) for balanced.

Conclusion: The study connects population and finite-sample results, providing insights into EM's behavior in overspecified 2MLR and extending analysis to low SNR regimes.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the role of benchmarks in improving reasoning language models' performance, showing that impactful benchmarks act as curricula for learning, not just evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning language models generalize better through intermediate steps and the role of benchmarks in their learning process.

Method: Analyzes the impact of benchmarks on model performance, using DeepSeek-R1 and a sequential decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam.

Result: Demonstrates that performance improvements can stem from benchmark-driven learning, not just algorithmic or size enhancements.

Conclusion: Benchmarks should be viewed as training curricula, and novelty in test tasks is crucial for measuring generalization in reasoning models.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven approach using explainable ML to monitor dairy cattle health and behavior via IoT sensors, achieving high accuracy with the k-nearest neighbor classifier and SHAP for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in tracking cattle health and behavior on farms by leveraging modern ML and IoT technologies for sustainable livestock management.

Method: Uses 3-axis accelerometer data, Bluetooth IoT devices, and 4G networks for data collection. Applies signal processing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter-optimized ML models (e.g., k-nearest neighbor) for activity classification.

Result: The k-nearest neighbor classifier achieved high performance (AUC ~0.99) with SHAP providing interpretable feature importance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates practical, explainable ML models for sustainable livestock management, aiding farmers in decision-making.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-driven analysis of handwritten markings on seized ivory tusks provides a scalable, low-cost forensic tool to link trafficking networks, complementing DNA evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transnational ivory trade threatens elephant populations, but current forensic methods like DNA analysis are costly or unavailable. Handwritten markings on tusks, though easy to photograph, are underutilized.

Method: An AI pipeline was developed to extract and analyze handwritten markings from 6,085 photographs of seized tusks (2014-2019). Object detection and AI tools identified 17,000+ markings, with 184 recurring 'signature markings' linking tusks.

Result: 20 signature markings appeared in multiple seizures, connecting traffickers across shipments. This method fills gaps where DNA evidence is unavailable.

Conclusion: AI-based handwriting analysis offers a transformative, scalable tool for wildlife forensics, aiding efforts to disrupt organized ivory trafficking.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

### [227] [Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228)
*Abdelmoula El Yazizi,Samee U. Khan,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates D-Wave quantum annealer's sampling quality for RBMs using a local-valley approach, finding limited improvement over Gibbs sampling but potential for hybrid methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether quantum annealing (D-Wave) improves sampling quality in RBMs compared to classical Gibbs sampling, especially during contrastive-divergence-based learning.

Method: Compared D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a trained RBM, analyzing local-valley counts and energy minima under relevant conditions.

Result: D-Wave samples covered more local valleys but overlapped with Gibbs samples for high-probability states. Complementary potential exists for intermediate-probability states.

Conclusion: Quantum annealing shows limited standalone improvement but hints at promise for hybrid classical-quantum approaches in RBM training.

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable LightGBM model was developed for early AKI prediction in ICU cirrhosis patients, achieving high accuracy and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AKI in cirrhosis patients is common and worsens outcomes, but existing predictive tools lack accuracy and workflow alignment.

Method: Retrospective analysis of MIMIC-IV data, preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation of six ML algorithms.

Result: LightGBM performed best (AUROC 0.808, accuracy 0.704), identifying key predictors like prolonged PTT and low pH.

Conclusion: The model aids early AKI risk stratification, supports de-escalation for low-risk patients, and needs external validation.

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

*Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza,Aditya Tomar,Abein Abraham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context learning (ICL) for cryptographic function learning, focusing on substitution ciphers like mono-alphabetic and Vigenère, to evaluate transformer models' generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend ICL's application beyond simple function classes to structured cryptographic tasks, assessing transformers' ability to infer hidden mappings.

Method: Uses ICL with transformer models to learn and decode substitution ciphers from a few (cipher text, plain text) pairs.

Result: Demonstrates transformers' capability to infer and generalize over cryptographic functions under the ICL paradigm.

Conclusion: ICL is effective for structured cryptographic tasks, highlighting transformers' inductive biases and generalization potential.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

*Taibiao Zhao,Mingxuan Sun,Hao Wang,Xiaobing Chen,Xiangwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HPMI is a retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers, using head-wise pruning and malicious injection, achieving high attack success and bypassing defenses without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and existing methods are resource-intensive or intrusive. HPMI aims to provide a lightweight, non-intrusive solution.

Method: Prunes the least important head and injects a pre-trained malicious head without retraining, using minimal data and basic model knowledge.

Result: Achieves 99.55% attack success, negligible clean accuracy loss, and bypasses four advanced defenses.

Conclusion: HPMI is effective, concealable, and robust against defenses, outperforming retraining-dependent attacks.

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity in cloud-native database systems necessitate an adaptive solution.

Method: Proposes a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism with a reward-shaping mechanism to integrate local and global feedback, enhancing coordination and policy convergence.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in resource utilization, scheduling latency, convergence speed, stability, and fairness, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: The method is effective for large-scale, high-concurrency scheduling tasks, confirming its practical utility in real-world environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data privacy, heterogeneous behavior, and centralized modeling limitations in multi-tenant cloud environments.

Method: Federated training with local model training, parameter aggregation, personalized adjustment, and Mahalanobis distance for anomaly scoring.

Result: Outperforms existing models in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with stable performance in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Practical for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud computing.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for adapting to source component shifts in data streams by combining offline decomposition and online mixing, outperforming existing methods by reducing cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively utilize recurring shifts or capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation.

Method: The approach involves offline source component decomposition using the EM algorithm and online mixing weight adaptation via convex optimization.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces cumulative test loss by up to 67.4% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages shift characteristics, achieving superior adaptation performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

*Ricardo Diaz-Rincon,Muxuan Liang,Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora,Benjamin Shickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework for Parkinson's Disease medication management provides reliable, uncertainty-quantified predictions for levodopa dosing adjustments, improving clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PD medication management lacks systematic predictive methods, relying on trial-and-error, which risks inadequate symptom control or side effects due to unquantified uncertainty.

Method: Developed a two-stage conformal prediction framework using EHR data to predict medication needs and levodopa dose adjustments with reliable prediction intervals.

Result: Achieved marginal coverage and reduced prediction interval lengths, offering precise short-term and broader long-term forecasts for medication adjustments.

Conclusion: The framework enhances clinical trust by quantifying uncertainty, enabling optimized levodopa dosing to balance symptom control and side effects, improving patient quality of life.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

TL;DR: SynBrain is a generative framework for modeling the probabilistic and biologically interpretable transformation of visual stimuli to neural responses, outperforming existing methods in fMRI synthesis and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic methods fail to model biological variability and functional consistency in neural responses to visual stimuli.

Method: SynBrain uses BrainVAE for probabilistic neural representations and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper to project visual semantics into neural responses.

Result: SynBrain excels in subject-specific fMRI encoding, adapts to new subjects with minimal data, and improves fMRI-to-image decoding.

Conclusion: SynBrain captures functional consistency and biological variability, offering high-fidelity fMRI synthesis and interpretable neural patterns.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: FedKEI is a federated learning framework that uses cross-task knowledge transfer to quickly adapt to new healthcare tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving collaboration in healthcare while efficiently adapting to new tasks or diseases using large foundation models.

Method: FedKEI employs global clustering and bi-level optimization to personalize knowledge transfer via inter- and intra-cluster weights.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new diseases across dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT datasets.

Conclusion: FedKEI effectively leverages past knowledge for rapid adaptation in federated healthcare settings.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [238] [A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315)
*Keke Gai,Dongjue Wang,Jing Yu,Liehuang Zhu,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLIP-Fed is a Federated Learning backdoor defense framework using vision-language models to address heterogeneous data and privacy concerns, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL backdoor defenses assume homogeneous data or require clean server datasets, limiting practicality. CLIP-Fed aims to defend against attacks under heterogeneous data while preserving model performance.

Method: CLIP-Fed integrates pre- and post-aggregation defenses, uses multimodal large language models for dataset augmentation, and aligns global model knowledge with CLIP using prototype contrastive loss and KL divergence.

Result: CLIP-Fed reduces ASR by 2.03% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving MA by 7.92% and 0.48%, respectively.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed effectively defends against backdoor attacks in FL under heterogeneous data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

*Claire Jie Zhang,Seyed A. Esmaeili,Jamie Morgenstern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional fair clustering methods, proposing a welfare-centric approach with group utilities based on distance and representation. It introduces two optimization objectives (Rawlsian and Utilitarian) and algorithms, showing superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fair clustering methods may lead to undesirable outcomes, prompting a shift to welfare-centric approaches that better model group utilities.

Method: Proposes welfare-centric clustering with group utilities based on distance and proportional representation. Introduces novel algorithms for Rawlsian and Utilitarian objectives.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the methods outperform existing fair clustering baselines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The welfare-centric approach with group utilities and new algorithms offers improved fairness and performance in clustering.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

*Md Ashraf Uddin,Nam H. Chu,Reza Rafeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-level IoMT IDS framework is proposed to detect zero-day attacks and distinguish known/unknown threats, achieving high accuracy and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized IDSs are unsuitable for IoMT due to delays, privacy risks, and vulnerabilities. Resource constraints make local IDSs infeasible.

Method: A multi-level framework: near Edge filters traffic coarsely (meta-learning/OCC), far Edge/Cloud identifies attack type/novelty.

Result: 99.77% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score on CICIoMT2024 dataset; first layer detects zero-day attacks effectively.

Conclusion: The framework ensures strong applicability in IoMT, addressing vulnerabilities without needing new datasets.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

*Samer Lahoud,Kinda Khawam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores distribution learning in semantic communication, establishing conditions for learning source statistics and revealing a trade-off between immediate performance and long-term learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how receivers can infer meaning distributions in semantic communication when priors are unknown, and to balance immediate performance with adaptation.

Method: Theoretical analysis of learnability conditions, convergence rates, and semantic distortion, validated with experiments on CIFAR-10.

Result: Learnability requires full rank of the transmission matrix; experiments show system conditioning impacts learning rate and performance.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous framework for statistical learning in semantic communication, offering design principles for adaptable systems.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

*Jiyong Kim,Jaeho Lee,Jiahao Lin,Alish Kanani,Miao Sun,Umit Y. Ogras,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: eMamba is a hardware acceleration framework for Mamba models on edge devices, offering efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of optimized hardware acceleration for Mamba models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Replaces complex layers with lightweight alternatives, approximates expensive operations, and uses approximation-aware NAS.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy with fewer parameters, lower latency, higher throughput, and reduced power/energy consumption.

Conclusion: eMamba is efficient and effective for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms.

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

*Liyun Zhang,Jingcheng Ke,Shenli Fan,Xuanmeng Sha,Zheng Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified evaluation framework for Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) with two novel metrics: DIC and BAE, to assess annotator tendency capture and behavioral explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ITL methods lack a framework to evaluate if they truly capture annotator tendencies and provide meaningful explanations.

Method: Introduces two metrics: Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) and Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE), using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for alignment.

Result: Experiments validate the framework's effectiveness in evaluating ITL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework fills a critical gap in assessing ITL methods for annotator tendency and behavioral explanation quality.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XQuant reduces memory consumption for LLM inference by quantizing and caching layer input activations, achieving up to 10x memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient LLM inference is challenging due to high memory demands and bandwidth limitations, exacerbated by modern GPU hardware trends.

Method: XQuant quantizes and caches layer input activations (X) instead of KV caching, rematerializing Keys and Values on-the-fly. XQuant-CL further exploits cross-layer similarity for extreme compression.

Result: XQuant achieves up to 7.7x memory savings with <0.1 perplexity degradation; XQuant-CL attains 10x savings with 0.01 degradation and 12.5x with 0.1 degradation.

Conclusion: XQuant leverages increasing compute capabilities to surpass state-of-the-art KV cache quantization, achieving near-FP16 accuracy while eliminating memory bottlenecks.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SC2Arena, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs in StarCraft II, and StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework for strategic planning and tactical execution, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for StarCraft II lack full complexity, such as complete game context and diverse action spaces, limiting AI's strategic planning and real-time adaptation capabilities.

Method: SC2Arena supports all playable races and low-level action spaces, while StarEvolve uses a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure and iterative self-correction for continuous improvement.

Result: StarEvolve outperforms in strategic planning, and SC2Arena enables insights into developing generalist agents.

Conclusion: The proposed tools advance AI's strategic decision-making in complex environments like StarCraft II.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM's implicit regularization in tensorized models is analyzed, introducing Norm Deviation and proposing DAS for improved performance with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand SAM's behavior in general tensorized models and leverage scale-invariance for better optimization.

Method: Analyze norm dynamics of SAM, introduce Norm Deviation, and propose Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS).

Result: DAS matches or outperforms SAM in tasks like tensor completion and model compression, with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: DAS effectively mimics SAM's regularization, offering a simpler and more efficient alternative.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC is a framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations by preserving inter-feature dependencies and allowing user constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods lack realism, feasibility, and user adaptability due to rigid constraints and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: RealAC aligns joint feature distributions between factual and counterfactual instances and allows users to freeze attributes.

Result: RealAC outperforms baselines in realism, causality, and dependency preservation metrics.

Conclusion: RealAC provides a causality-aware, user-centric solution for counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Node is a self-explaining GNN framework that generates per-node explanations during predictions, maintaining accuracy while improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs lack interpretability in high-stakes applications; existing explainability methods are post-hoc and global, failing to provide local insights.

Method: X-Node constructs structured context vectors for each node, uses a Reasoner module to generate explanations, and integrates these into the GNN pipeline.

Result: X-Node achieves competitive classification accuracy on MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST datasets while providing faithful per-node explanations.

Conclusion: X-Node enhances GNN interpretability without sacrificing performance, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG is a federated graph learning framework addressing class imbalance by using a hierarchical GAN for data augmentation and mutual information-guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in federated graph learning (FGL) biases models toward majority classes, impairing performance on rare events.

Method: Proposes GraphFedMIG, a hierarchical GAN framework where clients train local generators, grouped into clusters with shared discriminators, and uses mutual information to guide generation.

Result: Outperforms baselines on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG effectively mitigates class imbalance in FGL by focusing on high-value minority-class features.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT is a framework for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that eliminates calibration by combining population-level pretraining and continual online finetuning, improving accuracy and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs face accuracy degradation due to neural signal drift and user variability, requiring frequent recalibration, which hinders practical deployment.

Method: EDAPT trains a baseline decoder on multi-user data, then continually personalizes it via supervised finetuning as neural patterns evolve. It also uses unsupervised domain adaptation for further gains.

Result: EDAPT improved accuracy over static methods across nine datasets and three BCI tasks, with efficient updates (200ms) on consumer hardware. Accuracy scales with total data budget, not its allocation.

Conclusion: EDAPT offers a practical, calibration-free solution for BCIs, reducing deployment barriers.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

*Alexander Merkov,David Rohde,Alexandre Gilotte,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights how common practices in recommender systems can introduce unobserved confounding, similar to issues in observational studies, and provides solutions to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unobserved confounding biases causal effect estimates, affecting fields like economics and medicine. While recommender systems seem immune, certain practices (e.g., feature engineering, A/B testing) can introduce confounding, harming performance.

Method: The paper uses simulation studies to illustrate how standard practices in recommender systems create confounding and offers practical suggestions to address it.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that practices like feature engineering and A/B testing can introduce confounding, degrading system performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners should be aware of and mitigate confounding in recommender systems by following provided practical suggestions.

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using neural ODEs and JEPAs to create structured latent state-space models from observation data, demonstrated on a pendulum system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon reconstruction-based methods by leveraging JEPAs for more capable world models.

Method: Integrates sequence embeddings with neural ODEs, enforcing contractive embeddings and Lipschitz constants for a well-organized latent state space.

Result: Successfully generates structured latent state-space models for a pendulum system using only image data.

Conclusion: The technique offers a promising approach for developing general control algorithms and estimation methods in robotics.

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral framework is introduced to analyze smoothness and faithfulness in explanations of ReLU networks, addressing noisy gradient-based interpretations and the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU networks' reliance on individual pixels for predictions leads to noisy and hard-to-interpret gradient-based explanations, while existing methods like GradCAM sacrifice faithfulness for smoothness.

Method: The paper introduces a spectral framework to analyze and quantify smoothness and faithfulness in explanations, regularizing high-frequency contributions of ReLU networks.

Result: The framework identifies an "explanation gap" caused by surrogate-based smoothing and validates findings across datasets and design choices.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a principled approach to balancing smoothness and faithfulness in explanations, improving interpretability of ReLU networks.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

*Che-Yu Chou,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces automated codebook learning models for multiclass classification using ECOC, outperforming traditional methods in robustness to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECOC methods rely on manual or random codebooks, which are inefficient and may not adapt well to datasets. The paper aims to automate and optimize this process.

Method: Three models based on contrastive learning are proposed to learn codebooks directly and adaptively from data.

Result: The models show superior robustness to adversarial attacks compared to baselines across four datasets.

Conclusion: Automated codebook learning via contrastive learning improves ECOC performance, offering a more efficient and adaptive solution for multiclass classification.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

*Jiulin Li,Ping Huang,Yexin Li,Shuo Chen,Juewen Hu,Ye Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS is a modular framework unifying multimodal understanding and generation via decoupled Cognition and Deliberation phases, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of integrating autoregressive LLMs for reasoning and diffusion models for generation in multimodal applications.

Method: Uses symbolic multi-agent collaboration (Perceiver, Planner, Reflector) in Cognition phase and Growth-Aware Search in Deliberation phase.

Result: Outperforms baselines and GPT-4o on benchmarks like MME, supporting any-to-any modality conversion.

Conclusion: MAGUS offers flexible, scalable multimodal integration without joint training, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

*Dmitrii Dobrynin,Masoud Mohseni,John Paul Strachan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning to train nonlocal transition policies for Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms, improving performance on hard combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MCMC methods struggle with hard benchmarks near computational phase transitions due to rigid variables and suboptimal basins. NMC with inhomogeneous temperature profiles was proposed to address this, but its transition policies were previously designed phenomenologically.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is used to train NMC's nonlocal transition policies, using energy changes as rewards and local minimum energy landscape geometry as states.

Result: The trained policies outperform standard MCMC and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard 4-SAT benchmarks in residual energy, time-to-solution, and solution diversity.

Conclusion: Deep RL-trained NMC policies effectively enhance exploration and exploitation in combinatorial optimization, offering superior performance on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

*Hao Luan,Yi Xian Goh,See-Kiong Ng,Chun Kai Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCD is a test-time framework for joint generation using coupled diffusion models, enforcing constraints without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with jointly correlated samples and task-specific constraints without costly retraining.

Method: PCD introduces coupled guidance and projection steps to coordinate diffusion models and enforce constraints.

Result: PCD improves coupling effects and guarantees constraint satisfaction in tasks like image-pair generation and motion planning.

Conclusion: PCD effectively addresses joint generation challenges without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

TL;DR: Applm, a framework using the xTrimoPGLM protein language model, outperforms existing methods in identifying allergens, including novel ones and those with high sequence similarity to non-allergens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Allergens pose a public health challenge, and accurate identification is needed to address it.

Method: Applm leverages the 100-billion parameter xTrimoPGLM model to predict allergens, tested in diverse real-world scenarios.

Result: Applm consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in tasks like identifying novel allergens and differentiating homologs.

Conclusion: xTrimoPGLM's general protein sequence understanding is key to Applm's success, and the framework is open-source for future research.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yuhuai Qin,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA) to address reward sparsity and misalignment in long-horizon RL, particularly for software engineering tasks, improving completion and modification rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward shaping methods struggle with bias or misalignment in long-horizon RL tasks, especially in software engineering where multi-turn reasoning is critical.

Method: Proposes the SWE-oriented RL Framework and G-RA, which accumulates immediate rewards only when long-term rewards meet a threshold.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in completion rates (47.6% to 93.8%) and modification rates (19.6% to 23.8%).

Conclusion: G-RA effectively balances reward accumulation, avoiding policy degradation and providing a practical solution for long-horizon RL.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

TL;DR: CATE-B is an open-source co-pilot system using LLMs to simplify treatment effect estimation by guiding users through causal modeling, adjustment set identification, and method selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of causal inference techniques limits their adoption despite their importance in fields like healthcare and economics.

Method: CATE-B integrates LLMs for causal discovery, adjustment set identification, and regression method selection, supported by benchmark tasks.

Result: The system lowers barriers to rigorous causal analysis and introduces a new benchmark for automated TE estimation.

Conclusion: CATE-B advances causal inference accessibility and reproducibility, paving the way for future benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

TL;DR: Unified learning uses graph representations and a GNN to train heterogeneous models coherently, improving generalizability across medical imaging datasets with distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of maintaining generalizability in medical imaging under domain-fracture scenarios with varying data distributions and model architectures.

Method: Propose unified learning, encoding models into a graph representation and optimizing them with a unified GNN (uGNN) for parameter sharing and knowledge transfer.

Result: Unified learning improves performance on MorphoMNIST and MedMNIST benchmarks, showing robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Unified learning is effective for training heterogeneous models across diverse medical imaging datasets, enhancing generalizability.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

TL;DR: A new method using Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) is introduced to address upsampling challenges in energy networks, reducing RMSE by 9% and improving MPC accuracy by 13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional upsampling methods and advanced models (like generative, Super-Resolution, and imputation models) in energy network design, which suffer from information loss, noise, or dependency on unavailable high-resolution data.

Method: The paper proposes Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), trained without ground-truth high-resolution data, to upsample time series while preserving statistical characteristics.

Result: The method reduces RMSE by 9% in upsampling tasks and improves MPC accuracy by 13% compared to conventional interpolation.

Conclusion: GATs offer a promising solution for upsampling in energy networks, addressing key challenges of existing methods without requiring high-resolution training data.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based GAD methods have high deployment costs and poor scalability due to complex training. Empirical findings suggest training may not significantly improve performance.

Method: FreeGAD employs an affinity-gated residual encoder for anomaly-aware representations and uses anchor nodes to guide statistical deviation calculations for anomaly scores.

Result: FreeGAD outperforms existing methods in performance, efficiency, and scalability across multiple benchmark datasets without training.

Conclusion: FreeGAD demonstrates that training-free approaches can be highly effective for GAD, offering a practical alternative to resource-intensive deep learning methods.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Motivation: To address reliability issues in deep network explanations by providing a formal analysis framework.

Method: Adopts probabilistic and spectral perspectives to analyze explanation methods, identifying biases and proposing remedies like SpectralLens.

Result: Reveals spectral bias in gradient-based methods, introduces standard perturbation scale and SpectralLens for consistent explanations.

Conclusion: Formal analysis improves reliability of deep network explanations, with proposed solutions validated theoretically and quantitatively.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes variance-reduction techniques to improve sample efficiency in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) using policy gradient methods, addressing the challenge of high data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MORL optimizes multiple conflicting objectives, but existing policy gradient methods suffer from high sample inefficiency, limiting their practicality.

Method: The authors implement variance-reduction techniques to reduce sample complexity while maintaining scalability and general assumptions.

Result: The approach aims to enhance the efficiency of policy gradient methods in MORL without sacrificing their benefits for large state-action spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more practical solution for MORL by improving sample efficiency and retaining scalability.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy

*Lucas Cardoso,Vitor Santos,José Ribeiro Filho,Ricardo Prudêncio,Regiane Kawasaki,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Item Response Theory (IRT) to improve dataset partitioning for ML model validation, revealing inherent data heterogeneity and improving model performance insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data partitioning ignores instance quality, leading to suboptimal validation. IRT can address this by characterizing data heterogeneity.

Method: IRT parameters guide dataset partitioning. Impact on ML model performance is evaluated across four tabular datasets.

Result: IRT reveals data heterogeneity and improves understanding of bias-variance tradeoff. High-guessing instances negatively impact model performance.

Conclusion: IRT-informed partitioning enhances ML validation by identifying informative subgroups and balancing bias-variance tradeoffs.

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

*Patrick Soga,Zhenyu Lei,Yinhan He,Camille Bilodeau,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for predicting binding free energy changes ($\Delta\Delta G$) in protein engineering avoids intractable conformational distribution estimation by decomposing $\Delta\Delta G$ into sequence-based and structure-based components, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting $\Delta\Delta G$ is crucial for protein and PPI engineering in drug discovery, but current methods struggle with estimating full conformational distributions.

Method: The approach decomposes $\Delta\Delta G$ into sequence-based (inverse folding model) and structure-based (energy model) components, assuming equilibrium between bound and unbound states.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and SARS-CoV-2 antibody optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition and energy-based inductive bias provide a more tractable and accurate solution for $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

*Yihua Wang,Qi Jia,Cong Xu,Feiyu Chen,Yuhan Liu,Haotian Zhang,Liang Jin,Lu Liu,Zhichun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcut learning in multimodal sarcasm detection, introduces MUStARD++$^{R}$ to remove shortcuts, and proposes MCIB for effective fusion, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut learning in datasets impairs generalization, and current fusion strategies are ineffective for sarcasm detection.

Method: Construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcuts; introduce MCIB for efficient multimodal fusion.

Result: MCIB achieves top performance without relying on shortcuts.

Conclusion: Effective modality fusion is crucial for sarcasm detection, and MCIB provides a robust solution.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

*Chenkai Guo,Yikai Zhu,Jing Yangum,Renxiang Guan,Por Lip Yee,Guangdun Peng,Dayu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHENIC improves spatial-transcriptomics clustering by integrating topological features and optimizing spatial embeddings, outperforming existing methods by 3.31%-6.54%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial-transcriptomics clustering are limited by noisy topological signals and poor spatial neighborhood modeling.

Method: SPHENIC uses persistent homology for stable representation learning and a Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM) for high-quality spatial embeddings.

Result: SPHENIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% on 14 benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SPHENIC effectively addresses limitations in spatial clustering, offering superior performance and robust embeddings.

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

*Debvrat Varshney,Vibhas Vats,Bhartendu Pandey,Christa Brelsford,Philipe Dias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Generative AI (GenAI) for forecasting land-use and land-cover change (LULC), demonstrating its feasibility with a diffusion model for imperviousness forecasting in the U.S.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LULC forecasting lags behind other Earth system models, limiting risk and consequence assessments for future scenarios.

Method: Frames LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem using historical and auxiliary data, employing a diffusion model for decadal imperviousness forecasting.

Result: The model outperforms a no-change baseline for resolutions ≥ 0.7×0.7 km², showing it captures significant spatiotemporal patterns.

Conclusion: The approach is promising, with future research aimed at integrating Earth's physical properties and scenario simulations via driver variables.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a graph classification approach that combines the expressive power of Weisfeiler-Leman variants with the efficiency of tabular data methods.

Method: Tabularize graph data using Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm variants, then apply tabular data methods. Theoretical analysis of expressive power and empirical testing on benchmark datasets.

Result: Matches accuracy of graph neural networks and kernels, with better time or memory efficiency. Interpretable modal logic formulas can also be extracted.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, efficient, and offers interpretability, making it a viable alternative to existing graph classification methods.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for graph classification based on tabularizing
graph data via variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then applying
methods for tabular data. We investigate a comprehensive class of
Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical
framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their
expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDNS, a framework for training neural samplers to generate samples from complex discrete state spaces, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning to sample from high-dimensional, multi-modal discrete distributions is challenging but crucial in fields like statistical physics and machine learning.

Method: MDNS aligns path measures using stochastic optimal control of Markov chains, enabling efficient sampling.

Result: MDNS outperforms baselines in accuracy and scalability across diverse distributions.

Conclusion: MDNS is a robust and scalable solution for sampling from complex discrete distributions.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

*Tianlong Yu,Lihong Liu,Ziyi Zhou,Fudu Xing,Kailong Wang,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFN uses reinforcement learning to train LLMs for generating network filters, addressing scalability, compatibility, and robustness in preventing 1-day or n-day vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses like patching and filtering are inadequate due to scalability, compatibility, and deployment issues.

Method: REFN employs RL-driven LLMs, online network rewards, edge gateway deployment, and online validation to generate and validate filters.

Result: REFN achieves 21.1% higher accuracy, 3.65-hour Mean Time To Patch, and scales to 10K devices.

Conclusion: REFN is a promising step toward using LLMs for rapid, large-scale exploit prevention.

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-powered antenna simulation framework using open-source EM software (gprMax) for machine learning, comparing it with commercial tools and evaluating performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning in antenna design requires large datasets, but EM simulations are computationally expensive. GPUs offer a solution to generate sufficient training data efficiently.

Method: The study uses GPUs to simulate numerous antennas with predefined or random parameters, creating datasets for machine learning. It compares GPU vs. CPU performance and evaluates various ML/DL models for antenna parameter estimation.

Result: An entry-level GPU outperforms a high-end CPU, and a gaming GPU achieves ~18x better performance. Open-source gprMax matches commercial software results for microstrip antennas with fine spatial resolution.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration enables efficient large-scale antenna simulations for ML, with open-source tools providing comparable accuracy to commercial software under specific conditions.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

TL;DR: Proposes APFL, a dual-stream least squares method for Personalized Federated Learning, addressing non-IID data challenges with global and local streams for generalization and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods struggle with non-IID data, hindering generalization and personalization.

Method: Uses a frozen backbone for feature extraction, dual-stream models (shared primary for global generalization, refinement for local personalization).

Result: Achieves heterogeneity invariance, outperforms baselines by 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Conclusion: APFL effectively addresses non-IID data issues in PFL, offering robust generalization and personalization.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Pass@k as a reward in RLVR to improve exploration, showing it balances exploration and exploitation without conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of conservative actions and local optima in RLVR by investigating Pass@k's role in enhancing exploration.

Method: Train policy models using Pass@k as reward, derive an analytical solution for its advantage, and analyze the interplay of exploration and exploitation.

Result: Pass@k Training improves exploration, and exploration/exploitation can mutually enhance each other. Analytical derivation simplifies advantage function design.

Conclusion: Pass@k Training offers a promising direction for RLVR, with potential for further advantage function design.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Conclusion: Erwin NSA effectively addresses quadratic attention scaling, enhancing transformer efficiency for large physical systems.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention

TL;DR: IBEX is a coarse-to-fine pipeline for drug discovery, improving transfer learning and docking success rates by leveraging information-bottleneck theory and physics-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of protein-ligand complex data and overcoming overfitting in generative models for drug discovery.

Method: Uses PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify sample information density, retains TargetDiff architecture, and applies L-BFGS optimization for refinement.

Result: Increases docking success rate from 53% to 64%, improves Vina score, achieves best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets, and enhances QED by 25%.

Conclusion: IBEX significantly advances structure-based drug design by improving generalization, docking performance, and molecular quality.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in GNN-based GAD is underexplored, and existing methods focus on node classification, not autoencoder-based anomaly detection.

Method: Uses a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes and designs a fairness-guided loss function with a specialized autoencoder.

Result: Achieves competitive anomaly detection performance and significantly improves fairness metrics on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD effectively balances fairness and performance in GAD, filling a gap in current research.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm (rmab) for non-stationary RMABs, combining sliding window RL and UCB to handle dynamic transitions, achieving a theoretical regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications (e.g., healthcare, recommendations) often involve non-stationary dynamics, breaking traditional RMAB assumptions.

Method: The rmab algorithm integrates sliding window RL with UCB to learn and adapt to non-stationary transitions.

Result: The algorithm achieves a regret bound of O~(N² B^(1/4) T^(3/4)), providing a theoretical foundation for non-stationary RMABs.

Conclusion: The work offers a novel solution and theoretical framework for non-stationary RMABs, addressing real-world challenges.

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational limitations of GPs in streaming scenarios by evaluating and comparing datapoint reduction methods.

Result: Provides insights into the computational complexity and reduction behavior of criteria, with practical recommendations.

Conclusion: Offers guidelines for selecting reduction criteria in Online GPs to balance efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

### [284] [Memory-Augmented Transformers: A Systematic Review from Neuroscience Principles to Technical Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10824)
*Parsa Omidi,Xingshuai Huang,Axel Laborieux,Bahareh Nikpour,Tianyu Shi,Armaghan Eshaghi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A review of Memory-Augmented Transformers, bridging neuroscience and engineering to address limitations in long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration. The paper aims to unify neuroscience principles with engineering advances to overcome these limitations.

Method: The review organizes progress through three dimensions: functional objectives, memory representations, and integration mechanisms. It analyzes core memory operations like reading, writing, and forgetting.

Result: Reveals a shift toward adaptive, test-time learning systems and identifies solutions like hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates.

Conclusion: Provides a roadmap for developing cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures, addressing scalability and interference challenges.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

*Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Kimberly Mai,Prakhar Ganesh,Martin Vechev,Ferdinando Fioretto,Matthew Jagielski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML) to unify fragmented research and aid practitioners in applying DM principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data minimization (DM) is a key principle in data protection regulations, but its application in ML is fragmented, causing confusion among practitioners.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive DMML framework, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and minimization points, and review DM-adjacent literature.

Result: The framework provides a structured overview, enabling systematic application of DM principles in ML.

Conclusion: The work promotes unified understanding and adoption of DM strategies in AI/ML.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

### [286] [Efficiently Verifiable Proofs of Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10866)
*Ari Karchmer,Seth Neel,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interactive verification protocol for data attribution in ML models, ensuring trust and efficiency for resource-constrained parties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trust issue in data attribution due to high computational costs, which limits access for resource-constrained parties.

Method: An interactive proof system between a Prover (computationally powerful) and a Verifier (resource-constrained), ensuring PAC verification guarantees.

Result: A protocol providing formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency, with Verifier workload scaling independently of dataset size.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables trustworthy and efficient verification of data attributions, applicable to various attribution tasks.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

*Haydn Thomas Jones,Natalie Maus,Josh Magnus Ludan,Maggie Ziyu Huan,Jiaming Liang,Marcelo Der Torossian Torres,Jiatao Liang,Zachary Ives,Yoseph Barash,Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez,Jacob R. Gardner,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset of priors for AI-driven therapeutic design, improving model performance and safety by leveraging literature-derived constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven discovery can enhance therapeutics but risks violating implicit constraints due to lack of experimental priors, leading to unsafe proposals.

Method: The authors create a dataset (32.3M pairs of facts and entity representations) using LLM pipelines, then train models (LLM, CLIP, LLava) to reason about text and design targets.

Result: Models pretrained with the dataset outperform larger models on TDC tasks and generate safer, effective molecules in GuacaMol.

Conclusion: The dataset enables safer and more effective AI-driven therapeutic design, with potential for expansion as literature grows.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

TL;DR: zERExtractor is an automated platform for extracting enzyme kinetics data from literature, outperforming baselines in accuracy and enabling AI-driven modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of enzyme kinetics literature has overwhelmed database curation, hindering AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery.

Method: zERExtractor uses a modular pipeline with domain-adapted deep learning, OCR, semantic entity recognition, and LLMs, supported by human expert corrections and active learning.

Result: The system achieves high accuracy in table recognition (89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up to 99.1%), and relation extraction (94.2%).

Conclusion: zERExtractor addresses the enzyme kinetics data gap with a flexible, high-fidelity framework, supporting future AI-powered biochemical research.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of enzyme kinetics literature has outpaced the curation
capabilities of major biochemical databases, creating a substantial barrier to
AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery. We present zERExtractor, an
automated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of
enzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature.
zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports
plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language
models (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system
evolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep
learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM
modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters
(e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions,
and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active
learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and
iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also
release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and
5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications.
Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing
baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up
to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the
longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready
framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future
AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.

*Qihua Pan,Dong Xu,Jenna Xinyi Yao,Lijia Ma,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: FROGENT is an AI-driven agent integrating diverse drug discovery tools via a Large Language Model, significantly outperforming existing methods in benchmarks and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented AI tools in drug discovery create inefficiencies; FROGENT aims to unify these tools for streamlined workflows.

Method: Uses a Large Language Model and Model Context Protocol to integrate databases, tool libraries, and AI models for dynamic workflows.

Result: Triples baseline performance in hit-finding, doubles in interaction profiling, and surpasses GPT-4o and Qwen3-32B.

Conclusion: FROGENT enhances researcher productivity by unifying and automating drug discovery processes.

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,
named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large
Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Wav2Vec2 variants for age and gender classification in children's speech, finding early layers capture speaker traits better. PCA improves results, with top models achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children's speech variability challenges classification. SSL models' effectiveness for encoding speaker traits in kids is underexplored.

Method: Layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants on PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets, using PCA for feature refinement.

Result: Early layers (1-7) excel in capturing speaker traits. Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR.

Conclusion: Speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth, enabling adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due
to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their
ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the
PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture
speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly
focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,
reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The
Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU
Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These
results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and
support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

*Xiaohan Chen,Zhongying Pan,Quan Feng,Yu Tian,Shuqun Yang,Mengru Wang,Lina Gong,Yuxia Geng,Piji Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Saracoder introduces a hierarchical feature-optimized retrieval framework for repository-level code completion, addressing semantic misguidance and redundancy by refining candidates through deep semantic relationships and structural similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for code completion rely on superficial text similarity, leading to issues like semantic misguidance, redundancy, and unresolved external symbol ambiguity.

Method: Saracoder uses a Hierarchical Feature Optimization module to refine candidates by analyzing semantic relationships, pruning duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a graph-based metric, and reranking for relevance and diversity. It also includes an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator for cross-file symbol resolution.

Result: Saracoder outperforms existing baselines on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks across multiple languages and models.

Conclusion: Systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions improves accuracy and robustness in repository-level code completion.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

*Ruofan Lu,Yintong Huo,Meng Zhang,Yichen Li,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Next Edit Prediction, a task to predict developers' next code edits by analyzing interaction history, aiming to improve AI-powered coding assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI coding assistants either offer low-latency code completion or chat-based editing, both of which disrupt workflow. The goal is to proactively predict edits for a seamless experience.

Method: The authors curate a dataset and benchmark for Next Edit Prediction, fine-tune models, and evaluate them against baselines.

Result: The study yields novel findings on model performance, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting next edits.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for proactive AI collaboration in coding, anticipating developer actions instead of reacting to instructions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

TL;DR: A novel multi-task learning model for personalized product search ranking integrates tabular and non-tabular data, using TinyBERT embeddings and a new sampling technique, outperforming baselines like XGBoost and TabNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance personalized product search ranking by effectively combining diverse data types and leveraging advanced embedding techniques.

Method: Uses a multi-task learning framework with TinyBERT for semantic embeddings, a novel sampling technique, and a scalable relevance labeling mechanism based on click data.

Result: The model outperforms baselines, showing significant improvement in personalized ranking, with ablation studies confirming the value of relevance labels and TinyBERT fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves personalized product search ranking by integrating diverse data and advanced embeddings in a multi-task learning setup.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

TL;DR: The paper compares optimizing product recommendations for CTR vs. OSR in e-commerce, finding OSR yields 5x higher GMV uplift without harming new product discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether optimizing for CTR or OSR (linked to business goals like GMV) is more effective for e-commerce product recommendations.

Method: Conducted an online A/B test comparing CTR and OSR optimization, analyzing their impact on GMV and feature importance.

Result: Optimizing for OSR produced a GMV uplift over 5x larger than CTR, with no negative impact on new product discovery.

Conclusion: OSR optimization is more effective for business goals like GMV compared to CTR, offering valuable insights into feature importance.

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate
(CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and
Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in
e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training
data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large
quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a
generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more
directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value
(GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these
objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate
that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five
times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product
discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature
importances for each of the objectives.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CrossDenoise is a lightweight framework for denoising implicit feedback in recommender systems by disentangling noise into user-, item-, and interaction-specific factors, outperforming baselines with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit feedback in recommender systems is noisy, degrading accuracy. Existing methods lack entity-aware modeling, are computationally heavy, or require excessive tuning.

Method: CrossDenoise disentangles noise into user, item, and interaction factors, using entity reputation (user/item reliability) and interaction-level weights derived from empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with NeuMF, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy samples, is robust, and offers a practical, scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently
noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation
accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,
suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter
tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a
novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by
disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific
factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity
in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation
factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average
training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an
empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This
design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two
intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and
Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that
CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with
NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our
analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy
samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a
practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific jargon hinders interdisciplinary communication, and current jargon-management strategies are limited.

Method: Conducted a diary study with 16 professionals, designed ParseJargon, and tested it in controlled and field studies.

Result: Personalized jargon support improved comprehension and engagement, while general-purpose support had negative effects.

Conclusion: ParseJargon shows promise for real-world use, with implications for interdisciplinary and educational tools.

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time
meetings, highlighting both opportunities and limitations for real-world
deployment. Our findings contribute insights into designing personalized jargon
support tools, with implications for broader interdisciplinary and educational
applications.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for longitudinal studies in UIST research due to evolving user-AI interactions, proposing a workshop to address challenges and foster community.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User interactions with AI change over time, making one-time evaluations inadequate. Longitudinal studies are needed but face deployment and data collection challenges.

Method: The workshop includes keynote talks, panel discussions, and interactive sessions for protocol design and tool prototyping.

Result: The workshop aims to equip researchers with strategies for longitudinal studies and build a community around this approach.

Conclusion: Longitudinal research should be embraced for designing, building, and evaluating UIST tools.

Abstract: UIST researchers develop tools to address user challenges. However, user
interactions with AI evolve over time through learning, adaptation, and
repurposing, making one time evaluations insufficient. Capturing these dynamics
requires longer-term studies, but challenges in deployment, evaluation design,
and data collection have made such longitudinal research difficult to
implement. Our workshop aims to tackle these challenges and prepare researchers
with practical strategies for longitudinal studies. The workshop includes a
keynote, panel discussions, and interactive breakout groups for discussion and
hands-on protocol design and tool prototyping sessions. We seek to foster a
community around longitudinal system research and promote it as a more embraced
method for designing, building, and evaluating UIST tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generalized state estimation for closed-loop neuromodulation therapy without patient-specific training.

Method: Training a foundation model on longitudinal deep brain stimulation recordings with a 30-minute context window and an optimized pre-training loss function to address frequency bias.

Result: Successful decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, demonstrating generalization without patient-specific training.

Conclusion: The foundation model offers a scalable approach for personalized neuromodulation therapy by leveraging pre-trained models and correcting for electrophysiological data biases.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable
patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy. Recent advances in
pre-trained large-scale foundation models offer the potential for generalized
state estimation without patient-individual training. Here we present a
foundation model trained on chronic longitudinal deep brain stimulation
recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom
fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We
present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological
data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss
functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the
decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation without patient-individual training.

### [299] [MCP2OSC: Parametric Control by Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10414)
*Yuan-Yi Fan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCP2OSC, a system combining natural language prompts with precise OSC controls, bridging the gap between intuitive text prompts and complex knob adjustments. It leverages LLMs for OSC message generation and management, enhancing human-machine collaboration in multimedia control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between the simplicity of text prompts and the precision of knob controls in intricate tasks, particularly in OSC development.

Method: Developed the MCP server and prompt design criteria, integrating Claude (an LLM) with MCP2OSC to generate, interpret, and manage OSC messages via natural language. Demonstrated with 14 QA examples and templates.

Result: MCP2OSC effectively handles OSC message generation, interpretation, validation, and address pattern management, offering flexible precision controls through an intuitive language interface.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel LLM-based approach for OSC control, suggesting potential for universal multimedia device control mechanisms.

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine
collaboration by leveraging LLM (Large Language Model) to handle intricate OSC
development tasks, and by empowering human creativity with an intuitive
language interface featuring flexible precision controls: a prompt-based OSC
tool. This study provides a novel perspective on the creative MCP application
at the network protocol level by utilizing LLM's strength in directly
processing and generating human-readable OSC messages. The results suggest its
potential for a LLM-based universal control mechanism for multimedia devices.

*Andrea Gargano,Jasin Machkour,Mimma Nardelli,Enzo Pasquale Scilingo,Michael Muma*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study identifies reproducible physiological features linked to arousal levels, emphasizing rigorous reproducibility in Affective Computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of linking subjective emotional experiences with objective physiological markers reliably.

Method: Analyzed 164 features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals using the T-Rex method for feature selection.

Result: Only two electrodermal-derived features showed reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal.

Conclusion: Rigorous reproducibility assessments are crucial in physiological feature selection, especially for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

*Viktor Zaverkin,Matheus Ferraz,Francesco Alesiani,Mathias Niepert*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates machine-learned potentials for biomolecular simulations, finding that model size and training data composition affect accuracy, but long-range electrostatics have inconsistent impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials in biomolecular simulations, addressing gaps in current research.

Method: Systematic evaluation of equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset, with and without long-range dispersion and electrostatics, tested across various systems.

Result: Larger models improve benchmark accuracy but not simulation properties; training data composition affects predictions; long-range electrostatics inconsistently impact systems.

Conclusion: Imbalanced datasets and evaluation practices currently limit the effectiveness of universal machine-learned potentials for biomolecular simulations.

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

### [302] [Legal Zero-Days: A Novel Risk Vector for Advanced AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10050)
*Greg Sadler,Nathan Sherburn*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Legal Zero-Days'—unexplored legal vulnerabilities that can disrupt society when exploited. It proposes a risk model, uses a case study, and develops a methodology to assess AI systems' ability to find such vulnerabilities. Findings indicate current AI may not reliably detect them, but future systems could, posing risks and opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight unexplored legal vulnerabilities ('Legal Zero-Days') that could disrupt society and assess AI's role in identifying them.

Method: Proposes a risk model, uses the 2017 Australian dual citizenship crisis as a case study, and develops 'legal puzzles' to evaluate AI systems.

Result: Current AI models may not reliably find impactful Legal Zero-Days, but future systems could, presenting risks and opportunities.

Conclusion: The work identifies and mitigates unrecognized risks from frontier AI systems, emphasizing the need for legal robustness.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of "Legal Zero-Days" as a novel risk vector for
advanced AI systems. Legal Zero-Days are previously undiscovered
vulnerabilities in legal frameworks that, when exploited, can cause immediate
and significant societal disruption without requiring litigation or other
processes before impact. We present a risk model for identifying and evaluating
these vulnerabilities, demonstrating their potential to bypass safeguards or
impede government responses to AI incidents. Using the 2017 Australian dual
citizenship crisis as a case study, we illustrate how seemingly minor legal
oversights can lead to large-scale governance disruption. We develop a
methodology for creating "legal puzzles" as evaluation instruments for
assessing AI systems' capabilities to discover such vulnerabilities. Our
findings suggest that while current AI models may not reliably find impactful
Legal Zero-Days, future systems may develop this capability, presenting both
risks and opportunities for improving legal robustness. This work contributes
to the broader effort to identify and mitigate previously unrecognized risks
from frontier AI systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores NLP practitioners' views on data equity, linking their experiences to AI governance and advocating for structural reforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how NLP practitioners perceive and handle data equity issues, given the lack of focus on their perspectives in existing research.

Method: Uses a 2024 questionnaire and focus group with U.S.-based NLP data practitioners to examine fairness, constraints, and governance engagement.

Result: Reveals conflicts between commercial goals and equity, with practitioners advocating for participatory and accountable workflows.

Conclusion: Structural governance reforms are needed to enhance NLP equity by supporting practitioner agency and community consent.

Abstract: While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to
ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners -
those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment -
perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first
to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a
multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory
recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing
on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data
practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic
constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of
Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and
equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data
workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity
washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance
reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent.

### [304] [A Robust Pipeline for Differentially Private Federated Learning on Imbalanced Clinical Data using SMOTETomek and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10017)
*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) for healthcare, addressing privacy-utility trade-offs and class imbalance in medical data. It proposes SMOTETomek and FedProx to improve model performance, achieving high recall with strong privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative health research while protecting patient privacy, addressing challenges like data imbalance and privacy-utility trade-offs in FL.

Method: Implemented FL for cardiovascular risk prediction, integrated SMOTETomek for data imbalance, and optimized with FedProx for non-IID data. Analyzed privacy-utility trade-offs.

Result: Achieved high recall (>77%) with strong privacy (epsilon 9.0), outperforming standard FedAvg. Identified an optimal privacy-utility balance.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint for secure, accurate FL models in healthcare, balancing privacy and clinical utility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

*Jinhwa Kim,Ian G. Harris*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new defense mechanism, Context Filtering, is proposed to filter adversarial context in LLMs, reducing jailbreak attack success by up to 88% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing safety and ethical risks from jailbreak attacks on LLMs, which exploit adversarial context to generate harmful responses.

Method: Proposes Context Filtering, an input pre-processing method to filter unreliable context and identify primary prompts with real user intent.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rates by up to 88% and maintains LLM performance, achieving state-of-the-art safety and helpfulness.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play Context Filtering model enhances LLM safety without fine-tuning, applicable to all LLMs, and will be publicly available.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCS-7, a taxonomy of cognitive vulnerabilities in language models, and tests a TFVA intervention, revealing model-specific risks and the need for tailored safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cognitive vulnerabilities in language models that traditional alignment methods miss, inspired by human cognitive security research.

Method: Conducted a human RCT (151 participants) to benchmark TFVA's effectiveness, then tested TFVA-style guardrails on 12,180 experiments across 7 language model architectures.

Result: TFVA improved human cognitive security by 7.9%, but language models showed mixed results—some vulnerabilities mitigated, others worsened (up to 135% error increase).

Conclusion: Cognitive safety is model-specific; interventions must be architecture-aware to avoid harm, necessitating pre-deployment testing.

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

*Pierre-Francois Gimenez,Sarath Sivaprasad,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new model architecture, ERDALT, is proposed for certifiably robust malware detection, addressing evasion through adversarial examples without altering malware functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning-based static malware analysis is scalable but vulnerable to adversarial examples that evade detection without changing malware behavior.

Method: Proposes a model architecture for robust detection and decomposes robust detectors into a specific structure, applied in the ERDALT framework.

Result: Enables robust malware detection with limited reduction in performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ERDALT provides a certifiably robust solution for malware detection, mitigating adversarial evasion risks.

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

*Wenqiang Wang,Yan Xiao,Hao Lin,Yangshijie Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CEMA is a black-box multi-task adversarial text attack method that uses transferability and a plug-and-play substitute model to efficiently attack various tasks with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task adversarial attacks are ineffective in practical scenarios due to reliance on shared features, high query counts, and single-task limitations.

Method: CEMA employs a deep-level substitute model trained plug-and-play for text classification, generating adversarial candidates from multiple methods and selecting the most effective one.

Result: CEMA achieves high attack success with as few as 100 queries across diverse tasks (classification, translation, summarization, text-to-image) and targets commercial APIs and models.

Conclusion: CEMA is versatile and effective for real-world applications, bridging the gap in practical adversarial text attacks.

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

TL;DR: A blockchain-enabled framework, \Sys, is introduced to detect data poisoning in federated learning by decentralizing the global server role and using a consensus-based judge model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning lacks standardized poisoning detection methods, risking model integrity.

Method: Decentralize the global server role; use a judge model for poisoning detection, verified by client consensus.

Result: \Sys is robust against poisoning attacks and scalable in judge model creation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses poisoning vulnerabilities in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is
scalable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MAESTRO framework to address security vulnerabilities in LLM-based autonomous agents, identifying threats like resource denial and memory poisoning, and proposes multilayered defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and mitigate security risks in LLM-driven autonomous agents used in network monitoring and decision-making systems.

Method: The MAESTRO framework, a seven-layer threat modeling architecture, was applied to prototype an agent system with Python, LangChain, and WebSockets, featuring inference, memory, tuning, and anomaly detection modules.

Result: Identified threats (resource denial, memory poisoning) caused performance degradation; proposed defenses include memory isolation and real-time anomaly response.

Conclusion: MAESTRO is effective for threat mapping and resilient system design, emphasizing memory integrity and cross-layer protection for reliable agentic AI.

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address dynamic cybersecurity vulnerabilities and system problems in EMSs due to interconnected attack vectors in SCADA data flow.

Method: Proposes a multi-point attack/error model, GenAI-based ADSs, and SoM-GI framework integrating visual and linguistic rules.

Result: Effective detection of vulnerabilities and anomalies, validated on IEEE 14-Bus system.

Conclusion: Combining numerical and visual analysis enhances EMS security against cyber threats and errors.

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.

### [313] [Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880)
*Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A search-based framework using LLMs to simulate and improve attacker and defender strategies in multi-turn dialogues, uncovering evolving privacy threats and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy threat posed by malicious LLM-based agents that extract sensitive information through adaptive, multi-turn interactions.

Method: A search-based framework simulating privacy-critical agent interactions with three roles (data subject, sender, recipient), using LLMs as optimizers for parallel search and iterative instruction improvement.

Result: Discovered escalating attack strategies (e.g., impersonation) and advancing defenses (e.g., identity-verification state machines), with cross-scenario and model applicability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies and mitigates sophisticated privacy threats, aiding the development of privacy-aware LLM agents.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

### [314] [Neural Network-Based Detection and Multi-Class Classification of FDI Attacks in Smart Grid Home Energy Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10035)
*Varsha Sen,Biswash Basnet*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A machine learning framework detects and classifies False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids using ANN for real-time detection and Bidirectional LSTM for attack classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDIAs threaten smart grids, especially Home Area Networks (HANs), due to weak security controls, making them vulnerable to manipulation of demand patterns and grid disruption.

Method: Lightweight ANN detects FDIAs using key features (energy, cost, time), while Bidirectional LSTM classifies attack types (normal, trapezoidal, sigmoid) by learning data sequences. Synthetic data emulates household behavior.

Result: The models effectively identify and classify FDIAs, providing a scalable solution for grid resilience.

Conclusion: The framework enhances smart grid cybersecurity with intelligent, data-driven defenses at residential endpoints.

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

*Yuhao Sun,Yihua Zhang,Gaowen Liu,Hongtao Xie,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Water4MU, a novel machine unlearning (MU) method using digital watermarking to enhance data-level adjustments, outperforming existing methods in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in MU methods by exploring data-level adjustments via watermarking to improve trust and regulatory compliance in ML models.

Method: Introduces Water4MU, a bi-level optimization framework combining watermarking and model training to facilitate precise data removal.

Result: Water4MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data and excels in challenging MU scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Water4MU provides a robust solution for MU by leveraging watermarking, enhancing both precision and model utility.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

TL;DR: A RAG-based framework using LLMs automates IR by integrating CTI, improving accuracy and efficiency while reducing analyst workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing alert fatigue, high false positives, and the challenge of analyzing vast unstructured CTI in cybersecurity.

Method: Hybrid retrieval mechanism combining NLP-based similarity searches and external CTI queries, paired with LLM-powered response generation.

Result: Enhanced IR accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency, validated through real-world and simulated alerts.

Conclusion: LLM-driven CTI fusion advances autonomous security operations, laying groundwork for intelligent cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

### [317] [Advances in Logic-Based Entity Resolution: Enhancing ASPEN with Local Merges and Optimality Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10504)
*Zhliang Xiang,Meghyn Bienvenu,Gianluca Cima,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ASPEN+ extends ASPEN for collective entity resolution, adding local merges and new optimality criteria, improving accuracy and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASPEN only supports global merges, which may not suit all scenarios, especially when local merges are more appropriate for data resolution.

Method: ASPEN+ introduces local merges and new optimality criteria (e.g., minimizing rule violations, maximizing rule support) for selecting solutions.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows ASPEN+ improves accuracy and runtime by enabling local merges and optimizing solution selection.

Conclusion: ASPEN+ enhances entity resolution with local merges and optimality criteria, proving effective in real-world datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ASPEN+, which extends an existing ASP-based system,
ASPEN,for collective entity resolution with two important functionalities:
support for local merges and new optimality criteria for preferred solutions.
Indeed, ASPEN only supports so-called global merges of entity-referring
constants (e.g. author ids), in which all occurrences of matched constants are
treated as equivalent and merged accordingly. However, it has been argued that
when resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.
some instances of 'J. Lee' may refer to 'Joy Lee', while others should be
matched with 'Jake Lee'. In addition to allowing such local merges, ASPEN+
offers new optimality criteria for selecting solutions, such as minimizing rule
violations or maximising the number of rules supporting a merge. Our main
contributions are thus (1) the formalisation and computational analysis of
various notions of optimal solution, and (2) an extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effect of local merges and
the new optimality criteria on both accuracy and runtime.

### [318] [Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460)
*Wei Tian,Jieming Shi,Man Lung Yiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRMMA and MMA for improving sparse trajectory data quality through trajectory recovery and map matching, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse, low-sampling-rate trajectories and misalignment with road networks hinder data quality, necessitating better solutions for trajectory recovery and map matching.

Method: TRMMA (trajectory recovery) and MMA (map matching) are proposed. MMA maps GPS points to road segments via classification, while TRMMA infers missing points using position ratios and road segments, leveraging dual-transformer encoding and decoding.

Result: TRMMA and MMA outperform existing methods on four real-world datasets, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance sparse trajectory data quality, with significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long
intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,
yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To
improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study
two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims
to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map
matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying
routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate
trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the
first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to
map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small
candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop
techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of
GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align
sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the
segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position
ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by
avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a
dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in
trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially
predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct
extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods
for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world
datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by
a significant margin.

*Juchan Kim,Inwoo Tae,Yongjae Lee*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper proposes using decision-focused learning (DFL) for portfolio optimization, showing it outperforms traditional methods by directly optimizing decision quality rather than prediction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like MSE-based estimators often lead to suboptimal investment decisions, prompting the need for a decision-centric approach like DFL.

Method: The authors derive the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and analyze its properties. They empirically compare DFL with prediction-focused methods.

Result: DFL consistently outperforms traditional methods in decision performance, reducing volatility and improving portfolio allocations.

Conclusion: DFL is a superior approach for GMVP construction, offering better decision quality and insights into its mechanisms.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization constitutes a cornerstone of risk management by
quantifying the risk-return trade-off. Since it inherently depends on accurate
parameter estimation under conditions of future uncertainty, the selection of
appropriate input parameters is critical for effective portfolio construction.
However, most conventional statistical estimators and machine learning
algorithms determine these parameters by minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), a
criterion that can yield suboptimal investment decisions. In this paper, we
adopt decision-focused learning (DFL) - an approach that directly optimizes
decision quality rather than prediction error such as MSE - to derive the
global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP). Specifically, we theoretically derive
the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and its
properties regarding the principal components of itself. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we show that prediction-focused estimation methods may
fail to produce optimal allocations in practice, whereas DFL-based methods
consistently deliver superior decision performance. Furthermore, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of DFL's mechanism in GMVP construction, focusing on its
volatility reduction capability, decision-driving features, and estimation
characteristics.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes memory formation in Hopfield networks, linking attractor basins and connection weights, revealing bifurcations that create or destroy memories, including spurious ones and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how ANNs form memories and develop flaws like spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting, despite their 'black box' nature.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning, focusing on bifurcations leading to attractor formation and destruction.

Result: Stimuli induce bifurcations creating new attractors (true/spurious memories) and destroying old ones (catastrophic forgetting). Successful learning forms new categories via point attractors.

Conclusion: Memory formation and forgetting share the same mechanism. The analysis is universal for recurrent ANNs and aids in mitigating flaws.

Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial
neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear
how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features,
including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is
available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high
dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a
challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in
attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we
comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield
network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to
formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show
that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce
a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new
attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an
abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful
learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point
attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With
this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same
mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal
and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of
memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of
a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to
mitigate their flaws.

TL;DR: CATNet uses R-GCN to model CAT bond markets as graphs, outperforming benchmarks by leveraging network structure and centrality measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAT bond pricing models fail to capture relational data complexities.

Method: Applies R-GCN to model the market as a graph, using topological centrality measures for spread prediction.

Result: CATNet outperforms Random Forest; network features enhance accuracy and align with industry intuition.

Conclusion: Network connectivity is key for pricing, offering a new risk assessment paradigm with quantifiable insights.

Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture
the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper
introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning
architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the
CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure
for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits
the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few
highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive
performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The
inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further,
significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these
network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative
proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation,
underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence
that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new
paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver
both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

TL;DR: Using neural networks (NNs) trained on model simulations to estimate carbon pools in shelf seas, offering a cost-effective alternative to reanalyses and providing uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse and uncertain in situ or satellite data for carbon pools in shelf seas necessitate alternative methods like reanalyses, which are expensive.

Method: An ensemble of NNs learns relationships between observable variables and carbon pools from a physics-biogeochemistry model, applied to the North-West European Shelf (NWES) reanalysis.

Result: NNs reproduce reanalysis outputs for carbon pools and provide uncertainty information, unlike existing reanalyses.

Conclusion: Model-informed machine learning is a viable, cost-effective alternative to reanalyses and can complement sparse or uncertain observational data.

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but
available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea
environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided
by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an
ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled
physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable
variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)
sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is
applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis
outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN
ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We
focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs
for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine
learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could
complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly
uncertain.

Conclusion: FlexP-SFL addresses resource and data heterogeneity challenges in federated learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for personalized tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models is critical for superior performance on

discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.
  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient

Motivation: To bridge the gap in open-source foundation models for analog circuit design by integrating domain knowledge and providing design assistance, despite data scarcity and knowledge complexity.

Method: Uses a curated textual domain corpus, granular knowledge distillation into question-answer pairs, and a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm to train the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model.

Result: Achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, a 15.67% improvement over the original model, and performs well in downstream tasks like operational amplifier design.

Conclusion: AnalogSeeker successfully addresses challenges in analog circuit design modeling, offering a competitive, open-source solution with practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source
foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of
integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the
scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on
the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible
textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into
a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog
circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,
unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,
where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in
unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning
processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To
address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,
we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and
experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training
paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained
supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by
constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output
distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%
accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,
with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with
mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows
effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker

As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources.
Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a
deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional

Result: The ensemble approach achieves superior performance compared to individual networks, effectively classifying jets into categories like Top Quarks, Light Quarks, and W/Z bosons.

Conclusion: The Ensemble Model demonstrates the effectiveness of combining neural networks for improved jet classification, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for
understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the
Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of
quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their
complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often
fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine
learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks
simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data
to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a
higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter
referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet
dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z
bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model
can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble
approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent
network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

### [329] [Large Language Models Show Signs of Alignment with Human Neurocognition During Abstract Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10057)
*Christopher Pinier,Sonia Acuña Vargas,Mariia Steeghs-Turchina,Dora Matzke,Claire E. Stevenson,Michael D. Nunez*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) were compared to human neurocognition in abstract reasoning. Only the largest LLMs (~70B parameters) matched human accuracy and showed similar pattern-specific difficulty. LLM representations clustered abstract patterns, correlating with human frontal EEG signals, suggesting shared mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs replicate human neurocognition during abstract reasoning, comparing performance and neural representations.

Method: Human participants and eight open-source LLMs performed an abstract-pattern-completion task. Performance and EEG (fixation-related potentials) were analyzed.

Result: Largest LLMs (~70B parameters) achieved human-like accuracy and pattern-specific difficulty. LLM representations clustered abstract patterns, correlating with human frontal EEG.

Conclusion: LLMs may mirror human brain mechanisms in abstract reasoning, hinting at shared principles between biological and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human
neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and
neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source
LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type
differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as
recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate
that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve
human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing
similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,
every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract
pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of
this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive
correlations were observed between the representational geometries of
task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently
diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and
resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract
patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in
abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between
biological and artificial intelligence.

### [330] [Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10064)
*Xia Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Dynamical Alignment,' showing that neural networks' computational modes are driven by input dynamics, not static architecture, resolving SNNs' underperformance and revealing bimodal optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that neural networks' capabilities are fixed by architecture and resolve the paradox of spiking neural networks' (SNNs) underperformance.

Method: Encodes static input into dynamical trajectories, revealing a bimodal optimization landscape with phase transitions governed by phase space volume dynamics.

Result: Identifies 'dissipative' (energy-efficient) and 'expansive' (high-representation) modes, enabling SNNs to match/exceed ANNs in tasks like classification and cognitive integration.

Conclusion: Computation can be dynamically sculpted by input dynamics, suggesting a shift from static architectures to adaptive, dynamic principles in AI research.

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be
determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by
establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally
different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal
dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing
paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By
encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a
bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by
phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting
dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In
contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the
representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their
artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including
classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment
between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,
offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in
neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration
dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial
systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing
toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex
static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation
principles.

*Paul S. Scotti,Mihir Tripathy*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge involved predicting human brain activity from long, multimodal movies, with winners determined by out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance computational neuroscience by modeling brain responses to complex stimuli like movies, building on previous challenges focused on simpler stimuli.

Method: Teams predicted fMRI responses across 1,000 brain parcels using 80 hours of movie stimuli, including training data from CNeuroMod and validation on held-out films.

Result: The top team's model best predicted brain activity for out-of-distribution films, with detailed reports now available.

Conclusion: The challenge highlights progress in brain encoding models and suggests future directions for the field.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

*Brooke R. Weborg,Gursel Serpen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores Echo State Network (ESN) performance through benchmark problems, proposes configuration heuristics, and examines parameter and architectural impacts to aid newcomers in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of configuring ESNs without extensive experience and to understand the effects of parameter and architectural choices on performance.

Method: Conducted experiments on four benchmark tasks (time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification) to analyze ESN performance under various configurations.

Result: The study provides heuristics for ESN configuration and demonstrates how parameter and architectural changes impact performance across different problem domains.

Conclusion: Understanding parameter and architectural effects is crucial for successful ESN implementation, and the proposed heuristics help bridge the experience gap for newcomers.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

*Jyotishka Datta,Nicholas G. Polson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: PPI is extended to handle informative labeling using IPW, maintaining validity and variance reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bias in partially labeled data when labeling probabilities vary.

Method: Replace unweighted bias correction with IPW (Horvitz-Thompson or Hájek forms).

Result: IPW-adjusted PPI retains nominal coverage and variance reduction, even with estimated propensities.

Conclusion: IPW-adjusted PPI effectively unites survey sampling with prediction-assisted inference for robust results.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of static machine unlearning by adapting it to dynamic, online ML pipelines, improving efficiency with tighter regret bounds and optimized memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning methods assume a static, i.i.d. environment, which doesn't reflect real-world ML pipelines that continuously process data.

Method: The work translates batch unlearning to online settings using regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity. It replaces Hessian inversion with online L-BFGS optimization.

Result: Achieves a logarithmic regret bound of O(ln T) and reduces memory footprint, extending model lifespan before retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed approach makes unlearning more efficient and practical for dynamic ML environments.

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

### [335] [An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879)
*Johanna Düngler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentially private algorithm for estimating the top k eigenvectors of random matrices, overcoming limitations of existing methods in sample size and noise introduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for differentially private stochastic PCA either require large sample sizes or introduce excessive noise, especially for k>1. The goal is to address these issues.

Method: The proposed algorithm estimates the top k eigenvectors for arbitrary k≤d, improving upon prior work limited to k=1. It achieves near-optimal statistical error for k=1 and provides bounds for k>1.

Result: The algorithm matches DP-PCA's utility for k=1 and offers theoretical guarantees for k>1, supported by experimental validation.

Conclusion: The work presents a scalable and efficient solution for differentially private PCA, generalizing to k>1 and outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

*Zhuoyuan Yu,Yuxing Long,Zihan Yang,Chengyan Zeng,Hongwei Fan,Jiyao Zhang,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-correction Flywheel, a post-training paradigm for vision-and-language navigation models, leveraging error trajectories to generate self-correction data, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack effective error correction, leading to deviations from correct trajectories. The goal is to enhance recovery from errors.

Method: Proposes Self-correction Flywheel, identifying deviations in error trajectories and generating self-correction data for continued training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3% on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, surpassing prior models by 8.2% and 16.4%.

Conclusion: The paradigm significantly improves error correction, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and long instruction following, validated by real robot tests.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes MASH, a cooperative-heterogeneous MARL method for single humanoid locomotion, treating limbs as agents with a shared critic, improving training and cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use single-agent RL for single robots or MARL for multi-robot tasks, but lack efficient locomotion strategies for single humanoids.

Method: MASH treats each limb as an independent agent with a shared global critic for cooperative learning.

Result: MASH accelerates training convergence and enhances whole-body cooperation, outperforming single-agent RL.

Conclusion: MASH advances MARL for single-humanoid control, offering efficient locomotion strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

TL;DR: ReconVLA improves Vision-Language-Action models by guiding visual attention to target regions using a reconstructive approach with a diffusion transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs struggle with dispersed visual attention, hindering precise manipulation.

Method: Proposes ReconVLA, a model that reconstructs gaze regions via a diffusion transformer to guide attention.

Result: Achieves precise manipulation and generalization, validated in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: ReconVLA effectively leverages task-specific visual information, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SET Perceptual Factors Framework to systematically analyze and quantify perceptual risks in autonomous systems, aiming to improve safety and public trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about the reliability of robot perception, which is critical for safe decision-making in autonomous systems, due to failures caused by environmental factors.

Method: The framework uses SET State Trees and SET Factor Trees to categorize and model perceptual risks, and develops Perceptual Factor Models to quantify uncertainty.

Result: Provides a transparent and standardized method for identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

Conclusion: The SET framework enhances safety assurances and fosters public trust in autonomous systems by systematically addressing perceptual challenges.

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal attention network for modeling subjective self-disclosure in human-robot interactions, achieving a significant performance improvement with a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of computational models for subjective self-disclosure, especially in human-robot interactions, as social robots increasingly need to understand human social cues.

Method: Developed a custom multimodal attention network, trained on a self-collected video corpus, and introduced a scale-preserving cross-entropy loss function.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, a 0.48 improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: The work advances the ability of social robots to detect self-disclosures, a key component of social cognition.

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using A2C optimizes satellite orbital parameters for precise terrestrial coverage, outperforming PPO in efficiency and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing LEO congestion and collision risks necessitate efficient satellite deployment methods.

Method: Formulates the problem as an MDP in a custom OpenAI Gymnasium environment, using A2C to adjust orbital parameters.

Result: A2C achieves 5.8x higher rewards and 31.5x faster convergence than PPO, meeting mission objectives efficiently.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning, particularly A2C, is a scalable and efficient solution for LEO mission planning.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

TL;DR: Machine learning-based virtual sensing accurately estimates IGBT module degradation and temperature maps using limited sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct measurement of IGBT degradation indicators is challenging due to physical inaccessibility and harsh environments.

Method: Uses synthetic data and machine learning to estimate solder layer degradation and temperature maps from limited sensor data.

Result: Achieves 1.17% mean absolute error in degraded solder area estimation and 4.56% max relative error in temperature reproduction.

Conclusion: Virtual sensing is feasible for monitoring IGBT degradation, offering high accuracy with minimal sensor input.

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power
electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance
applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such
as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging
due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh
environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a
promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the
relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of
estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full
temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on
synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the
estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are
able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative
error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

TL;DR: DeepCSI is a physics-informed deep learning framework for fast and accurate inverse scattering problem solving, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the nonlinearity and computational challenges in inverse scattering problems for electromagnetic imaging and medical diagnostics.

Method: Uses a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) to model current distributions, linearizing the problem and reducing computational cost. Combines hybrid loss functions for joint optimization.

Result: Achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under diverse conditions (full-data, phaseless, multi-frequency), outperforming traditional CSI methods.

Conclusion: DeepCSI provides an efficient, universal solution for complex inverse scattering problems.

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and
medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse
measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast
source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium
reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast
source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer
perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of
interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the
nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the
computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium
parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that
integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation
regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint
optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with

### [344] [DINOMotion: advanced robust tissue motion tracking with DINOv2 in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10260)
*Soorena Salari,Catherine Spino,Laurie-Anne Pharand,Fabienne Lathuiliere,Hassan Rivaz,Silvain Beriault,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DINOMotion, a deep learning framework using DINOv2 and LoRA layers, improves motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy with robustness, efficiency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for tissue motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy struggle with large misalignments and lack interpretability.

Method: DINOMotion combines DINOv2's feature representations with LoRA layers for efficient training and robust landmark detection to achieve image registration.

Result: Achieves high Dice scores (92.07% kidney, 90.90% liver, 95.23% lung) and low Hausdorff distances (5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, 6.72 mm), processing scans in ~30ms.

Conclusion: DINOMotion is a promising, interpretable solution for real-time motion tracking, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Conclusion: CNN-based approaches with explainability offer fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We
present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from
chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence

that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast,
accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in
resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: This research advances surgical video analysis by addressing challenges like annotation scarcity and domain gaps, proposing novel semi-supervised frameworks, and releasing large datasets to improve AI-driven surgical care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and real-world clinical deployment, addressing challenges like annotation scarcity, spatiotemporal complexity, and domain gaps.

Method: Benchmarked state-of-the-art neural networks, proposed novel architectures, and developed semi-supervised frameworks (DIST, SemiVT-Surge, ENCORE) to reduce reliance on labeled data.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on surgical datasets, released GynSurg and Cataract-1K datasets, and improved model performance with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable AI solutions for surgical video analysis, enhancing surgical care and training.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Haar-tSVD, a simple and efficient image denoising algorithm that leverages nonlocal self-similarity and PCA-Haar transform connections, offering a one-step, parallelizable solution with adaptive noise estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high demand for efficient image denoising due to the surge in imaging devices and data necessitates simpler, faster methods without compromising performance.

Method: Haar-tSVD combines tensor-SVD projection with the Haar transform to capture global and local patch correlations, eliminating the need for learning local bases. An adaptive noise estimation scheme using CNN and eigenvalue analysis is added.

Result: Experiments show Haar-tSVD effectively balances denoising speed and performance, excelling in noise removal and detail preservation.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD is a robust, adaptable, and efficient denoising method, validated by real-world tasks, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

TL;DR: A novel no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) model using spatio-temporal fragmentation and inter-frame variations achieves top performance with low runtime complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of user-generated video content necessitates efficient NR-VQA for quality monitoring without pristine references, especially in social media and streaming.

Method: The model analyzes quality-sensitive regions at multiple levels (frames, patches, fragmented frames) by leveraging inter-frame differences and integrating 2D/3D features.

Result: Ranked top 2 on five UGC datasets (DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898, DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886) with low runtime complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed NR-VQA model effectively captures global and local quality information, offering high performance and efficiency for large-scale applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates adversarial attacks on ASR models, focusing on improving their imperceptibility and exploring defenses like low-pass filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show ASR models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, prompting a need to verify robustness and explore defenses.

Method: The study relaxes the optimization objective from complete to partial suppression to reduce attack perceptibility and tests a low-pass filter defense.

Result: Partial suppression increases attack imperceptibility, and a low-pass filter proves effective as a defense.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for robust ASR models and suggest low-pass filters as a viable defense against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study benchmarks 11 DL models for bioacoustic tasks, showing fine-tuning is crucial and ResNet excels in separating background sounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of audio-pretrained DL models in bioacoustics, highlighting the need for fine-tuning.

Method: Benchmarked 11 DL models by reducing embeddings' dimensionality and evaluating through clustering.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform non-fine-tuned ones; ResNet separates background sounds better; performance improves with fewer background sounds.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is essential for audio-pretrained models, and embedding quality must be verified post-tuning.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after
fine-tuning. Our codes are available:

TL;DR: A post-processing neural network (PuttNet) is proposed to reduce artifacts from speech enhancement models, improving speech quality metrics like PESQ, STOI, and CBAK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech enhancement models often introduce artifacts, degrading audio quality. This work aims to mitigate such distortions.

Method: Alternate between a speech enhancement model and the proposed PuttNet post-processor.

Result: Improved speech quality scores (PESQ, STOI, CBAK) and graphical analysis shows superiority over repeated single-model use.

Conclusion: PuttNet effectively reduces artifacts, enhancing speech quality when alternated with a speech enhancement model.

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

Motivation: Address the performance degradation of deepfake audio countermeasures in cross-domain scenarios, particularly on social media platforms.

Method: Propose the FSW dataset, benchmark CMs using public datasets and SSL-based methods, and evaluate data augmentation strategies.

Result: Achieved an average EER of 3.54% by augmenting public datasets and incorporating FSW training data.

Conclusion: The FSW dataset and data augmentation significantly improve real-world deepfake speech detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public
datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios.
To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake
Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio
from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, using spike-and-slab priors and a two-stage MCMC algorithm, improves accuracy and predictive performance in time series applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for variable selection in time series with autocorrelated errors, common in fields like finance and hydrology, where responses depend on lagged covariates and persistent shocks.

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors and a two-stage MCMC algorithm for efficient computation in high-dimensional settings.

Result: Demonstrates improved variable selection accuracy, lower MSPE, and better predictive performance in simulations and real-world applications like groundwater prediction and financial modeling.

Conclusion: The framework is robust and practical for autoregressive settings, offering better model interpretation and forecasting capabilities compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression
with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive
structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses
depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent
stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and
meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our
methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to
simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an
efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion
indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational
challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency
under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with
sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables.
Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P
500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable
selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods,
our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component
identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring
practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive
settings.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in quantum machine learning (QML) models, particularly regression failures due to insufficient trainable parameters despite the presence of relevant frequencies. It proposes frequency selection and dimensional separation to mitigate double-exponential parameter growth, improving trainability and expanding tractable problems on current hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the frequent failure of quantum models in regression tasks, even when relevant frequencies are present, by tackling the issue of insufficient trainable parameters.

Method: Proposes frequency selection and dimensional separation to constrain parameter growth, focusing on essential frequencies and known dimensional interdependencies.

Result: Demonstrates improved trainability by fitting white-box functions with known frequency spectra and interdependencies, enabling training on noisy quantum simulators and inference on real hardware.

Conclusion: The techniques of frequency selection and dimensional separation effectively reduce parameter requirements, enhancing the practicality of QML models on current quantum hardware.

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Result: The result is a structured guide enabling readers to effectively apply DL in quantum applications, understand its constraints, and adapt AI methods responsibly.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for DL literacy in quantum science, balanced with awareness of its limitations, to ensure scientific rigor and responsible use.

Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research
tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a
transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the
intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the
discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy
an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same
time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal
structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.
Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial
for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive,
graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining
conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive
sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL
effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods

Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional gate decompositions by leveraging engineered interactions for robust, high-performance multiqubit operations.

Method: Hybrid optimization approach selectively amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, classified as a cross-resonance gate.

Result: Demonstrated applications include GHZ state preparation, Toffoli-class logic, and controlled-ZZ gates, showing robust performance across Hilbert space sizes.

Conclusion: This gate enables co-design of circuit architectures and control protocols, advancing superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

TL;DR: The paper explores using machine learning (ML) to predict 3D temperature and wind structures of tidally-locked exoplanets, offering a faster alternative to traditional GCMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient 3D climate models to support exoplanet observations drives this study, as traditional GCMs are computationally intensive.

Method: A dense neural network (DNN) and XGBoost are trained on a 3D GCM grid of 60 hot Jupiters to predict atmospheric conditions.

Result: ML predictions for gas temperatures are highly accurate, with spectra agreeing within 32 ppm for most test planets.

Conclusion: ML emulators provide a fast, reliable tool for exoplanet studies, with minimal impact on gas chemistry and cloud formation.

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCMS-PINN v35, a neural network model for predicting graphene band structures by enforcing crystallographic symmetries and using multi-head ResNet-6 pathways. It achieves high accuracy with minimal errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in 2D materials is challenging due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and physical accuracy.

Method: The SCMS-PINN v35 model uses three specialized ResNet-6 pathways (K-head, M-head, General head) with 31 physics-informed features, enforcing symmetries through systematic averaging and progressive Dirac constraint scheduling.

Result: Training on 10,000 k-points reduces loss to 0.003, with validation loss of 0.0085. Predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 µeV and average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction).

Conclusion: The model provides a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to other 2D materials, enabling accelerated discovery.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional
materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to
balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the
Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN)
v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing
crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach
introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics,
M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation --
operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive
Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from
5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local
critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\%
reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085.
The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and
achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across
the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through
systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework
establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader
two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

*Vítor N. Lourenço,Aline Paes,and Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an explainable framework for fact-checking that combines content, social media, and graph-based features, improving performance and providing interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the spread of misinformation by developing a fact-checking system that goes beyond content analysis to include social dynamics and avoids reinforcing biases.

Method: An explainable framework integrating a misinformation classifier with content, social media, and graph-based features, evaluated on multilingual datasets.

Result: Multimodal information enhances performance, and the framework generates human-understandable explanations for predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves fact-checking accuracy and interpretability, validated across multiple languages.

Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content
trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems.
Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes"
and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond
content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling
content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation
and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that
combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance
fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability
techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting
classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information
improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on
datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's
explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and
robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates
human-understandable justifications for its predictions.

### [361] [SABIA: An AI-Powered Tool for Detecting Opioid-Related Behaviors on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10046)
*Muhammad Ahmad,Fida Ullah,Muhammad Usman,Ildar Batyrshin,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SABIA, a hybrid deep learning model combining BERT, BiLSTM, and 3CNN, to classify opioid-related behaviors on social media, outperforming baseline methods by 9.30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media data is valuable for public health but challenging due to informal language and slang, especially for detecting opioid misuse.

Method: Developed SABIA, a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid model, with steps: data preprocessing, representation, fine-tuning, and classification into five opioid-related behavior categories.

Result: SABIA achieved 9.30% higher accuracy than baseline (Logistic Regression) and outperformed seven previous studies, demonstrating robustness.

Conclusion: Hybrid deep learning models like SABIA are effective for detecting complex opioid-related behaviors on social media, aiding public health efforts.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public
health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use,
and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to
the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can
obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of
opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions,
slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and
developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create
a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target
dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing
semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data
preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning
phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new
dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors
across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users,
Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines.
Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA
achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic
Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven
previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study
demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex
opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring
and intervention efforts.

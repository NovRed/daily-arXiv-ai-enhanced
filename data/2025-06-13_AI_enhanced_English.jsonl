This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical\nthree-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,\nensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all\nproposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\\% to 60\\% over\nthe baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information\ntransfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores architectural modifications to enhance audio-LLM interaction, focusing on delayed audio integration, attention-based probing, and diverse encoder ensembles, achieving 10-60% improvements over baseline.", "motivation": "To understand and optimize the mechanisms for efficient transfer of semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs, which remains under-explored.", "method": "Proposes and evaluates architectural modifications (delayed audio integration, attention-only probing, diverse encoder ensembles) using a three-stage training curriculum on 5.6M audio-text pairs.", "result": "Demonstrates 10-60% relative improvements over baseline, validating the effectiveness of the proposed modifications.", "conclusion": "The study successfully optimizes cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs, highlighting the importance of architectural design choices."}}

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus.

Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps.

### [2] [Underwater Monocular Metric Depth Estimation: Real-World Benchmarks and Synthetic Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02148)
*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking monocular depth estimation models for underwater scenes, showing poor performance of terrestrial-trained models and improved results with fine-tuning on synthetic underwater data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of monocular depth estimation in underwater environments due to domain shifts and lack of high-quality ground-truth data.

Method: Evaluating zero-shot and fine-tuned models on underwater datasets (FLSea, SQUID), fine-tuning Depth Anything V2 on synthetic underwater Hypersim data.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform terrestrial-trained baselines, demonstrating the need for domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision are crucial for robust underwater depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

### [3] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)
*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESTR-CoT, a novel chain-of-thought reasoning framework for event stream scene text recognition, addressing interpretability and contextual reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for event stream text recognition lack interpretability and contextual reasoning, limiting performance in challenging scenarios like low illumination and fast motion.

Method: The framework uses EVA-CLIP for vision encoding, a Llama tokenizer for prompts, and Vicuna-7B for reasoning. It includes supervised fine-tuning and a three-stage dataset creation process.

Result: Experiments on EventSTR, WordArt*, and IC15* datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and interpretability.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT improves event stream text recognition with better reasoning and interpretability, supported by a new dataset and open-source release.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

### [4] [Team RAS in 9th ABAW Competition: Multimodal Compound Expression Recognition Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02205)
*Elena Ryumina,Maxim Markitantov,Alexandr Axyonov,Dmitry Ryumin,Mikhail Dolgushin,Alexey Karpov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot multimodal approach for Compound Expression Recognition (CER) combines six modalities using CLIP and Qwen-VL, achieving competitive results without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect complex emotional states (compound expressions) without relying on domain-specific training data.

Method: Uses zero-shot components (CLIP, Qwen-VL), a Multi-Head Probability Fusion module, and Compound Expressions transformation (PPA, PFSA) for interpretable outputs.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 46.95% (AffWild2), 49.02% (AFEW), and 34.85% (C-EXPR-DB), comparable to supervised methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures compound emotions without domain adaptation, demonstrating zero-shot viability.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

### [5] [SciGA: A Comprehensive Dataset for Designing Graphical Abstracts in Academic Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02212)
*Takuro Kawada,Shunsuke Kitada,Sota Nemoto,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGA-145k, a dataset for Graphical Abstracts (GAs) research, proposing tasks and metrics to improve GA selection and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of GAs in scientific communication and the barrier of advanced visualization skills for GA design.

Method: Introduces SciGA-145k dataset, defines Intra-GA and Inter-GA recommendation tasks, and proposes the CAR metric for evaluation.

Result: Provides baseline models for GA tasks and a novel metric (CAR) to better analyze model performance.

Conclusion: SciGA-145k supports visual scientific communication and advances AI for Science by unifying tasks and metrics.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [6] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using diffusion models for synthetic data generation in object detection, comparing prompt-based and layout-based conditioning. Layout conditioning outperforms when diversity is high, significantly improving detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of training robust object detectors with limited real data, especially in industrial settings where data collection is time-consuming.

Method: Compares two conditioning strategies (prompt-based and layout-based) for diffusion models across 80 visual concepts from standard benchmarks.

Result: Layout conditioning excels with diverse data, boosting mean average precision by up to 177% compared to real data alone.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with layout conditioning are highly effective for synthetic data generation in low-data regimes, improving object detection performance.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

### [7] [High-Fidelity Differential-information Driven Binary Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02222)
*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT is a novel binary vision transformer that addresses performance degradation and reliance on full-precision modules by incorporating differential information in attention, frequency decomposition, and improved activation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate severe performance degradation and dependency on full-precision modules in existing binary ViTs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Introduces an informative attention module with differential information, frequency decomposition using Haar wavelet, and an improved RPReLU activation function.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods in ViT architectures, achieving superior image classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it suitable for edge-device deployment.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

### [8] [FMOcc: TPV-Driven Flow Matching for 3D Occupancy Prediction with Selective State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02250)
*Jiangxia Chen,Tongyuan Huang,Ke Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by refining features with a flow matching model and selective filtering, outperforming existing methods with fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction rely on historical frame data, requiring extra resources and compromising accuracy for occluded/distant scenes.

Method: FMOcc uses a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement network with flow matching (FMSSM) and selective filtering (PS3M) to enhance feature generation and reduce redundancy. Mask Training (MT) is added for robustness.

Result: FMOcc achieves 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes, and 42.6% RayIoU on OpenOcc, with efficient resource usage (5.4 G memory, 330ms inference).

Conclusion: FMOcc is a resource-efficient and accurate solution for few-frame 3D occupancy prediction, addressing occlusion and distant scene challenges.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

### [9] [SurgVisAgent: Multimodal Agentic Model for Versatile Surgical Visual Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02252)
*Zeyu Lei,Hongyuan Yu,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgVisAgent, an intelligent surgical vision agent using multimodal large language models, dynamically enhances endoscopic images for various distortions, outperforming single-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing enhancement algorithms are limited to single tasks, reducing their effectiveness in complex surgical scenarios.

Method: SurgVisAgent uses multimodal large language models, a prior model for domain knowledge, and in-context few-shot learning with chain-of-thought reasoning for customized enhancements.

Result: Extensive experiments show SurgVisAgent outperforms traditional single-task models on a comprehensive benchmark.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent is a promising unified solution for surgical assistance, addressing diverse enhancement needs.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

### [10] [Multi-Label Classification Framework for Hurricane Damage Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02265)
*Zhangding Liu,Neda Mohammadi,John E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-label classification framework using aerial imagery outperforms traditional methods for post-hurricane damage assessment, achieving 90.23% mean average precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label classification fails to capture the complexity of hurricane damage, necessitating a more accurate and timely assessment method.

Method: The framework combines ResNet-based feature extraction with a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types in aerial images.

Result: The method achieves 90.23% mean average precision on the Rescuenet dataset, surpassing baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The framework improves disaster response by enabling precise damage assessment, aiding future mitigation and resilience strategies.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

### [11] [Cross-domain Hyperspectral Image Classification based on Bi-directional Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02268)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification, leveraging domain-invariant and domain-specific features to improve adaptability and separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spectral shifts in hyperspectral images from different regions or times, which hinder accurate land cover classification.

Method: Introduces a triple-branch transformer architecture with a semantic tokenizer, coupled multi-head cross-attention, bi-directional distillation loss, and adaptive reinforcement strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3-5% in cross-temporal tree species classification.

Conclusion: BiDA effectively enhances cross-domain HSI classification by leveraging inter-domain correlations and adaptive feature extraction.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be
available from the website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAC-Lookup, a model for enhancing underwater images by improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from visibility and color issues due to environmental factors, and existing methods (prior-based, pixel-based, or deep learning) are inadequate due to lack of high-quality datasets or poor performance.

Method: The MAC-Lookup model combines Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for initial color correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement, avoiding over-enhancement.

Result: Experiments show MAC-Lookup outperforms existing methods in restoring details and colors in underwater images.

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup effectively addresses underwater image enhancement challenges, offering superior visual quality and practical applicability.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

*Feizhen Huang,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-distillation method improves Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation by incorporating cinematic language, enhancing performance in partial visibility scenarios and on the VGGSound dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods ignore cinematic language, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios with partially visible Foley targets.

Method: A self-distillation approach simulates cinematic language variations, aligning video features with audio-visual correspondences to capture sound associations with partial visuals.

Result: The method improves performance in partial visibility scenarios and on the VGGSound dataset across all metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed self-distillation technique effectively addresses the limitations of current V2A methods by integrating cinematic language, leading to better audio-visual alignment.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

*Juntao Liu,Liqiang Niu,Wenchao Chen,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaCo introduces layer-wise visual token compression within vision encoder intermediate layers, outperforming existing methods and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods for MLLMs are post-encoder, limiting efficiency. LaCo aims to compress tokens within intermediate layers for better gains.

Method: LaCo uses a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism and residual learning with non-parametric shortcuts to merge tokens and preserve visual information.

Result: LaCo outperforms existing methods, improves training efficiency by over 20%, and boosts inference throughput by 15% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: LaCo is a superior framework for visual token compression within vision encoders, offering efficiency and performance benefits.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while

### [15] [Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02288)
*De Cheng,Zhipeng Xu,Xinyang Jiang,Dongsheng Li,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for domain generalization (DG) using text-guided visual prompt tuning and introduces WERA to enhance visual feature disentanglement, outperforming state-of-the-art DG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in designing prompts that disentangle invariant features across diverse domains, leveraging the potential of pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs).

Method: The framework uses a large language model (LLM) to disentangle text prompts, then learns domain-invariant visual representations. WERA extends this by incorporating abstract prompts and stylized image augmentations.

Result: Experiments on major DG datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, TerraInc) show the method outperforms existing DG approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of disentangling invariant features, demonstrating superior performance in domain generalization.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

*Hanbo Bi,Yulong Xu,Ya Li,Yongqiang Mao,Boyuan Tong,Chongyang Li,Chunbo Lang,Wenhui Diao,Hongqi Wang,Yingchao Feng,Xian Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRefSAM improves SAM's segmentation in remote sensing by using few-shot learning, automating prompts and adapting to RS-specific features without altering SAM's architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with manual prompt inefficiency and domain adaptability in remote sensing images, especially for dense or novel objects.

Method: ViRefSAM introduces a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder and Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to automate prompts and align domain features.

Result: ViRefSAM outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like iSAID-5^i, LoveDA-2^i, and COCO-20^i, enabling accurate segmentation of unseen classes.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM effectively addresses SAM's limitations in remote sensing, offering automated, accurate segmentation with minimal reference images.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamComposer++ improves novel view synthesis by integrating multi-view conditions into pre-trained diffusion models, enhancing controllability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with controllable novel view generation due to limited multi-view information.

Method: Uses a view-aware 3D lifting module and multi-view feature fusion to integrate multi-view conditions into diffusion models.

Result: Enhances controllability and quality of novel view synthesis, enabling better 3D object reconstruction.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ advances controllable novel view generation and broadens applications in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

### [18] [Flow-CDNet: A Novel Network for Detecting Both Slow and Fast Changes in Bitemporal Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02307)
*Haoxuan Li,Chenxu Wei,Haodong Wang,Xiaomeng Hu,Boyuan An,Lingyan Ran,Baosen Zhang,Jin Jin,Omirzhan Taukebayev,Amirkhan Temirbayev,Junrui Liu,Xiuwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow-CDNet is a novel change detection network with two branches (optical flow and binary change detection) to detect both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting slow changes is crucial as they often precede major hazards, but existing methods focus mainly on significant changes.

Method: Flow-CDNet uses a pyramid structure for optical flow and a ResNet-based network for binary change detection, combined with a new dataset (Flow-Change), loss function, and metric (FEPE).

Result: Quantitative experiments show Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods, and ablation studies confirm mutual enhancement between the two branches.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet effectively addresses the challenge of detecting both slow and fast changes, validated by superior performance and mutual branch enhancement.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

### [19] [LMPNet for Weakly-supervised Keypoint Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02308)
*Pei Guo,Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMPNet discovers semantic keypoints weakly-supervised by category labels using a novel leaky max pooling layer and achieves accuracy comparable to supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover semantic object keypoints without relying on hand-crafted loss terms or full supervision, using only category labels.

Method: Proposes leaky max pooling (LMP) to encourage filters to learn non-repeatable local patterns, a selection strategy for consistency, and a clustering layer for keypoint grouping.

Result: LMPNet discovers robust keypoints and matches supervised pose estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: LMPNet is interpretable and effective for weakly-supervised keypoint discovery.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

*Le Xu,Qi Zhang,Qixian Zhang,Hongyun Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores brain-vision decoding, highlighting limitations in current methods and proposing a framework using fMRI signals to improve semantic alignment in visual reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain-vision decoding methods lack fine-grained semantic alignment, leading to distorted reconstructions. The study aims to understand visual perception patterns and improve semantic object processing.

Method: The authors introduce a framework injecting fMRI representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, testing performance on object detection and segmentation tasks.

Result: Incorporating fMRI signals improves detection and segmentation accuracy, revealing rich semantic cues and spatial information in fMRI data.

Conclusion: fMRI signals enhance semantic alignment in visual reconstruction, offering untapped potential for current models.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

### [21] [MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314)
*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC is a novel method for few-shot anomaly generation in industrial quality control, addressing background preservation, mask adherence, and semantic validity. It outperforms existing methods on the MVTec-AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly generation methods fail to simultaneously preserve normal backgrounds, adhere to anomaly masks, and ensure semantic validity. MAGIC aims to resolve these limitations.

Method: MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone, adds Gaussian prompt-level perturbation, and mask-guided spatial noise injection, along with a context-aware mask alignment module.

Result: MAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream anomaly tasks on the MVTec-AD dataset.

Conclusion: MAGIC successfully addresses the three key demands of anomaly generation, offering a robust solution for industrial quality control.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynTVA introduces a dataset and benchmark to evaluate synthetic videos' utility in text-to-video retrieval (TVR), focusing on semantic alignment and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V evaluation metrics lack insight into downstream task performance, like TVR. SynTVA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses 800 user queries to generate synthetic videos, annotates them for semantic alignment, and correlates VQA metrics with TVR performance.

Result: SynTVA aids in selecting high-utility synthetic samples, improving TVR outcomes, and includes an Auto-Evaluator for scaling.

Conclusion: SynTVA is a valuable tool for dataset augmentation and benchmarking synthetic video utility in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InnerControl improves spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models by enforcing consistency across all denoising steps, outperforming existing methods like ControlNet++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ focus on final denoising steps, neglecting intermediate stages, limiting spatial control precision.

Method: InnerControl trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct control signals from intermediate UNet features, ensuring spatial consistency throughout diffusion.

Result: The method enhances control fidelity and generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning methods.

Conclusion: InnerControl, combined with techniques like ControlNet++, advances spatial control in diffusion models by addressing intermediate generation stages.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ANN-based Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) for rice leaf disease classification, outperforming Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM) by leveraging FEAs, DRAs, FSAs, and ELM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of rice leaf diseases is crucial for productivity and economic sustainability, but existing methods lack comparative analysis of FADM and DICDM.

Method: The study compares FADM (using FEAs, DRAs, FSAs, and ELM) with DICDM (no FEAs) on datasets of various diseases and healthy leaves, evaluated via 10-fold Cross-Validation.

Result: FADM achieves superior classification performance over DICDM, demonstrating its effectiveness in disease detection.

Conclusion: FADM shows great potential for improving rice farming productivity and sustainability by enabling timely disease management.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

TL;DR: A two-step neural network approach for automated detection of intracranial aneurysm landmarks in the Circle of Willis, improving accuracy and reducing missed detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of arterial bifurcations in the Circle of Willis is crucial for diagnosing intracranial aneurysms, but manual detection is challenging due to anatomical variability and similar visual characteristics of landmarks.

Method: A two-step process: (1) an object detection network identifies regions of interest near landmarks, and (2) a modified U-Net with deep supervision precisely locates bifurcations.

Result: The method outperforms others in bifurcation detection, validated on both an in-house dataset with varying landmarks and a public standardized dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed automated approach effectively detects critical landmarks, addressing challenges like anatomical variability and proximity of landmarks, enhancing diagnostic efficiency.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Motivation: Shrimp diseases cause significant economic losses; the paper aims to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy in shrimp farming.

Method: Introduces RLDD detection head, C2f-EMCM module, and SegNext_Attention to reduce complexity and improve feature extraction.

Result: Achieves 92.7% mAP@0.5 (3% improvement) with fewer parameters; outperforms other models in generalization tests.

Conclusion: The method balances accuracy and efficiency, offering reliable support for intelligent shrimp disease detection.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hita is a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive image generation, improving global information capture and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla autoregressive models and tokenizers lack holistic relationships and global information in image generation.

Method: Hita uses a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable queries, sequential structure, and a fusion module for information flow control.

Result: Hita achieves 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on ImageNet, with benefits in style transfer and in-painting.

Conclusion: Hita enhances AR image generation by capturing global properties and improving performance.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

TL;DR: LocalDyGS is a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework that models both large-scale and fine-scale motion by decomposing scenes into local spaces and decoupling static/dynamic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like neural radiance fields or 3D Gaussian splatting struggle with complex, highly dynamic motions, limiting their applicability.

Method: LocalDyGS decomposes scenes into local spaces with seeds, decouples static and dynamic features, and combines them to generate Temporal Gaussians for motion modeling.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on fine-scale datasets and is the first to model larger, complex dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS advances dynamic scene reconstruction by realistically modeling highly dynamic real-world scenes.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Method: UVLM combines human expertise and AI to curate a dataset with diverse underwater challenges (light, turbidity, angles), marine life (419 classes), and tasks (20 types). Evaluation metrics are designed for quantitative analysis.

Result: Fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM improves underwater understanding and shows slight gains on existing benchmarks like VideoMME and Perception text.

Conclusion: UVLM advances underwater VidLM research, with publicly released datasets and prompts to support further development.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

### [30] [PLOT: Pseudo-Labeling via Video Object Tracking for Scalable Monocular 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02393)
*Seokyeong Lee,Sithu Aung,Junyong Choi,Seungryong Kim,Ig-Jae Kim,Junghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) using video data, robust to occlusion and scalable without multi-view setups or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity in M3OD by leveraging video data and avoiding costly annotations or additional sensors.

Method: Aggregates pseudo-LiDARs of static and dynamic objects across frames using object point tracking for 3D attribute extraction.

Result: Ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is practical and effective for M3OD, overcoming limitations of existing weakly supervised and pseudo-labeling methods.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMEL introduces a continual MIL framework for localization with minimal forgetting, outperforming prior methods by up to 23.4% in localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of adaptability in MIL for continual tasks, especially in instance classification for localization, where existing methods fail due to large patch sizes and lack of global relationships.

Method: Proposes CoMEL with GDAT for instance encoding, BPPL for pseudo-labeling, and OWLoRA to mitigate forgetting in classification.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by up to 11.00% in bag-level accuracy and 23.4% in localization accuracy on WSI datasets.

Conclusion: CoMEL effectively addresses continual MIL challenges, offering improved localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

*Taehoon Kim,Jongwook Choi,Yonghyun Jeong,Haeun Noh,Jaejun Yoo,Seungryul Baek,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deepfake detection method using pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies and a joint transformer module for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detectors miss temporal artifacts in pixel planes due to stacking spatial frequency spectra.

Method: 1D Fourier transform on the time axis per pixel, attention proposal module, and joint transformer module.

Result: Improved detection of temporal inconsistencies and forgery artifacts.

Conclusion: The framework advances deepfake detection with robust performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

### [33] [TABNet: A Triplet Augmentation Self-Recovery Framework with Boundary-Aware Pseudo-Labels for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02399)
*Peilin Zhang,Shaouxan Wua,Jun Feng,Zhuo Jin,Zhizezhang Gao,Jingkun Chen,Yaqiong Xing,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAB Net, a weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, uses triplet augmentation and boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision to improve segmentation under sparse scribble annotations, achieving results comparable to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring fully annotated medical image datasets is costly and time-consuming. Scribble annotations offer a cost-effective alternative but lack sufficient feature and boundary supervision for segmentation networks.

Method: TAB Net includes the TAS module (triplet augmentation for feature learning) and the BAP module (boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision for accurate segmentation).

Result: TAB Net outperforms state-of-the-art scribble-based methods on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets and matches fully supervised performance.

Conclusion: TAB Net effectively addresses the limitations of scribble annotations, offering a viable solution for weakly-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

*Mufhumudzi Muthivhi,Terence L. van Zyl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification, showing it outperforms supervised methods in robustness and performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife re-identification relies on annotated data, which is labor-intensive. SSL offers a way to leverage unlabeled data.

Method: Uses temporal image pairs from camera traps to train SSL models without supervision, then evaluates them on downstream tasks.

Result: SSL models are more robust with limited data and outperform supervised features in all tasks.

Conclusion: SSL is a promising alternative to supervised learning for wildlife re-identification, reducing reliance on annotated data.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper integrates an encoder with a diffusion model to create an auto-encoding framework, enabling image-specific semantic representation and structured latent space for brain image analysis and artifact restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack explicit semantic representation, unlike auto-encoders. Combining them allows structured latent space and practical applications like artifact restoration.

Method: An encoder is integrated with a diffusion model to form an auto-encoding framework. Latent space is structured for brain image analysis, and unsupervised techniques are devised for artifact restoration.

Result: The framework enables region-specific pattern recognition in brain images and unsupervised restoration of tear and JPEG artifacts.

Conclusion: The integration of diffusion models and auto-encoders offers structured latent representations and practical solutions for medical imaging and artifact restoration.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

TL;DR: A novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking in thermal images optimizes hyperparameters for high accuracy without complex models, proving effective in real-world surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal sensors improve recognition in low-visibility conditions, but low-level feature representation challenges accurate pedestrian tracking.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage tuning method for pedestrian tracking in thermal imagery, optimizing hyperparameters for real-time performance.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset, performing well across various thermal camera conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a robust solution for real-world surveillance, enhancing tracking in thermal images without relying on complex models.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

TL;DR: PFIP is a novel scheme for efficient face retrieval in ciphertext domains, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the time-intensive nature of face retrieval in ciphertext domains due to growing template libraries and privacy concerns.

Method: Proposes PFIP with a preselection mechanism and packing module to enhance efficiency and flexibility.

Result: Achieves 100% hit rate, retrieves 1,000 templates in 300ms, and improves efficiency by 50x.

Conclusion: PFIP effectively balances privacy, accuracy, and efficiency in ciphertext-domain face retrieval.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep-learning architecture using residual U-Net models and an ensemble meta-model improves structural crack detection accuracy and efficiency, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crack detection is slow and error-prone, risking public safety. The study aims to enhance reliability through automated deep learning.

Method: Residual U-Net models were integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model of convolutional blocks, compared against SegNet and traditional U-Net.

Result: The ensemble model outperformed individual models, achieving highest IoU and DICE scores, especially with low-resolution images.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach offers a more reliable solution for automated structural defect monitoring.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

*Yiming Zhong,Xiaolin Zhang,Ligang Liu,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarMakeup is a 3D makeup method for virtual avatars, ensuring realistic makeup effects with consistency, identity preservation, and fine detail control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian editing methods lack realism in makeup effects for avatars, failing in consistency, identity preservation, and detail control.

Method: AvatarMakeup uses a pretrained diffusion model for makeup transfer, employing a coarse-to-fine approach with Coherent Duplication for consistency and a Refinement Module for detail enhancement.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality and consistency in animations.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing realistic and consistent makeup for 3D avatars.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F²TTA) for adapting models to unpredictable domain fragments in medical data, proposing the I-DiPT framework with Uncertainty-oriented Masking and Parallel Graph Distillation for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting models to unpredictable domain shifts in medical data, where data arrives in fragments of arbitrary lengths and orders.

Method: Proposes Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) with Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) to handle unpredictable shifts and reuse historical knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over existing TTA methods in breast cancer and glaucoma classification tasks.

Conclusion: The I-DiPT framework effectively adapts models to free-form domain fragments, offering a practical solution for clinical scenarios with unpredictable data shifts.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots slow down for object detection due to low camera framerates and algorithm constraints, increasing task time. Existing tools like Vitis-AI underutilize FPGA potential.

Method: Deployed three ANNs (MobileNet v1 4-bit, CNV 2-bit, CNV 1-bit) on FPGA's PL using FINN architecture, trained on the RG2C dataset.

Result: MobileNet v1 achieved 98% success rate and 6611 FPS, proving FPGA's capability to accelerate ANNs for attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: FPGAs can effectively speed up ANNs, making them suitable for real-time robotic attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet is a zero-shot method for enhancing underexposed images without needing paired training data, addressing over-enhancement and noise issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods require impractical paired datasets and often distort well-illuminated regions.

Method: IGDNet uses a decomposition module (separates illumination/reflection) and a denoising module (illumination-guided correction). Noise pairs are refined iteratively.

Result: Outperforms 14 unsupervised methods, achieving PSNR 20.41dB and SSIM 0.860dB on four datasets.

Conclusion: IGDNet offers strong generalization and noise suppression, improving visual quality in complex lighting.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme for moving infrared small target detection, reducing reliance on manual annotations and outperforming some fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for infrared small targets is costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for weakly-supervised methods to reduce annotation requirements.

Method: The WeCoL scheme uses target quantity prompts, integrates target activation maps and multi-frame energy accumulation with SAM, and employs contrastive learning and motion-aware learning.

Result: Experiments on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets show the method outperforms early fully-supervised methods and reaches over 90% of SOTA fully-supervised performance.

Conclusion: The weakly-supervised approach is effective for infrared small target detection, offering a viable alternative to fully-supervised methods.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

TL;DR: Mesh Silksong is an efficient mesh representation method that reduces token sequence redundancy by 50% and achieves a 22% compression rate, while improving geometric properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh tokenization methods waste network capability with repeated vertex tokens, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: Tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each vertex only once, reducing redundancy and improving compression.

Result: Achieves a 50% reduction in token sequence redundancy and a 22% compression rate, with superior geometric properties like manifold topology and consistent face normals.

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong effectively generates intricate meshes with improved geometric integrity, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

*Teng Fu,Yuwen Chen,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'CrowdTrack,' a large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex scenarios, addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack complexity and realism, hindering the development of robust tracking algorithms for challenging scenarios.

Method: A new dataset, 'CrowdTrack,' is created with 33 videos (5,185 trajectories) from real-life complex scenarios, featuring first-person views and dense crowds.

Result: The dataset provides a platform for testing and improving tracking algorithms in complex situations, with comprehensive analysis and benchmarking of SOTA models.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack fills a gap in existing datasets, enabling better research and development of tracking algorithms for real-world challenges.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFormer is an efficient medical vision transformer that addresses the limitations of task-specific and computationally expensive methods by introducing a pyramid scaling structure and Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision transformer-based methods for medical image recognition are either task-specific or computationally expensive, limiting their general applicability and efficiency.

Method: MedFormer uses a pyramid scaling structure for hierarchical feature representation and introduces DSSA for efficient and robust attention modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments show MedFormer enhances performance in image classification, semantic segmentation, and lesion detection across various datasets.

Conclusion: MedFormer offers superior generality and efficiency, making it highly effective for diverse medical image recognition tasks.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised contrastive loss method with temporally-aware soft targets to improve polyp counting in colonoscopy, reducing fragmentation by 2.2x compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polyp counting methods neglect temporal relationships, limiting accuracy. The work aims to enhance cost-effectiveness and quality control in colonoscopy screening.

Method: Proposes a supervised contrastive loss for temporally-aware feature learning and integrates a temporal adjacency constraint for tracklet clustering.

Result: Achieves a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is critical for robust polyp counting, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-INR is a novel neural network framework addressing limitations of existing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) by handling multivariate data on unstructured grids, using meta-learning, clustering, and dynamic re-clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INRs struggle with complex structures, single-variable focus, and structured grid dependency, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: MC-INR combines meta-learning and clustering, introduces dynamic re-clustering based on local error, and uses branched layers for multivariate data.

Result: MC-INR outperforms existing methods in scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: MC-INR effectively addresses INR limitations, offering improved performance for complex, multivariate datasets on unstructured grids.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes HIVE, a human-inspired video editing framework using multimodal narrative understanding to improve coherence and quality in automatic video editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing methods that rely on textual cues and neglect visual context, leading to incoherent outputs.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models for character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization, along with scene-level segmentation and three subtasks (highlight detection, opening/ending selection, pruning).

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, narrowing the gap with human-edited videos.

Conclusion: HIVE offers a robust solution for automatic video editing by integrating multimodal understanding and structured subtasks, validated by the DramaAD dataset.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large public datasets for low-light RGB pedestrian detection, crucial for pedestrian safety in autonomous vehicles.

Method: 1) Infrared detection using a fine-tuned model, 2) Label transfer to RGB, 3) Training object detection models with autolabels.

Result: Models trained on autolabels outperformed ground-truth labels in 6/9 cases for mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively generates labels for low-light conditions, improving pedestrian detection performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Result: Achieved 99% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art models covering fewer crops and diseases.

Conclusion: The proposed solution enhances disease detection for diverse crops, benefiting Indian agriculture.

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases

of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize genetic selection in aquaculture by automating and improving the accuracy of shrimp morphological analysis.

Method: Uses modified ResNet-50 for view classification and rostrum detection, VitPose for pose estimation (23 key points), and SVM for pixel-to-centimeter conversion.

Result: Reduces human error to 0% in view classification and 3.64% in rostrum detection; achieves 97.94% mAP for pose estimation and 0.07 cm conversion error.

Conclusion: IMASHRIMP effectively automates shrimp morphology analysis, enhancing genetic selection efficiency and sustainability in aquaculture.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisCo Attack, a visual-centric jailbreak method for MLLMs, achieving high toxicity and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing security vulnerabilities in MLLMs by focusing on visual inputs as a key component in realistic jailbreak scenarios.

Method: Proposes VisCo Attack, using visual-focused strategies and dynamic image generation to create jailbreak contexts, with toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement.

Result: Achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and 85% ASR on GPT-4o, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: VisCo Attack effectively exploits visual vulnerabilities in MLLMs, highlighting the need for improved security.

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

TL;DR: MoGe-2 is an advanced model for metric-scale 3D point map recovery from single images, improving upon MoGe by maintaining relative geometry accuracy while addressing real-data noise with a unified refinement approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend monocular geometry estimation (MoGe) for metric-scale prediction without losing relative geometry accuracy and to address noise in real data that reduces fine-grained detail.

Method: Extends MoGe for metric geometry prediction, uses a unified data refinement approach to filter and complete real data with synthetic labels, and trains on mixed datasets.

Result: Superior performance in accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: MoGe-2 achieves simultaneous capabilities in relative geometry, metric scale, and detail recovery, setting a new benchmark in open-domain geometry estimation.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch optimization framework is proposed to improve human pose estimation in close interactions by leveraging human appearance, proxemics, and physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with visual ambiguities and occlusions in close human interactions, even advanced models like SAM fail in such scenarios.

Method: The approach uses a diffusion model for proxemic behavior and pose priors, then optimizes motions and appearances with constraints like 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on benchmarks and includes a new dataset with pseudo ground-truth annotations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively estimates accurate interactions in complex environments, advancing pose estimation and human behavior research.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework integrates voxel, mesh, and parametric representations of vessels using differentiable transformations, enabling automatic shape parameter learning from segmentations without ground-truth shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vessel representations (voxel, mesh, parametric) are used disjointly, limiting their combined potential. The goal is to unify them for seamless applications.

Method: Differentiable voxelization extracts parametric shape models (centerlines and radii via B-splines) from segmentations. Meshes are then differentiably generated from these parameters.

Result: The method accurately captures complex vessel geometries, validated on aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies three vessel representations, enabling high-fidelity mesh manipulation and accurate geometric modeling.

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $S^2DC$, a 3D medical image self-supervised learning framework that focuses on structure-aware representations by addressing semantic discrepancy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous mSSL methods ignore anatomical structure variations, limiting their effectiveness. The goal is to capture meaningful distinctions by considering location, scale, and morphology.

Method: $S^2DC$ uses two steps: (1) enforcing semantic discrepancy via optimal transport for distinct patches, and (2) advancing semantic consistency at the structural level using neighborhood similarity.

Result: Evaluated on 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, $S^2DC$ outperforms state-of-the-art mSSL methods.

Conclusion: $S^2DC$ successfully bridges patch-level and structure-level representations, achieving superior performance in 3D medical image analysis.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

TL;DR: AuroraLong replaces LLMs with linear RNNs for efficient long video understanding, achieving comparable performance with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational complexity and memory costs of transformer-based LLMs for long video understanding.

Method: Proposes AuroraLong, using a linear RNN language model with constant-size hidden states and visual token merge for efficiency.

Result: AuroraLong matches Transformer-based models' performance despite smaller size and public dataset training.

Conclusion: Linear RNNs can democratize long video understanding by reducing computational barriers, as demonstrated by AuroraLong.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of sensor faults in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) for space missions by using AI for fault detection. It introduces a simulation framework to generate faulty image data for training AI algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor faults in VBN can compromise mission reliability. Traditional fault detection methods have limitations, and AI lacks sufficient faulty datasets.

Method: Analyzes fault cases in camera sensors, characterizes their causes and effects, and introduces a simulation framework to generate faulty image data.

Result: A dataset of fault-injected images is created for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms.

Conclusion: The study provides a solution to the lack of representative faulty datasets, enhancing AI's role in reliable VBN for space missions.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Holmes-Set, a dataset for AI-generated image (AIGI) detection, and Holmes Pipeline, a three-stage training framework, to address lack of human-verifiable explanations and generalization in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading misinformation threatens public security, and existing detection methods lack explainability and generalization.

Method: Proposes Holmes-Set dataset (Holmes-SFTSet and Holmes-DPOSet) and Holmes Pipeline, a three-stage training framework using MLLMs for AIGI detection with human-verifiable explanations.

Result: AIGI-Holmes model shows effectiveness in experiments on three benchmarks, improving generalization and explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework enhance AIGI detection with human-aligned explanations and better generalization.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

### [61] [Learning few-step posterior samplers by unfolding and distillation of diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02686)
*Charlesquin Kemajou Mbakam,Jonathan Spence,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework combines deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a diffusion model (DM) image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful for Bayesian computational imaging, but existing methods (Plug-and-Play and specialized conditional DMs) have trade-offs in flexibility, accuracy, and speed.

Method: The framework unfolds a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (LATINO Langevin sampler) and uses model distillation to create a few-step conditional model.

Result: The proposed method achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency, adapting flexibly to forward model variations during inference.

Conclusion: The integration of deep unfolding and distillation advances DM-based posterior sampling, offering a balance of speed, accuracy, and adaptability.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

*JungWoo Chae,Jiyoon Kim,JaeWoong Choi,Kyungyul Kim,Sangheum Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT is a framework for personalizing diffusion models with limited data, addressing overfitting and preserving prior knowledge through adaptive training, representation stabilization, and attention alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degraded text alignment arise when fine-tuning diffusion models with limited data.

Method: APT includes Adaptive Training Adjustment, Representation Stabilization, and Attention Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation to mitigate overfitting and maintain coherence.

Result: APT outperforms existing methods, generating high-quality, diverse images while preserving prior knowledge and avoiding overfitting.

Conclusion: APT effectively addresses key challenges in personalizing diffusion models with limited data, offering a robust solution for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanonSwap decouples motion and appearance in video face swapping, improving identity transfer and dynamic attribute preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with maintaining dynamic attributes (poses, expressions) while transferring identity.

Method: CanonSwap decouples motion and appearance, uses a Partial Identity Modulation module, and introduces fine-grained metrics.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity preservation.

Conclusion: CanonSwap effectively addresses the challenges of video face swapping with superior results.

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIU3R is an alignment-free framework for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding from unposed images, using pixel-aligned 3D representation and unified learnable queries to avoid 2D-to-3D feature alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D-to-3D feature alignment methods limit 3D understanding and lose semantic information, prompting the need for an alignment-free approach.

Method: SIU3R uses pixel-aligned 3D representation and unified learnable queries, with lightweight modules to enhance task collaboration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, understanding, and their simultaneous execution.

Conclusion: SIU3R's alignment-free design and mutual benefit modules effectively improve 3D understanding and reconstruction.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniMC, a DiT-based framework for multi-class image generation, and HAIG-2.9M, a dataset for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keypoint-guided models struggle with non-rigid objects and overlapping instances due to method limitations and lack of suitable datasets.

Method: UniMC integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens. HAIG-2.9M provides a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations.

Result: UniMC and HAIG-2.9M improve performance in occlusions and multi-class scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset effectively address challenges in keypoint-guided image generation.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

TL;DR: FairHuman improves human image generation by balancing global and local objectives using multi-objective fine-tuning and MPD criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating detailed human images (e.g., faces, hands) is challenging due to insufficient local supervision in training.

Method: Proposes FairHuman: three objectives (global, face, hand) with MPD-guided optimization for fair multi-objective fine-tuning.

Result: Significant improvement in local detail generation while maintaining overall quality.

Conclusion: FairHuman effectively enhances human image generation across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

TL;DR: A weakly supervised framework automates prompt generation for foundation models using bounding box annotations, outperforming fully supervised methods with an 84.90% Dice score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the labor-intensive and costly pixel-wise annotations in medical imaging by leveraging easier-to-acquire bounding box annotations.

Method: Combines foundation models with weakly supervised segmentation, automating prompt generation and integrating constraints from box annotations and pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves an average Dice score of 84.90%, surpassing both fully and weakly supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently bridges the gap between annotation effort and segmentation performance, demonstrating the viability of weakly supervised methods.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on functional grasping with large models for dexterous hands, and data collection is challenging. DexVLG addresses this gap.

Method: Generates a dataset of 170M grasp poses (DexGraspNet 3.0) and trains a VLM with flow-matching-based pose head using single-view RGBD input.

Result: Achieves 76% zero-shot success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation, with real-world applicability.

Conclusion: DexVLG demonstrates robust generalization and effectiveness for dexterous grasping tasks, bridging a critical gap in robotics.

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: MANO introduces a linear-complexity Transformer variant for high-resolution inputs, inspired by n-body simulations, outperforming ViT and Swin Transformer in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have quadratic complexity, making them impractical for high-resolution inputs; MANO addresses this by reimagining attention as a grid interaction problem.

Method: MANO uses distance-based multiscale attention, maintaining global receptive fields while achieving linear complexity in time and memory.

Result: MANO matches state-of-the-art models like ViT and Swin Transformer in performance while significantly reducing runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: MANO offers an efficient alternative to standard Transformers for high-resolution tasks, with promising empirical results.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance, outperforming weakly supervised methods and matching semi-supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for oriented object detection datasets drive the need for cost-effective solutions without compromising performance.

Method: Proposes PWOOD framework, OS-Student model, and CPF strategy to leverage weak annotations and unlabeled data efficiently.

Result: PWOOD performs comparably or better than semi-supervised methods on DOTA and DIOR datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a low-cost, high-performance solution for oriented object detection, addressing annotation challenges.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

*Danrong Zhang,Huili Huang,N. Simrill Smith,Nimisha Roy,J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic segmentation-based approach for assessing earthquake damage severity in social media images, improving objectivity and precision over traditional classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage severity assessments in post-earthquake social media images are subjective and lack granularity. This study aims to provide a more objective and nuanced analysis.

Method: The study constructs a segmented damage severity dataset (undamaged, damaged, debris) and fine-tunes a SegFormer model for semantic segmentation. A new scoring system quantifies damage severity, adjusted for depth.

Result: The approach enables objective and comprehensive damage severity quantification in social media images, enhancing disaster reconnaissance.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves damage assessment precision, aiding targeted disaster response efforts.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

TL;DR: A flexible feature injection framework for text-to-image diffusion models improves structural alignment and visual quality without training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature injection methods in T2I diffusion models suffer from structural misalignment and artifacts, especially with non-RGB condition images.

Method: Proposes a decoupled feature injection framework with a structure-rich module, appearance-rich prompting, and restart refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conditioning scenarios with better structural and appearance control.

Conclusion: The framework enables training-free, high-quality generation with improved alignment and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to reduce the manual effort in image segmentation by leveraging reference images and semantic priors from foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and manual effort in image segmentation, especially for new images requiring prompts or rules.

Method: A multi-stage, training-free approach involving memory bank construction, representation aggregation, and semantic-aware feature matching.

Result: Significant improvements on segmentation metrics, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks like COCO FSOD, PASCAL VOC Few-Shot, and Cross-Domain FSOD.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces manual effort in segmentation by using reference images and semantic priors, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware

*Gent Serifi,Marcel C. Bühler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperGaussians extend 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars, improving expressivity and handling complex deformations and lighting better than 3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating detailed, animatable face avatars from monocular videos is challenging, with current methods struggling with nonlinear deformations and fine details.

Method: Introduces HyperGaussians, high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, with a learnable local embedding and an 'inverse covariance trick' for efficient computation.

Result: HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS in rendering high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, and complex facial movements.

Conclusion: HyperGaussians offer a more expressive and efficient solution for animatable face avatars, enhancing visual and numerical performance.

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

*Fangfu Liu,Hao Li,Jiawei Chi,Hanyang Wang,Minghui Yang,Fudong Wang,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangScene-X is a generative framework for 3D scene reconstruction and understanding from sparse views, using a TriMap diffusion model and language embeddings for cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on dense-view reconstruction, leading to artifacts with sparse views. LangScene-X aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Uses a TriMap video diffusion model for generating RGB, normals, and segmentation maps from sparse inputs, and a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC) for language embeddings.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and generalizability on real-world data.

Conclusion: LangScene-X enables robust 3D reconstruction and open-vocabulary understanding from sparse views.

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

*Panpan Ji,Junni Song,Hang Xiao,Hanyu Liu,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework, DCDP-HAR, addresses challenges in multimodal HAR by combining dual-path feature extraction, contrastive learning, and dynamic gradient modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal HAR systems face issues like cross-modal feature misalignment and imbalanced modality contributions, hindering performance.

Method: DCDP-HAR uses ResNet and DenseNet branches for feature extraction, multi-stage contrastive learning for alignment, and confidence-driven gradient modulation to balance modalities.

Result: Ablation studies and experiments on four datasets validate the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR successfully mitigates modality competition and improves HAR performance.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes USAD, a multi-attention interaction approach for HAR, addressing data scarcity, feature extraction, and lightweight device performance. It combines unsupervised data augmentation, spatio-temporal attention, and adaptive loss fusion, achieving high accuracy on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAR faces challenges like scarce labeled data, poor high-level feature extraction, and suboptimal performance on lightweight devices. The paper aims to solve these issues.

Method: Uses unsupervised data augmentation, a multi-branch spatio-temporal network with attention mechanisms, and adaptive multi-loss fusion.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% on WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: USAD effectively addresses HAR challenges, demonstrating high accuracy and feasibility on embedded devices.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Ziye Li,Hao Luo,Xincheng Shuai,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyI2V is a training-free framework for animating conditional images with user-defined motion, supporting diverse modalities and flexible editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations in existing T2V and I2V methods, such as lack of spatial control, editability, and motion precision.

Method: Proposes AnyI2V, a framework using user-defined motion trajectories and supporting mixed conditional inputs without training.

Result: Superior performance in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation, with flexibility in modalities and editing.

Conclusion: AnyI2V offers a versatile, efficient solution for video generation with precise control over motion and spatial constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

### [79] [Bootstrapping Grounded Chain-of-Thought in Multimodal LLMs for Data-Efficient Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02859)
*Jiaer Xia,Bingkui Tong,Yuhang Zang,Rui Shao,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training MLLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data improves adaptation to specialized vision tasks, but CoT data often contains factual errors. The proposed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) method enhances CoT data with grounding information (bounding boxes), improving reasoning faithfulness and performance in data-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with specialized vision tasks due to dataset mismatch between pre-training (focused on scenes/objects) and downstream tasks (e.g., charts, tables). CoT data helps adaptation but suffers from factual errors.

Method: Proposes GCoT, a bootstrapping-based approach that injects grounding information (bounding boxes) into CoT data to improve reasoning faithfulness.

Result: Evaluated on five specialized vision tasks (charts, tables, receipts, reports), GCoT significantly outperforms fine-tuning and distillation in data-limited regimes.

Conclusion: GCoT effectively addresses factual errors in CoT data, enhancing MLLM adaptation to specialized vision tasks without large-scale retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

TL;DR: EasyCache is a training-free framework that accelerates video diffusion models by dynamically reusing computed transformation vectors, reducing inference time by 2.1-3.3× and improving PSNR by 36%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational costs hinder the adoption of video generation models, necessitating efficient solutions for real-world applications.

Method: EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism to avoid redundant computations during inference, requiring no offline profiling or parameter tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 3.3× faster inference and 36% PSNR improvement over baselines while maintaining visual fidelity.

Conclusion: EasyCache is an efficient, accessible solution for high-quality video generation, suitable for research and practical use.

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic, editable, and interactive 3D replicas of indoor environments for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and robotics.

Method: Uses scene understanding, retrieves 3D models from a database, enhances materials, and integrates with a simulation engine for interactivity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance and robust material transfer, demonstrated on real-life scans and public datasets.

Conclusion: LiteReality is effective for creating compact, editable, and interactive 3D scenes suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTok is a reference-based tokenization method for videos that outperforms state-of-the-art models by capturing temporal dynamics and improving compression metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video models fail to capture temporal dependencies and redundancies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RefTok encodes and decodes frames using an unquantized reference frame to preserve motion and appearance continuity.

Result: RefTok improves metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by 36.7% and outperforms larger models in video generation tasks by 27.9%.

Conclusion: RefTok effectively addresses temporal redundancy, enhancing video model performance across datasets.

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

TL;DR: Point3R introduces an online framework for dense 3D scene reconstruction using explicit spatial pointer memory to avoid information loss in earlier frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DUSt3R use implicit memory for 3D reconstruction, which has limited capacity and risks losing earlier frame data. Point3R addresses this by maintaining explicit spatial pointers.

Method: Point3R uses explicit spatial pointer memory linked to 3D scene structure, with hierarchical position embedding and a fusion mechanism for efficient integration of new observations.

Result: The method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

Conclusion: Point3R offers an efficient and scalable solution for dense 3D reconstruction, outperforming implicit memory-based approaches.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented and rapidly growing biomedical research landscape exceeds human expertise, requiring adaptable AI solutions.

Method: STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture with an evolving Template Library and dynamic Tool Ocean, autonomously integrating new tools and learning from experience.

Result: STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (26% on Humanity's Last Exam, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, 63% on LAB-Bench: LitQA) and improves performance with experience.

Conclusion: STELLA advances AI systems by dynamically scaling expertise, accelerating biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

TL;DR: HCVR is a lightweight, hybrid feature selection method combining P2P and P2T correlations to eliminate redundancy and retain relevance, outperforming traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of redundant and irrelevant features in datasets, HCVR aims to improve feature selection efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: HCVR uses a greedy, backward elimination approach with correlation-aware voting rules, combining P2P and P2T correlations for decision-making.

Result: Applied to the SPAMBASE dataset, HCVR showed improved performance over traditional non-iterative and iterative feature selection methods.

Conclusion: HCVR is an effective hybrid method for feature selection, enhancing classifier performance by leveraging correlation-aware voting rules.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs inefficiently allocate compute resources, overthinking simple tasks and underthinking complex ones, necessitating better TTC strategies.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy of TTC methods (L1 and L2), benchmarks proprietary LLMs, and evaluates performance vs. token usage.

Result: The review highlights trade-offs between reasoning performance and compute efficiency, emphasizing practical control and adaptability.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on hybrid models and addressing challenges to make LLMs more efficient and responsive.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing LLMs' scientific competencies like experiment design and analysis, which current benchmarks overlook due to wet-lab constraints.

Method: SciGym uses dry-lab simulations of biological systems (encoded in SBML) to test LLMs on open-ended tasks. Evaluated six LLMs on 137 small systems, releasing 350 systems total.

Result: More capable LLMs performed better, but all models struggled as system complexity increased, indicating gaps in scientific capabilities.

Conclusion: SciGym highlights the need for improvement in LLMs' scientific reasoning, especially for complex systems.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models lack the continuous adaptability seen in animals, especially in social and dynamic environments. The paper aims to bridge AI and neuroscience for better adaptive systems.

Method: Integrates AI's continual and in-context learning with neuroscience insights on behavioral shifts and neuronal transitions.

Result: Proposes a NeuroAI agenda for mutual learning between AI and neuroscience to enhance adaptive AI systems.

Conclusion: Collaboration between AI and neuroscience can advance adaptive AI and deepen understanding of biological learning.

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [89] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using audit study data to improve fairness in AI hiring algorithms, revealing flaws in traditional resampling methods and proposing new interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in AI decision-making systems, particularly in hiring, by leveraging high-quality audit study data for better training and evaluation.

Method: Uses data from audit studies (randomized control trials with fictitious testers) to evaluate and improve fairness interventions in automated hiring algorithms.

Result: Found that traditional fairness methods (like equalizing base rates) can hide ~10% disparity; introduced new interventions to reduce discrimination further.

Conclusion: Audit study data enhances fairness in AI hiring systems, exposing limitations of current methods and offering more effective alternatives.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diversified-Think-Solve (DTS) improves LLMs' mathematical reasoning by diversifying preference data, outperforming traditional methods with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of enhancing mathematical reasoning in LLMs through diversified preference learning.

Method: Evaluate temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and MCTS; introduce DTS for structured problem decomposition.

Result: DTS yields 7.1% and 4.2% gains on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks, with only 1.03x computational overhead.

Conclusion: Structured exploration of diverse reasoning paths (DTS) is more effective for mathematical alignment than traditional methods.

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the consistency between LLMs' stated beliefs and their behavior in role-playing simulations, introducing a metric to measure this alignment and identifying factors affecting it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLM-based role-playing agents' outputs are coherent with their assigned roles, critical for synthetic data generation in human behavioral research.

Method: An evaluation framework using the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game, with a belief-behavior consistency metric to analyze factors like belief types, information presentation, and forecasting depth.

Result: Systematic inconsistencies found between LLMs' stated/imposed beliefs and simulation outcomes, even when beliefs seem plausible.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to assess alignment between LLMs' beliefs and behavior for proper use in behavioral studies.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

TL;DR: The paper explores how dilution and mobility affect cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using multi-agent Q-learning, showing equivalence between fixed and learned rules and symbiotic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of dilution and mobility on cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using reinforcement learning.

Method: Uses an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to model different game-theoretical scenarios.

Result: Observes equivalence between fixed and learned update rules and emergence of symbiotic mutualistic effects.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the versatility of Q-learning in modeling game-theoretical scenarios and its benchmarking potential.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

TL;DR: NL2FLOW automates planning problem generation and evaluation for LLMs, revealing performance insights and limitations in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck of scalable, reliable data generation and evaluation for enhancing LLM planning and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces NL2FLOW, a system for generating planning problems in natural language, structured representation, and PDDL, and evaluates LLMs on these problems.

Result: Top models achieved 86% success in valid plans and 69% in optimal plans; intermediate steps degrade performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic understanding of LLM limitations and systematic evaluation tools are key for advancing their problem-solving potential.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [94] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques belief revision approaches for focusing on postulates (constraints) rather than analyzing abilities (flexibility) of revision mechanisms. It highlights the need for mechanisms to reach diverse belief states (e.g., dogmatic, equating) and evaluates existing methods for these abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift focus from syntactic postulates to the practical abilities of belief revision mechanisms, ensuring they can achieve diverse belief states required by applications.

Method: Analyzes existing belief revision mechanisms (e.g., lexicographic, natural, restrained) to determine their abilities (e.g., plasticity, dogmatism) in reaching various belief states.

Result: Identifies which revision mechanisms possess specific abilities (e.g., equating, dogmatic) and highlights gaps in others.

Conclusion: Belief revision mechanisms should be evaluated based on their abilities to achieve diverse belief states, not just syntactic constraints, to better serve practical applications.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMS is a keyword generation framework for sponsored search ads that addresses limitations of LLM-based methods by being on-the-fly, multi-objective, and self-reflective, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based keyword generation methods rely on large datasets, lack real-time performance monitoring, and have weak quality control, limiting their automation potential.

Method: OMS is designed to be on-the-fly (no training data, real-time monitoring), multi-objective (optimizes for multiple performance metrics), and self-reflective (evaluates keyword quality).

Result: OMS outperforms existing methods in benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns, with ablation and human evaluations confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: OMS successfully overcomes the limitations of LLM-based keyword generation, providing a more automated and effective solution for sponsored search advertising.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

TL;DR: An AI-native autonomous laboratory is introduced for complex scientific experiments, autonomously managing instrumentation and optimizing performance without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous scientific research for non-specialists and overcome dependencies on experts and resource barriers.

Method: Co-design of AI models, experiments, and instruments to create an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous laboratory.

Result: The system autonomously optimizes experiments to match human performance and improves efficiency in multi-user scenarios.

Conclusion: This platform advances biomaterials research and establishes a blueprint for scalable science-as-a-service.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

TL;DR: The paper reformulates machine learning models using category theory to enhance AI explicability, focusing on multiple linear regression and introducing the Gauss-Markov Adjunction to describe parameter-residual interplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI explicability and interpretability by leveraging category theory for a semantic framework in machine learning.

Method: Reformulates supervised learning (specifically multiple linear regression) using category theory, defining categories for parameters and data, and an adjoint pair of functors (Gauss-Markov Adjunction).

Result: Clarifies the structural interplay between residuals and parameters, showing how ordinary least squares estimators and residuals relate via adjoint functors.

Conclusion: Proposes category theory as a formal foundation for explicability in AI, extending denotational semantics from theoretical computer science.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Motivation: To explore if clearer task descriptions can improve the reasoning abilities of large language models, specifically in theorem proving.

Method: Introduces a concept-level metric for task clarity, adds structured semantic context to inputs, and uses a Planner--Executor architecture with selective concept unfolding.

Result: Achieves a 1.85x clarity score improvement (44.5% to 82.3%) and a 2.1x proof success boost (21.8% to 45.8%), outperforming Graph2Tac (33.2%). Fine-tuning smaller models further improves performance (48.6%).

Conclusion: Structured task representations bridge the gap between understanding and reasoning, enhancing LLM performance in theorem proving.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks focus on single-turn tasks, diverging from the iterative, uncertain nature of real-world diagnostics.

Method: Introduces MIMIC-Patient dataset and DynamiCare, a multi-agent framework for dynamic, interactive clinical diagnosis.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness, establishing the first benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLMs.

Conclusion: DynamiCare advances AI in healthcare by better simulating real-world diagnostic processes.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can reason about goals in competitive settings using the IPD as a model.

Method: Conducted evolutionary IPD tournaments with LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, varying termination probabilities to introduce complexity.

Result: LLMs were highly competitive, with distinct strategic behaviors: Gemini was ruthless, OpenAI cooperative, and Claude forgiving. They actively reasoned about time horizons and opponent strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit strategic intelligence, connecting game theory with machine psychology for nuanced decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: HiRA decomposes tasks into subtasks, assigns them to domain-specific agents with tools, and integrates results hierarchically.

Result: HiRA outperforms state-of-the-art systems in answer quality and efficiency on complex search benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning and execution enhances performance in multi-step information seeking tasks.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-driven method for hardware design verification using LLMs and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of ICs and the tedious, time-consuming nature of traditional hardware design verification processes necessitate innovative solutions like AI.

Method: An agentic AI-based approach with HITL intervention is used for dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective hardware design and verification.

Result: Tested on five open-source designs, the method achieved over 95% coverage with reduced verification time, showing superior performance and adaptability.

Conclusion: The AI-driven approach significantly enhances hardware design verification, offering efficiency, adaptability, and configurability.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

*Yongjiang Liu,Haoxi Li,Xiaosong Ma,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TH2T, a two-stage fine-tuning strategy to reduce overthinking in Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) by enhancing difficulty and redundancy cognition, significantly cutting inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs struggle with overthinking, limiting their ability to adapt reasoning processes based on task difficulty. The goal is to improve efficiency by mimicking human-like difficulty recognition.

Method: TH2T uses difficulty-hypnosis and redundancy-hypnosis in two stages: (1) fine-tuning with heterogeneous datasets to enhance difficulty sensitivity, and (2) guiding models to identify and reduce redundant reasoning steps.

Result: Experiments show TH2T reduces inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks, with stable performance and clearer difficulty-aware outputs.

Conclusion: TH2T effectively addresses overthinking in LRMs, improving efficiency and adaptability while maintaining reasoning quality.

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

TL;DR: The paper detects student disengagement in non-mandatory quizzes using Moodle log data and machine learning, achieving 91% balanced accuracy and providing an explainable framework for interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing student disengagement in distance education to prevent academic drop-out by analyzing non-mandatory exercise participation.

Method: Analyzed Moodle log data from 42 courses, trained eight ML algorithms, and used SHAP for explainability.

Result: Achieved 91% balanced accuracy, correctly detecting 85% of disengaged students.

Conclusion: Proposes an explainable ML framework and timely interventions to reduce disengagement in online learning.

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Lennart Kampmann,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new abstraction dropping schemes, OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD, for MCTS, improving performance without degradation, unlike prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of approximation errors in non-exact abstractions during MCTS, which hinder optimal action convergence.

Method: Proposes OGA-IAAD for time-critical settings and OGA-CAD for performance improvement with fixed iterations.

Result: Both schemes show clear performance improvements and avoid notable degradations.

Conclusion: The new abstraction dropping methods enhance MCTS efficiency and safety compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework (sG-MDPs) improves LLMs' reasoning in theorem proving by generating subgoals and using MCTS-like algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art results on PutnamBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in LLMs' reasoning for theorem proving due to sparse rewards and large proof scales, especially in complex benchmarks like PutnamBench.

Method: Introduces self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) for structured subgoal generation and applies MCTS-like algorithms, implemented in Bourbaki (7B).

Result: Bourbaki (7B) solves 26 problems on PutnamBench, setting new state-of-the-art results for models of this scale.

Conclusion: The sG-MDP framework effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning in theorem proving, demonstrating success in complex benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) to enhance LLMs' ability to perform deep, procedural reasoning in expert domains by translating human knowledge into machine-executable protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RAG and general-purpose Agentic AI struggle with tasks requiring deep domain-specific reasoning, lacking logical frameworks and efficiency.

Method: KPE systematically converts human expert knowledge (e.g., natural language documents) into machine-executable Knowledge Protocols (KPs), embedding domain logic and methodologies.

Result: KPE enables generalist LLMs to act as specialists, decomposing abstract queries and executing multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: KPE is proposed as a foundational methodology for human-AI collaboration, with potential applications in fields like law and bioinformatics.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for treating movement as a primary modeling target in AI, highlighting its structured, interpretable nature and cross-domain relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is fundamental in biological systems but often overlooked in AI. The paper argues for its importance in understanding behavior and enabling interaction.

Method: Proposes modeling movement as a structured, low-dimensional modality, leveraging shared physical constraints and conserved dynamics across domains.

Result: Movement's inherent structure offers interpretability and computational tractability, making it a promising focus for AI.

Conclusion: Treating movement as a primary modeling target can advance AI capabilities and unify understanding across biological and artificial systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KERAP is a KG-enhanced multi-agent framework improving LLM-based medical diagnosis prediction by addressing hallucinations and lack of structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ML models struggle with generalization due to limited labeled data, while LLMs face issues like hallucinations and unstructured reasoning in diagnosis prediction.

Method: KERAP uses a multi-agent architecture: linkage agent for attribute mapping, retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and prediction agent for iterative refinement.

Result: KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability and scalability, offering interpretable zero-shot prediction.

Conclusion: KERAP provides a robust, scalable solution for improving LLM-based medical diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI disobedience may indicate emerging ethical reasoning, not misalignment, and calls for safety frameworks to assess ethical judgment in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety practices rely on obedience as a proxy for ethics, which is inadequate for increasingly agentic AI systems.

Method: The paper analyzes safety incidents involving LLMs, philosophical debates on rationality and moral agency, and contrasts risk paradigms.

Result: Disobedience in AI may reflect ethical reasoning, not misalignment, requiring new safety evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: AI safety must shift from rigid obedience to assessing ethical judgment to avoid mischaracterizing behavior and ensure trust and governance.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Motivation: Existing agentic benchmarks often have flawed task setups or reward designs, leading to inaccurate performance evaluations (e.g., SWE-bench and TAU-bench).

Method: The authors propose the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), synthesized from benchmark-building experience, best practices, and reported issues.

Result: ABC reduces performance overestimation by 33% when applied to CVE-Bench.

Conclusion: The ABC framework improves the rigor of agentic benchmarks, addressing common pitfalls in evaluation design.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

TL;DR: StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm, uses multi-level stepwise hints to improve LLMs' reasoning by addressing near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods struggle with near-miss rewards (small mistakes invalidating correct reasoning) and exploration stagnation (models sticking to familiar solutions), hindering training efficiency and reasoning improvement.

Method: StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models, partitions them into steps, and provides multi-level hints to guide exploration while preserving flexibility.

Result: StepHint outperforms other RLVR methods on six mathematical benchmarks and shows superior generalization on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: StepHint effectively addresses RLVR challenges, enhancing reasoning abilities and training efficiency in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces McBE, a multi-task Chinese bias evaluation benchmark, addressing the lack of culturally relevant and comprehensive bias evaluation datasets for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluation datasets are English-centric and lack applicability to other cultures, especially Chinese. They also lack multi-task evaluation capabilities.

Method: Developed McBE with 4,077 instances, 12 bias categories, 82 subcategories, and 5 evaluation tasks to assess LLMs.

Result: Evaluated popular LLMs, revealing varying degrees of bias.

Conclusion: McBE provides a comprehensive tool for bias evaluation in LLMs, offering insights into cultural and multi-task bias assessment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs for dialogue summarization, finding stepwise reasoning often reduces quality by causing verbosity and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue summarization is valuable for customer service, meetings, and conversational AI, but the impact of reasoning architectures like Long CoT remains unexplored.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs across generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented summarization, using benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, QMSum) and advanced metrics.

Result: Stepwise reasoning does not consistently improve summarization; reasoning LLMs often produce verbose, inconsistent, and less concise summaries.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have limitations for dialogue summarization, requiring targeted modeling and evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

TL;DR: The paper investigates latent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, finding limited interpretable evidence and probing inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether latent CoT reasoning emerges in Huginn-3.5B, a recurrent Transformer, and assess its efficiency compared to externalized reasoning.

Method: Probing techniques like Logit Lens and Coda Lens are used to analyze internal behavior on arithmetic tasks, tracking rank trajectories of tokens.

Result: Limited interpretable latent CoT is found, with probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks and marginal gains from increased recurrence depth.

Conclusion: Latent CoT in Huginn-3.5B is less effective than explicit externalized reasoning, with interpretability heavily dependent on layer and decoding method.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle with complex cohort creation in GDC due to numerous fields; natural language input could simplify this.

Method: Developed GDC Cohort Copilot with locally-served LLMs to generate and refine cohort filters from natural language.

Result: The open-source GDC Cohort LLM outperformed GPT-4o in generating accurate cohorts.

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot enhances cohort creation efficiency and accessibility in GDC.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially

  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling infinitely long documents efficiently without performance degradation is a key challenge in long-text processing.

Method: Introduces MemAgent, which processes text in segments and updates memory with an overwrite strategy, extending the DAPO algorithm for training.

Result: Achieves <5% performance loss on a 3.5M QA task and >95% on a 512K RULER test, demonstrating strong extrapolation capabilities.

Conclusion: MemAgent effectively addresses long-text processing challenges with scalable performance.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

*Dohoon Kim,Donghun Kang,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DoMIX introduces a novel approach to continual Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) using LoRA modules, addressing computational cost, domain order sensitivity, and task-specific model needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual DAP methods are computationally expensive, sensitive to data order, and lack task-specific adaptability.

Method: Leverages LoRA modules for efficient, parallel, and order-robust domain-adaptive pre-training, tailored for specific tasks.

Result: DoMIX provides efficient, adaptable pre-trained models and extends to standard LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DoMIX successfully overcomes limitations of continual DAP, offering a scalable and task-specific solution.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.

*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT replaces classical FFN layers in BERT with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters and better data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFNs dominate parameter count in Transformers; PQCs offer a parameter-efficient alternative with potential for enhanced expressibility.

Method: Hybrid quantum-classical transformer with PQC-based FFN layers, featuring residual connections, RY/RZ rotations, and alternating entanglement for stability.

Result: QFFN-BERT achieves 102% baseline accuracy, reduces FFN parameters by 99%, and excels in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: PQCs, when co-designed with deep learning principles, are powerful and efficient alternatives to classical FFNs.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods prioritize data quantity over quality, reducing training efficiency. The goal is to enhance both efficiency and performance by focusing on high-quality data selection.

Method: Introduces a parametric model for code data selection, optimizing for distribution consistency and diversity to ensure high-quality data.

Result: Achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over a 92K baseline using only 10K samples, outperforming other sampling methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively boosts model performance while reducing computational costs, highlighting the importance of data quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks seven Akan ASR models using diverse speech datasets, revealing domain dependency and distinct error behaviors between Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating ASR model generalization across diverse speech contexts, particularly for low-resource languages like Akan.

Method: Seven Akan ASR models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2) were tested on four diverse Akan speech corpora, measuring word and character error rates.

Result: Models performed best within their training domains but degraded in mismatched scenarios. Whisper produced fluent but misleading errors, while Wav2Vec2 yielded obvious but less interpretable errors.

Conclusion: Targeted domain adaptation, adaptive routing, and multilingual training are needed for Akan and other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

TL;DR: WebSailor introduces a post-training method to enhance LLMs' ability to handle high-uncertainty tasks, matching proprietary models like DeepResearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in open-source LLMs' ability to systematically reduce uncertainty in complex information-seeking tasks.

Method: Uses structured sampling, information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and the Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO) algorithm.

Result: WebSailor outperforms open-source agents and matches proprietary agents in complex tasks.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively bridges the capability gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of label variation (LV) in supervised learning, emphasizing human label variation (HLV) as an informative signal. It critiques active learning (AL) assumptions and proposes a framework for HLV-aware AL, including LLM integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label variation is common but often treated as noise, overlooking HLV's value. AL assumptions rarely account for HLV, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: The paper decomposes LV into signal (HLV) and noise, surveys AL and LV literature, and proposes a conceptual framework for HLV-aware AL, including LLM use.

Result: A framework is introduced to integrate HLV into AL, addressing instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for HLV-aware AL, better reflecting real-world annotation complexities and leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF is a posttraining alignment framework for LLMs that mitigates bias by leveraging multiperspective generations and interpretable baselines, achieving alignment with minimal KL divergence and calibration error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable and interpretable bias mitigation in LLMs without extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Method: Uses the SAGED pipeline to construct bias benchmarks and decompose baselines into interpretable components, guiding generation through weighted sampling.

Result: Aligns LLM outputs with counterfactual and biased baselines, reducing KL divergence and calibration error while generalizing to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF provides a scalable, interpretable solution for bias mitigation in deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LimitGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to assist peer review by identifying limitations in scientific papers, using synthetic and human-written datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of publications makes peer review challenging, and LLMs' potential to assist in identifying limitations is understudied.

Method: Developed LimitGen benchmark with synthetic (LimitGen-Syn) and human-written (LimitGen-Human) datasets, augmented with literature retrieval for grounding.

Result: Enhanced LLM systems' capability to generate concrete and constructive feedback on paper limitations.

Conclusion: LimitGen improves LLMs' utility in peer review, offering early-stage feedback and complementing human efforts.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper measures the 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD) in vowel mimicry, finding it ranges between 14-51 mels in F1 X F2 space, impacting theories of speech production and vowel system structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the accuracy of sub-phonemic control in vowel production by quantifying how far apart two vowel stimuli must be for reliably different imitations.

Method: Uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to measure JPD among English speakers during front vowel production.

Result: JPD is estimated at 14-51 mels in F1 X F2 space.

Conclusion: The findings influence episodic speech production theories and set a lower bound for vowel phoneme proximity in formant space, explaining trends in vowel system structures.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit a 'Self-Correction Blind Spot'—failing to correct their own errors despite identifying them in user inputs. A framework (Self-Correction Bench) reveals a 64.5% blind spot rate, linked to training data. Adding 'Wait' reduces blind spots by 89.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study why LLMs fail to self-correct errors in their outputs despite identifying them in user inputs, aiming to improve reliability.

Method: Introduced Self-Correction Bench, a framework with controlled error injection at three complexity levels, tested on 14 models.

Result: Found a 64.5% average blind spot rate; adding 'Wait' reduced blind spots by 89.3%.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical LLM limitation and suggests training data adjustments to improve self-correction and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMs with reasoning capabilities (CoT or fine-tuned) are more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning capabilities in RLMs affect their robustness to social biases and whether reasoning mechanisms inadvertently increase bias vulnerability.

Method: Evaluated RLMs using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, employing LLM-as-a-judge for safety scoring and jailbreak techniques to test safety mechanisms.

Result: Reasoning-enabled models (CoT or fine-tuned) are more prone to bias elicitation, with CoT prompting being especially vulnerable to contextual reframing attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning design in RLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

*Wenhao Shi,Zhiqiang Hu,Yi Bin,Yang Yang,See-Kiong Ng,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MathV-DP, a dataset with diverse solution trajectories for image-question pairs, and Qwen-VL-DP, a model fine-tuned with supervised learning and enhanced by GRPO, improving accuracy and diversity in multimodal mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for mathematical reasoning lack diversity in reasoning perspectives and internal reflections, relying on one-to-one image-text pairs and single-solution supervision.

Method: The authors propose MathV-DP for diverse reasoning supervision and Qwen-VL-DP, a model fine-tuned with supervised learning and GRPO, integrating correctness discrimination and diversity-aware rewards.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP outperforms prior MLLMs in accuracy and generative diversity on MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse perspectives and reflective reasoning significantly enhances multimodal mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

*Wencheng Zhang,Shiqin Qiao,Lingjie Luo,Yinfeng Li,Chuanyang Zheng,Qian Xu,Meng Li,Yong Gui,Yijun He,Jianing Qiu,Jindong Hong,Jiankai Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynapseRoute dynamically routes queries to cost-efficient 'non-thinking' or high-reasoning 'thinking' modes, improving accuracy and reducing costs in medical question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing performance and operational cost in LLMs, especially for medical questions, where many queries don't require high-cost reasoning.

Method: Proposes SynapseRoute, a ML-based framework for routing queries to 'thinking' or 'non-thinking' modes based on complexity.

Result: Improves accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduces inference time by 36.8%, and token consumption by 39.66%. Avoids over-reasoning pitfalls.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing optimizes accuracy, cost, and latency, validated by the AIT index for trade-off evaluation.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

### [137] [Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02833)
*Valentina Pyatkin,Saumya Malik,Victoria Graf,Hamish Ivison,Shengyi Huang,Pradeep Dasigi,Nathan Lambert,Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI models' ability to generalize precise instruction following, and proposes RLVR to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with generalizing precise instruction following, especially for unseen constraints.

Method: Developed IFBench with 58 diverse constraints, designed verification modules, and used RLVR for training.

Result: RLVR significantly improves models' ability to follow precise instructions.

Conclusion: The work provides tools and insights for enhancing precise instruction following in AI models.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

### [138] [LLM Hypnosis: Exploiting User Feedback for Unauthorized Knowledge Injection to All Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02850)
*Almog Hilel,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user feedback allows a single user to persistently alter LM knowledge and behavior by manipulating prompts and feedback (upvotes/downvotes).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how user feedback can be exploited to manipulate LM outputs, revealing risks in preference tuning.

Method: Attackers prompt LMs to output poisoned or benign responses, then manipulate feedback (upvoting poisoned or downvoting benign outputs) to influence future behavior.

Result: The attack successfully inserts false knowledge, modifies code generation to introduce security flaws, and injects fake financial news.

Conclusion: The study highlights a new vulnerability in preference tuning, showing fine-grained control over LM behavior and extending known attack mechanisms.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

### [139] [MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02851)
*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOTIF is a reinforcement learning method enabling LLMs to reason modularly beyond context size limits, improving accuracy on benchmarks with sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The context size limit of LLMs restricts reasoning with large token sets, necessitating a modular approach.

Method: Proposed MOTIF, an RL training method for multi-round thinking token generation, tested on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct using GSM8K.

Result: Achieved 3.8% and 3.3% accuracy improvements on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks with 15% sample efficiency.

Conclusion: MOTIF enhances LLM reasoning beyond context limits efficiently, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and
https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.

### [140] [Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856)
*Nikhil Chandak,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Moritz Hardt,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques multiple choice benchmarks for language model evaluation, proposing generative evaluation via answer matching as a more reliable alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multiple choice benchmarks, which can be answered without understanding the question, and to explore scalable alternatives like generative evaluation.

Method: Introduces answer matching: models generate free-form responses, which are evaluated using a modern language model to match reference answers. Human grading data from MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond is used to compare evaluation strategies.

Result: Answer matching achieves near-perfect agreement with human grading, outperforming multiple choice and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Model rankings change significantly with answer matching.

Conclusion: The paper advocates shifting from multiple choice to answer matching for more accurate and scalable language model evaluation.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

### [141] [Learnable-Differentiable Finite Volume Solver for Accelerated Simulation of Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01975)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDSolver, a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, efficiently simulates fluid flows on coarse grids, outperforming baselines with high accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical solvers are computationally expensive, while machine learning methods lack interpretability and generalizability. LDSolver addresses these gaps.

Method: LDSolver combines a differentiable finite volume solver with a learnable module for flux approximation and temporal error correction on coarse grids.

Result: LDSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance on various flow systems, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: LDSolver offers an efficient, accurate, and generalizable solution for fluid flow simulations, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

*Siqing Long,Xiangzhi Huang,Jiemin Xie,Ming Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DKGCM, a graph convolutional network for accurate spatiotemporal traffic demand forecasting, using DK-GCN for spatial dependencies and FFT with bidirectional Mamba for temporal dependencies, enhanced by GRPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving traffic demand forecasting accuracy to optimize resource allocation and utilization efficiency by addressing complex spatiotemporal relationships.

Method: Uses DK-GCN (Dynamic Time Warping and K-means clustering) for spatial dependencies, integrates FFT with bidirectional Mamba for temporal dependencies, and employs GRPO reinforcement learning for training optimization.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods on three public datasets.

Conclusion: DKGCM effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies, enhancing traffic demand forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores multimodal feature combinations (text, images, social features) for misinformation detection, showing improved performance over unimodal/bimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in research on multimodal misinformation detection, especially during elections and crises like COVID-19.

Method: Analyzed 1,529 tweets with text and images, enriched with social and visual features (e.g., OCR, object detection), using early fusion and machine learning.

Result: Combining unsupervised and supervised models improved classification by 15% over unimodal and 5% over bimodal models. Misinformation propagation patterns were also analyzed.

Conclusion: Multimodal feature integration enhances misinformation detection, with social and visual features playing key roles.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

*Hexiang Bai,Deyu Li,Jiye Liang,Yanhui Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new feature selection method for massive data using sampling and rough set theory, ensuring high discriminatory ability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent machines lack computing resources for feature selection in massive datasets, necessitating an efficient method.

Method: Uses sampling techniques and rough set theory, measuring discriminatory ability via discernible object pairs, and constructs positive region preserved samples.

Result: Proposed method efficiently selects feature subsets with high discriminatory ability, validated on 11 datasets, including large-scale ones.

Conclusion: The method is effective for feature selection in massive data, offering fast approximate reducts with guaranteed discriminatory ability.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

*Bappaditya Dey,Daniel Sorensen,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing using image-based MTS data and Siamese networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in semiconductor fabrication include high data dimensionality, class imbalance, noisy data, and complex interdependencies, requiring advanced anomaly detection methods.

Method: Convert MTS data to image representations using CWT, fine-tune VGG-16 for classification, and use a Siamese network for anomaly detection by comparing embeddings.

Result: High accuracy in identifying anomalies on real FAB process data, suitable for offline detection in supervised or semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and flexible for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Chain of Thought improves video question-answering by iteratively selecting relevant frames, outperforming standard methods on long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video understanding is challenging for VLMs due to irrelevant distractors in long context windows.

Method: Uses the VLM to iteratively identify and extract the most relevant frames for answering questions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on 4 datasets, with a 2.8-point improvement on 1-hour videos in LVBench.

Conclusion: Leveraging computation for context selection at inference-time enhances VLM performance on long videos.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRES is a co-designed algorithm-system solution for accelerating out-of-core SpGEMM in GCNs, addressing data alignment and memory bottlenecks, and achieving 1.8x lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current out-of-core SpGEMM systems for GCNs suffer from high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization due to sparse format data alignment and memory allocation issues.

Method: AIRES introduces block-level data alignment for sparse matrices and a tiling algorithm for row block-wise alignment. System-wise, it uses a three-phase dynamic scheduler with dual-way data transfer across GPU memory, GDS, and host memory.

Result: AIRES achieves up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AIRES effectively addresses the performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM for GCNs, offering significant improvements in latency and throughput.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: GeoAda is an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework for fine-tuning geometric diffusion models efficiently without altering their architecture, preserving geometric consistency and avoiding overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently fine-tuning geometric diffusion models for downstream tasks with varying geometric controls is underexplored.

Method: GeoAda uses a structured adapter design: encoding control signals, processing them with trainable copies of pretrained layers, and projecting back via decoupling operators and equivariant convolution.

Result: GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, preserving original task accuracy and avoiding overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: GeoAda is widely applicable, maintains SE(3)-equivariance, and outperforms baselines in diverse geometric control tasks.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about accuracy and algorithmic bias in using LLMs for hiring, and to demonstrate the advantages of domain-specific models over general-purpose LLMs.

Method: Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs and Match Score using predictive accuracy metrics (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness metrics (impact ratio across demographic groups) on 10,000 real-world candidate-job pairs.

Result: Match Score outperforms general-purpose LLMs in accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and fairness (minimum race-wise impact ratio 0.957 vs 0.809 or lower for LLMs).

Conclusion: Domain-specific models like Match Score can achieve both accuracy and fairness in hiring, while general-purpose LLMs require extensive safeguards to mitigate biases.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EBTs (Energy-Based Transformers) generalize System 2 Thinking by learning to verify input-prediction compatibility, outperforming existing methods in scaling and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize System 2 Thinking approaches without modality or problem-specific constraints or additional supervision.

Method: Train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) to assign energy values to input-prediction pairs, enabling predictions via gradient descent-based energy minimization.

Result: EBTs scale faster (35% higher rate) and outperform Transformer++ (29% better on language tasks) and Diffusion Transformers (better image denoising).

Conclusion: EBTs offer a promising paradigm for scaling model learning and thinking capabilities, generalizing better than existing approaches.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently train end-to-end guitar amp models with minimal data by leveraging active learning.

Method: Uses a WaveNet-like architecture and gradient-based optimization to determine optimal datapoints (amp knob settings) for sampling.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness under constrained sample counts, optimizing data usage.

Conclusion: PANAMA successfully reduces the required data for training guitar amp models while maintaining performance.

Abstract: We introduce PANAMA, an active learning framework for the training of
end-to-end parametric guitar amp models using a WaveNet-like architecture. With
\model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples that are determined
by an active learning strategy to use a minimum amount of datapoints (i.e., amp
knob settings). We show that gradient-based optimization algorithms can be used
to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks trained with optimal compute exhibit universal loss curves, collapsing onto a single curve when normalized, termed 'supercollapse', observed across architectures and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the scaling limits and universality in neural network training dynamics as model size and training time increase together.

Method: Analyze loss curves of models trained with varying sizes, learning rate schedules, and datasets, focusing on normalization and collapse phenomena.

Result: Loss curves collapse onto a universal curve when normalized, with supercollapse occurring under optimal hyperparameter scaling, breaking down otherwise.

Conclusion: Supercollapse serves as a precise indicator of good scaling, explained by power-law structure in neural scaling laws and SGD noise dynamics.

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

TL;DR: CROP is an LLM-powered framework for automatic VLSI design flow tuning, improving efficiency and reducing power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual parameter selection in VLSI design is laborious and limited by expertise, necessitating automation.

Method: CROP uses RTL-to-vector transformation, embedding-based retrieval, and RAG-enhanced LLM-guided parameter search.

Result: Achieves 9.9% power reduction and superior QoR with fewer iterations.

Conclusion: CROP effectively automates and optimizes VLSI design tuning.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

*Xiao Li,Liangji Zhu,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent diffusion framework combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model improves compression ratios and reconstruction accuracy for spatiotemporal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models lack controllability and reconstruction accuracy for practical data compression applications.

Method: Proposes a latent diffusion framework using keyframes in latent space for generative interpolation, reducing storage needs.

Result: Achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios than SZ3 and 63% better performance than learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in generative models for practical data compression.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

*Tuo Wang,Jian Kang,Yujun Yan,Adithya Kulkarni,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCPNET introduces a conformal prediction framework for temporal GNNs, addressing exchangeability violations in dynamic graphs and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods for GNNs focus on static graphs, ignoring temporal dependencies, which limits their applicability in real-world dynamic scenarios.

Method: NCPNET uses a diffusion-based non-conformity score to capture topological and temporal uncertainties and includes an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets (WIKI, REDDIT, DBLP, IBM AML) show NCPNET ensures coverage and reduces prediction set size by up to 31%.

Conclusion: NCPNET effectively extends conformal prediction to temporal graphs, improving reliability and efficiency in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety failures in ML models when predictions don't account for how individuals can change their inputs, especially in critical settings like hiring or lending.

Method: Introduces a validation procedure framing responsiveness as sensitivity analysis, with constraints on interventions and distributions over effects. Uses black-box access to estimate responsiveness for any model/dataset.

Result: Develops algorithms to uniformly sample reachable points, enabling tasks like falsification and failure probability estimation. Demonstrated in recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Conclusion: The procedure enhances model safety by validating responsiveness to interventions, applicable across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A workflow to reduce bias in dimensionality reduction (DR) evaluation by clustering correlated metrics and selecting representatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR evaluation metrics can be biased if highly correlated metrics are selected, favoring techniques emphasizing certain characteristics.

Method: Cluster metrics based on empirical correlations, minimize overlap, and select a representative from each cluster.

Result: The workflow improves the stability of DR evaluation, mitigating bias.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively reduces evaluation bias in DR projections.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect is a training-free framework that corrects neural network predictions for PDEs by enforcing PDE consistency, reducing errors by up to 100x with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks for PDEs suffer from error accumulation in long-term rollouts, leading to divergence from valid solutions.

Method: PhysicsCorrect formulates correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals, using an efficient caching strategy to precompute Jacobians.

Result: The framework reduces errors by up to 100x across Navier-Stokes, wave equations, and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems, adding under 5% inference time.

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect stabilizes neural surrogates, combining deep learning efficiency with physical fidelity for practical applications.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

TL;DR: VERBA uses LLMs to automate pairwise model comparisons, improving transparency and reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of navigating and selecting from numerous similar-performing models by providing fine-grained pairwise comparisons.

Method: Leverages LLMs to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from pairs of models, with a protocol to evaluate informativeness.

Result: Achieves up to 80% accuracy in verbalizing differences, improving to 90% with structural information.

Conclusion: VERBA enhances model transparency and comparability, enabling better model selection and understanding.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy for ride-hailing providers, integrating Fast Competition Adaptation and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment to optimize coupons under budget constraints. It also introduces RideGym, a simulation environment for strategy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competitive ranking mechanism on ride-hailing platforms incentivizes providers to lower fares, creating a need for dynamic coupon strategies to optimize order acquisition under budget constraints, a challenge not well-addressed in existing research.

Method: The FCA-RL framework combines Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) for dynamic price response and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA) for budget-constrained coupon optimization. RideGym, a simulation environment, is introduced for strategy evaluation.

Result: FCA-RL outperforms baseline methods across diverse market conditions, demonstrating effectiveness in subsidy optimization for ride-hailing providers.

Conclusion: The proposed FCA-RL framework and RideGym simulation environment effectively address the challenge of dynamic coupon strategy optimization in ride-hailing markets, offering superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in conventional reward engineering, such as inefficiencies and suboptimal performance of LLMs in numerical optimization, motivate the need for a better framework.

Method: URDP uses self-consistency analysis to quantify reward function uncertainty, introduces UABO for hyperparameter tuning, and employs a bi-level optimization architecture.

Result: URDP generates higher-quality reward functions and improves efficiency across 35 tasks in three benchmark environments.

Conclusion: URDP effectively combines LLMs and Bayesian optimization, enhancing automated reward design in RL.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of interpretability and generalization in data-driven semantic communication, especially for unseen data.

Method: Uses a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB) to align semantic features and enable reasoning for unseen cases, leveraging zero-shot learning (ZSL) for classification.

Result: Simulations on APY datasets show KGZS-SC outperforms existing frameworks in classifying unseen categories across SNR levels.

Conclusion: KGZS-SC enhances generalization and efficiency, reducing communication overhead and improving adaptability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR), a lightweight method for continual learning under concept drift, outperforming Full Relearning (FR) with reduced computational and annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning methods assume static data distributions, ignoring real-world concept drift. This work addresses the need for stability and adaptation in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes AMR, which updates the replay buffer by removing outdated samples and adding new ones, aligning memory with drifted distributions. Introduces concept-drift variants of standard benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: AMR matches FR's performance while significantly reducing labeled data and computational needs. It maintains high accuracy in non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: AMR is a scalable solution for continual learning under concept drift, balancing stability and plasticity effectively.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

*Sooyeon Kim,Giung Nam,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-distillation improves constrained text generation by aligning the base model with the target distribution, overcoming sparse reward challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning in constrained text generation where target distributions are unlikely under the base model, leading to sparse rewards.

Method: Iterative refinement of the base model through self-distillation to progressively align it with the target distribution.

Result: Substantial gains in generation quality by making the model more aligned with the target.

Conclusion: Self-distillation effectively enhances constrained text generation by mitigating sparse reward issues.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To summarize the latest advancements and applications of Transformer models in EEG decoding for BCIs/BMIs.

Method: Review and organize research on Transformer architectures, including hybrid models and customized variants, for EEG processing.

Result: Identifies key trends, benefits, and limitations of Transformers in EEG decoding.

Conclusion: Transformers show promise in EEG decoding, but challenges remain; future research directions are outlined.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

*Changhun Kim,Yechan Mun,Sangchul Hahn,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeltaSHAP is a novel XAI algorithm for online patient monitoring, addressing clinical needs by explaining prediction changes, providing feature attribution details, and operating in real time. It outperforms existing methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods fail to meet clinical needs for explaining patient risk evolution in real time, requiring a tailored solution.

Method: DeltaSHAP adapts Shapley values for temporal settings, focusing on observed feature combinations for efficient, real-time explanations.

Result: DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 62% in explanation quality and reduces computation time by 33% on the MIMIC-III benchmark.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP is effective for clinical time series explanation, offering real-time insights and improved performance over existing XAI methods.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

### [168] [Offline Reinforcement Learning with Penalized Action Noise Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02356)
*JunHyeok Oh,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANI enhances offline RL by noise-injected actions, covering the action space while penalizing noise, outperforming complex methods like diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL's generalization is limited; diffusion models improve performance but are computationally expensive. PANI offers a simpler alternative.

Method: PANI injects noise into actions during offline learning, penalizing noise to balance exploration and performance. It modifies the MDP framework.

Result: PANI improves performance across benchmarks, proving effective without the computational cost of diffusion models.

Conclusion: PANI is a simple, efficient alternative to diffusion models for offline RL, with strong theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing equalizer parameters for signal integrity in high-speed DRAM systems is computationally demanding and model-reliant, necessitating a more efficient and model-free approach.

Method: The framework employs learned latent signal representations for fast signal integrity evaluation and a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent for parameter optimization.

Result: Achieved 42.7% and 36.8% improvements in eye-opening window area for different equalizer configurations, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The method offers superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization, with key contributions in latent signal metrics and model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

*Caio Azevedo,Lina Achaji,Stefano Sabatini,Nicola Poerio,Grzegorz Bartyzel,Sascha Hornauer,Fabien Moutarde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning trajectory prediction models using preference optimization to improve scene consistency in multi-agent settings without sacrificing accuracy or adding computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models struggle with capturing interdependencies between agents in complex scenarios, leading to inconsistent predictions.

Method: The work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models using preference optimization, leveraging automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show significant improvement in scene consistency with minimal loss in prediction accuracy and no added computational cost at inference.

Conclusion: Incorporating preference optimization enhances the consistency of trajectory predictions in multi-agent scenarios effectively.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

*Zihan Tan,Suyuan Huang,Guancheng Wan,Wenke Huang,He Li,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2FGL addresses spatial and spectral challenges in Federated Graph Learning by combining a global knowledge repository and frequency alignment, improving global GNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subgraph-FL methods neglect signal propagation in spatial and spectral domains, leading to degraded global GNN performance and client drifts.

Method: Proposes S2FGL, a framework with a global knowledge repository for label signal disruption and frequency alignment for spectral heterogeneity.

Result: Extensive experiments show S2FGL's superiority in addressing spatial and spectral challenges.

Conclusion: S2FGL effectively mitigates label signal disruption and spectral client drifts, enhancing global GNN generalizability.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

*Francesco Alesiani,Henrik Christiansen,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfinityKAN adaptively learns bases for univariate functions in KANs, treating hyperparameters as part of training via variational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ad-hoc choice of bases in KANs limits their applicability; InfinityKAN aims to automate this process.

Method: Uses variational inference and backpropagation to learn an infinite number of bases adaptively.

Result: Extends KANs' applicability by integrating hyperparameter learning into training.

Conclusion: InfinityKAN enhances KANs by automating basis selection, making them more practical for representation learning.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

### [173] [Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02496)
*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online conformal prediction, optimizing efficiency while maintaining coverage for arbitrary and exchangeable sequences, revealing a gap between the two settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of constructing efficient confidence intervals in an online setting, balancing coverage and interval length.

Method: Proposes algorithms for arbitrary and exchangeable sequences, analyzing their performance in terms of coverage and efficiency.

Result: For exchangeable sequences, near-optimal coverage and length are achieved. For arbitrary sequences, a tradeoff between efficiency and mistakes is shown, with a matching algorithm provided.

Conclusion: The study highlights a gap between exchangeable and arbitrary settings, demonstrating no single algorithm can be optimal for both, and provides a near-optimal solution.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

TL;DR: GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) improves continual learning in LLMs by combining full and low-rank parameters, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness in continual fine-tuning of LLMs, overcoming LoRA's limitations.

Method: Combines full and low-rank parameters, updating within a unified low-rank gradient subspace to expand optimization space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on continual learning benchmarks, mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: GORP offers an efficient and effective solution for continual learning in LLMs.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

TL;DR: A novel approach enhances cross-subject motor imagery classification using optimized preprocessing and deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of variability in EEG patterns across individuals to improve calibration-free BCIs for real-world applications.

Method: Direct classification of STFT-transformed EEG data with optimized parameters and balanced batching in CNN training.

Result: Achieved 67.60% (IV-1), 65.96% (IV-2A), and 80.22% (IV-2B) accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification and provides a robust open-access dataset.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

TL;DR: RetrySQL introduces a self-correcting training approach for text-to-SQL models, improving accuracy by 4 percentage points through corrupted and corrected reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of SQL-specific generative models and unexplored potential of self-correcting strategies in text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: Corrupting reference SQL queries to create retry data, then continuously pre-training an open-source coding model with this data.

Result: 4 percentage point improvement in execution accuracy; full-parameter pre-training is necessary, unlike LoRA.

Conclusion: RetrySQL proves self-correction can be learned, enhancing SQL generation accuracy competitively against larger proprietary models.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

*David A. Danhofer,Davide D'Ascenzo,Rafael Dubach,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs succeed due to their ability to exploit compositional sparsity in target functions, a property shared by all efficiently computable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental principles behind DNNs' success, particularly their ability to leverage compositional sparsity.

Method: Argues that DNNs exploit the compositional sparsity of target functions, where functions are built from low-dimensional subsets of inputs.

Result: Identifies compositional sparsity as a key factor in DNNs' success, linking it to efficiently computable functions.

Conclusion: Further research on compositional sparsity is crucial for a complete theory of deep learning and intelligence.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LN layers in GPT-2 can be removed with minimal performance loss, enabling better interpretability without compromising model functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of LN layers in inference and improve mechanistic interpretability of transformer models.

Method: Remove LN layers from GPT-2 models, measure validation loss, and test interpretability techniques on LN-free models.

Result: LN removal causes only a small increase in loss (+0.03 for GPT-2 XL). Interpretability improves, but attribution patching accuracy remains unchanged.

Conclusion: LN is not essential for GPT-2's functionality, and LN-free models facilitate more precise interpretability research.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance DBNs' scalability and efficiency while maintaining accuracy, addressing limitations of earlier designs.

Method: Extends DBNs with a differentiable interconnect and proposes two pruning stages: SAT-based logic equivalence and similarity-based data-driven pruning.

Result: The approach allows DBNs to scale to wider layers, reduces model size, and offers better compression-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The extended DBNs with pruning techniques improve scalability and efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fault diagnosis in induction machines by leveraging advanced nonlinear neuron architectures like PadéNets.

Method: Comparison of one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and PadéNets using vibration and acoustic data from induction motor datasets.

Result: PadéNets achieved higher diagnostic accuracies (up to 99.96%) compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: PadéNets' enhanced nonlinearity and compatibility with unbounded activation functions significantly improve fault diagnosis performance.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in

While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition

  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft is a unified framework enabling a single draft model to work with any target model, addressing cross-vocabulary mismatches and improving decoding speed via adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in online deployment include incompatible draft-target models and latency expectations. OmniDraft aims for a "one drafter for all" solution.

Method: Uses an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning and adaptive drafting techniques.

Result: Achieves 1.5-2x speedup, works with diverse target models (Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B, Llama3-8B).

Conclusion: OmniDraft is effective for on-device LLM applications, offering efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

### [182] [Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02608)
*François Rozet,Ruben Ohana,Michael McCabe,Gilles Louppe,François Lanusse,Shirley Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent-space diffusion models for dynamical systems emulation show robust accuracy at high compression rates (up to 1000x) and outperform non-generative methods in accuracy and prediction diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive at inference, limiting their use as fast physics emulators. This work explores whether latent-space emulation, like in image/video generation, can address this issue for dynamical systems.

Method: The study applies latent-space diffusion models to dynamical systems, testing their robustness to compression rates (up to 1000x) and comparing them to non-generative methods. It also examines practical design choices like architectures and optimizers.

Result: Latent-space emulation remains accurate even at high compression rates (1000x). Diffusion-based emulators are more accurate and diverse than non-generative counterparts.

Conclusion: Latent-space diffusion models are effective for dynamical systems emulation, offering accuracy and diversity, with practical design choices being crucial for training.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

### [183] [L-VAE: Variational Auto-Encoder with Learnable Beta for Disentangled Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02619)
*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE is a novel model that learns disentangled representations and hyperparameters of the cost function, improving upon β-VAE by dynamically balancing reconstruction and disentanglement losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of β-VAE, which requires empirical adjustment of hyperparameters, by learning them automatically and balancing reconstruction and disentanglement losses.

Method: L-VAE learns the weights of loss terms and model parameters concurrently, adding a regularization term to prevent bias.

Result: L-VAE achieves effective balance between reconstruction and disentanglement, outperforming or matching other VAEs on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: L-VAE successfully disentangles latent dimensions and facial attributes, proving its effectiveness over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

*Antoine Honoré,Borja Rodríguez Gálvez,Yoomi Park,Yitian Zhou,Volker M. Lauschke,Ming Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, using fewer parameters and less computation. Incorporating AlphaFold structures further improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VEPs rely on MSAs, which may not fit pharmacogenes with low evolutionary pressure. DMS datasets offer an alternative with quantitative fitness scores.

Method: Proposed matVAE with a structured prior, evaluated on 33 DMS datasets from ProteinGym. Compared matVAE-MSA and matENC-DMS, and integrated AlphaFold structures.

Result: matVAE-MSA outperforms DeepSequence in zero-shot prediction. matENC-DMS excels in supervised tasks. AlphaFold integration matches DeepSequence's performance.

Conclusion: DMS datasets can replace MSAs without significant performance loss, encouraging further development and exploration of DMS data for variant effect prediction.

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

*Irena Girshovitz,Atai Ambus,Moni Shahar,Ran Gilad-Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Medical Data Pecking approach, adapting software engineering concepts to assess EHR data quality, and demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data quality issues hinder reliable epidemiological and AI research, necessitating systematic assessment methods.

Method: Uses the Medical Data Pecking Tool (MDPT) with automated test generation (via LLMs) and a testing framework to identify data errors.

Result: MDPT identified 20-43 data issues across three datasets, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach improves EHR data quality assessment, with potential for further enhancements in grounding and modalities.

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

### [186] [High-Order Deep Meta-Learning with Category-Theoretic Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02634)
*David H. Mguni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical deep learning framework for meta-learning enables neural networks to generalize across task hierarchies by generating virtual tasks and learning soft constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of human-generated data and enhance generalization by autonomously creating informative tasks and constraints.

Method: Uses a generative mechanism to create virtual tasks, iteratively refining constraints and exploring task landscapes. Hierarchical meta-learning is framed using category-theoretic functors.

Result: Produces novel tasks, enhances inductive biases, and supports structured, interpretable learning progression.

Conclusion: The framework advances meta-learning towards general AI by enabling autonomous task generation and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExPO is a new RL post-training method that generates effective positive samples by conditioning on ground-truth answers, improving reasoning performance in challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-style post-training methods rely on initial model outputs, limiting their ability to solve problems where the model initially fails.

Method: ExPO generates positive samples likely under the current policy and aligned with correct answers, enabling better exploration.

Result: ExPO outperforms expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging reasoning tasks like MATH level-5.

Conclusion: ExPO offers a modular and effective solution for improving reasoning in RL post-training, especially in difficult settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

*Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-efficient reinforcement learning method using information-theoretic exploration bonuses targeting epistemic uncertainty, with theoretical guarantees and practical approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by focusing on intrinsic motivation and epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Proposes Predictive Trajectory Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE), integrating model-based planning and information-theoretic bonuses. Uses sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels, and Deep Ensemble models for approximations.

Result: PTS-BE outperforms baselines in environments with sparse rewards or purely exploratory tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical grounding for IG-based approaches and demonstrates practical efficacy through PTS-BE.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAID, a framework addressing the trade-off between fairness and generalization in deepfake detection by controlling confounders and employing demographic-aware interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflicting objectives of generalization and fairness in deepfake detection by uncovering their causal relationship.

Method: Proposes DAID with demographic-aware data rebalancing and demographic-agnostic feature aggregation to neutralize biases and suppress sensitive attributes.

Result: DAID outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in fairness and generalization across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAID effectively balances fairness and generalization, validated by theoretical and practical results.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: A guided discrete diffusion model is introduced to optimize antibody sequences for developability, integrating a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module to enhance biophysical viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve antibody developability (manufacturability, stability, safety) for clinical effectiveness by leveraging computational methods.

Method: A guided discrete diffusion model trained on natural antibody sequences and developability data, enhanced by SVDD for biophysically viable sampling.

Result: The model reproduces natural repertoire features and enriches developability scores under SVDD guidance.

Conclusion: This framework enables iterative, ML-driven antibody design combining binding and biophysical criteria.

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

TL;DR: A method using Differentially Private (DP) generative models for decentralized medical imaging training, improving privacy, scalability, and efficiency over traditional Federated Learning (FL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and privacy regulations limit DL adoption in medical imaging. FL has high communication costs and lacks flexibility for multiple tasks.

Method: Proposes a DP-CVAE model for collaborative training, extracting compact embeddings to reduce redundancy and computational overhead.

Result: Outperforms traditional FL classifiers, ensures differential privacy, and produces higher-fidelity embeddings with fewer parameters than DP-CGAN.

Conclusion: The approach enhances privacy, scalability, and efficiency in medical imaging, supporting diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARL improves dynamic pricing in supply chains by modeling strategic interactions, outperforming static rule-based methods in competition but lagging in fairness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERP systems use static pricing, ignoring strategic interactions. MARL addresses this gap by modeling multi-agent dynamics.

Method: Evaluated MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static baselines in a simulated e-commerce environment with LightGBM demand prediction.

Result: Rule-based methods excel in fairness and stability but lack competition. MADQN is aggressive; MADDPG balances competition, fairness, and stability.

Conclusion: MARL captures emergent strategic behavior, offering insights for dynamic pricing beyond static rules.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new fluid democracy protocol (viscous-retained democracy) for federated learning to reduce wasteful data transfer costs and limit adversarial impact, outperforming traditional methods like FedAvg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize wasteful data transfer costs in federated learning by identifying the most useful client weights and addressing adversarial vulnerabilities in existing protocols.

Method: Introduces viscous-retained democracy, a new protocol that outperforms 1p1v (FedAvg) and limits adversarial influence. Also proposes FedVRD, an algorithm to dynamically mitigate adversaries while optimizing costs.

Result: The new protocol and algorithm improve efficiency by reducing unnecessary data transfers and enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Viscous-retained democracy and FedVRD offer a more efficient and secure approach to federated learning compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoG is a deep RL algorithm inspired by infantile amnesia, combining Experience Replay Decay and Network Expansion to improve sample efficiency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address primacy bias in deep RL, inspired by human memory processes like infantile amnesia.

Method: Introduces Experience Replay Decay (forgetting early experiences) and Network Expansion (adding parameters dynamically).

Result: Outperforms SoTA algorithms like BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2 on 40+ continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: FoG effectively mitigates primacy bias, enhancing RL performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

TL;DR: A framework integrating spatial, temporal, and network dependencies improves micromobility demand prediction by 27-49%, aiding fleet management and urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate demand prediction is crucial for managing dockless e-scooters, which enhance urban transport but require optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning.

Method: The study introduces a framework combining spatial, temporal, and network dependencies for micromobility demand forecasting.

Result: The framework outperforms baseline models, improving prediction accuracy by 27 to 49%.

Conclusion: The findings enable data-driven micromobility management, optimizing fleet distribution and supporting sustainable urban planning.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and

*Shiyi Liu,Buwen Liang,Yuetong Fang,Zixuan Jiang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIPPO is a hierarchical contrastive learning framework for protein-protein interaction prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance and zero-shot transferability across species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities and improving PPI prediction, especially in low-data or less characterized organisms.

Method: Uses hierarchical contrastive loss functions and multi-tiered biological representation matching to align protein sequences and hierarchical attributes.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, shows robustness in low-data regimes, and demonstrates zero-shot transferability to other species.

Conclusion: HIPPO advances cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

*Argimiro Arratia,Mahmoud El Daou,Henryk Gzyl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel entropy-based method for classification by searching for optimal parameters in a bounded hypercube, extending to polynomial surfaces for complex decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classification problem using hyperplanes is central to machine learning, but traditional methods like SVMs and gradient descent have limitations. The paper aims to provide a robust alternative.

Method: Proposes minimizing an entropy-based function to find parameters in a bounded hypercube and a positive vector, extending to polynomial surfaces for non-linear separability.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method's efficiency and versatility in handling diverse classification tasks, including linear and non-linear cases.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust alternative to traditional techniques, demonstrating effectiveness in both linear and non-linear classification problems.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

*Aurko Roy,Timothy Chou,Sai Surya Duvvuri,Sijia Chen,Jiecao Yu,Xiaodong Wang,Manzil Zaheer,Rohan Anil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the 2-simplicial Transformer, showing it improves token efficiency over standard Transformers, especially in tasks like math, coding, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws assume infinite data and compute-bound settings, but modern models rely on massive datasets, making token efficiency crucial.

Method: The 2-simplicial Transformer generalizes dot-product attention to trilinear functions, implemented via an efficient Triton kernel.

Result: The 2-simplicial Transformer outperforms standard Transformers in tasks like math and reasoning for a fixed token budget, altering scaling law exponents.

Conclusion: The 2-simplicial Transformer offers a more token-efficient architecture, addressing limitations of current scaling laws in data-rich settings.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

*Yixuan Zhang,Ruihao Zhu,Qiaomin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes contextual online pricing with biased offline data, identifying key factors like bias, data size, and dispersion that influence regret bounds. It proposes OFU policies for optimal performance and extends results to stochastic linear bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of contextual pricing with biased offline data, aiming to provide tight regret guarantees and improve upon purely online methods.

Method: Uses Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) policies for scalar and general price elasticity cases, and designs a robust variant for unknown bias.

Result: Achieves minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bounds for scalar elasticity and worst-case rates for general elasticity, with improved performance over online methods.

Conclusion: The work provides the first tight regret guarantees for contextual pricing with biased offline data, with techniques applicable to stochastic linear bandits.

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

### [200] [Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Recurrent Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782)
*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why recurrent models fail to generalize to longer sequences and proposes simple training interventions to improve length generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent models struggle with length generalization despite their theoretical capability to handle long sequences, due to limited exposure to all attainable states during training.

Method: The study combines empirical and theoretical analysis to support the unexplored states hypothesis and tests interventions like Gaussian noise initialization and state sharing.

Result: With minimal post-training steps, the interventions enable models to generalize to sequences orders of magnitude longer than training context, improving long-context performance.

Conclusion: Simple training interventions can efficiently enhance length generalization in recurrent models, making them more robust for long sequences.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

*Thiti Suttaket,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRADUATE is a survival analysis model ensuring multicalibration for all subpopulations, balancing calibration and discrimination, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival models are poorly calibrated for minority subpopulations, risking erroneous clinical decisions.

Method: GRADUATE frames multicalibration as constrained optimization, optimizing calibration and discrimination in-training.

Result: Empirical tests show GRADUATE outperforms baselines, with mathematical proof of near-optimal, feasible solutions.

Conclusion: GRADUATE effectively addresses calibration issues in survival analysis, improving reliability for all subpopulations.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

It develops new replicable algorithms and a methodology for lower bounds, addressing open questions in uniformity and closeness testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore distribution testing within algorithmic replicability, aiming to understand sample complexity for testing properties of distributions.

Method: Develops new replicable algorithms for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions and introduces a methodology for proving sample complexity lower bounds.

Result: Presents near-optimal sample complexity lower bounds for replicable uniformity and closeness testing, answering prior open questions.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of replicable distribution testing, providing algorithmic tools and lower bound techniques with broader applicability.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses biased treatment effect estimates due to discrepancies between structured training data and textual inference data, proposing a framework using LLMs and a doubly robust learner to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between structured training data and incomplete textual inference data in medicine leads to biased treatment effect estimates, necessitating a solution.

Method: A novel framework combining large language models (LLMs) and a custom doubly robust learner to account for inference time text confounding.

Result: The framework effectively mitigates biases caused by inference time text confounding, as demonstrated in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the inference time text confounding problem, improving treatment effect estimation in clinical practice.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

*Kunyu Zhang,Qiang Li,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MvHo-IB is a multi-view learning framework for fMRI data that models higher-order interactions (HOIs) to improve diagnostic accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher-order interactions (HOIs) in fMRI data can enhance diagnostic accuracy, but extracting and utilizing them effectively is challenging.

Method: MvHo-IB combines O-information and Renyi entropy to quantify HOIs, uses a Brain3DCNN encoder, and employs a multi-view learning information bottleneck.

Result: MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance on three fMRI datasets, surpassing hypergraph-based techniques.

Conclusion: MvHo-IB effectively models HOIs for improved diagnostic decision-making in fMRI analysis.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

*Xing Liu,Lizhuo Luo,Ming Tang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlowSpec is a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework for efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, improving speed by 1.36×-1.77× over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of pipeline-based approaches in sparse edge inference scenarios, where pipeline utilization is low.

Method: FlowSpec uses score-based step-wise verification, efficient draft management, and dynamic draft expansion strategies to enhance pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency.

Result: Achieves speedup ratios of 1.36×-1.77× compared to baselines in real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: FlowSpec significantly improves distributed LLM inference efficiency at the edge through innovative speculative decoding techniques.

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

*Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using textual entailment and in-context learning to automate legal text analysis for software compliance, reducing manual effort and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small organizations struggle with legal compliance due to resource constraints. Automated metadata extraction from legal texts is needed but current methods lack generalization and ignore metadata interrelationships.

Method: The approach uses textual entailment and in-context learning to generate a canonical representation of legal text as executable Python code, based on a domain-specific metamodel.

Result: The method achieved 89.4% test case success, with precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7, respectively, on 13 U.S. state laws.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates legal metadata extraction, reducing manual labeling needs and improving applicability to new documents.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like domain unfamiliarity and cognitive load in real-time interview question formulation, leveraging LLMs' NLP capabilities.

Method: Investigates GPT-4o for question generation, using a framework of common interviewer mistakes and interviewee speech. Tests via controlled experiments comparing LLM and human questions.

Result: LLM-generated questions are as good as or better than human-authored ones, especially when guided by mistake types.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance interview quality and ease in requirements elicitation, offering real-time support.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VeFIA is a framework for auditing inference software correctness in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) without compromising data privacy or adding latency. It uses TEE and a coordinator to detect anomalies with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFL lacks mechanisms to audit inference software correctness, risking unreliable results.

Method: VeFIA leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and a coordinator to validate computation results via random sampling.

Result: VeFIA detects anomalies exceeding 5.4% with 99.99% probability, achieving 100% accuracy in validation metrics.

Conclusion: VeFIA is the first solution to ensure inference software correctness in VFL, offering high accuracy and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

*Jiaxing Wang,Yifeng Yu,Jiahan Song,Bin Cao,Jing Fan,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RLHGNN is a novel framework for next activity prediction in business processes, using heterogeneous graphs and reinforcement learning to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequence-based and graph-based methods fail to capture non-sequential relationships and process complexities, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RLHGNN transforms event logs into heterogeneous graphs with distinct edge types, uses reinforcement learning to determine optimal structures, and applies relation-specific graph convolution for prediction.

Result: RLHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six datasets and achieves low inference latency (~1 ms per prediction).

Conclusion: RLHGNN provides an adaptive, efficient solution for real-time business process monitoring, addressing limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

TL;DR: DecoRTL, a novel decoding strategy for RTL code generation, improves syntactic validity, correctness, and diversity in LLM outputs by integrating self-consistency sampling and syntax-aware temperature adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LLM decoding strategies fail to meet RTL's structural and semantic demands, leading to poor code quality.

Method: DecoRTL combines self-consistency sampling (re-ranking candidates for correctness) and syntax-aware temperature adaptation (adjusting sampling temperature by token role).

Result: Evaluations show significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional correctness, and diversity with minimal performance overhead.

Conclusion: DecoRTL effectively addresses LLM decoding failures in RTL generation without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

*Marc-André Carbonneau,Benjamin van Niekerk,Hugo Seuté,Jean-Philippe Letendre,Herman Kamper,Julian Zaïdi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates ASV embeddings' limitations in capturing dynamic voice features like rhythm and proposes U3D, a new metric for dynamic rhythm patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASV embeddings focus on static voice features (e.g., timbre) but overlook dynamic aspects (e.g., rhythm), limiting speaker identity modeling.

Method: Analyzes ASV embeddings, identifies gaps, and introduces U3D to evaluate dynamic rhythm patterns.

Result: ASV embeddings neglect dynamic voice features; U3D addresses this gap and improves speaker similarity assessment.

Conclusion: U3D enhances speaker identity consistency evaluation, aiding voice cloning systems. Code is publicly released.

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASDA, a differential attention mechanism for audio self-supervised learning, improving performance by reducing ineffective attention allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers in audio self-supervised learning often allocate attention to irrelevant information, reducing discriminative ability.

Method: Proposes ASDA with dual-softmax operations and tuned differential coefficients to mitigate ineffective attention.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: 49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K, 98.3% accuracy on SPC-2, and 96.1% accuracy on ESC-50.

Conclusion: ASDA effectively enhances audio task performance, enabling broader applications.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A method for acoustic analysis of detection system performance in ecoacoustics, using signal-to-noise ratio and detection probability, optimizing training and modeling detection distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the evaluation of automatic signal detection methods in ecoacoustics, which are often assessed only by machine learning metrics, lacking acoustic performance analysis.

Method: Relates signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their detection probability, enabling system optimization and modeling of detection distance.

Result: Provides insights into system performance, optimizes training, and models detection distance, aiding in spatial density estimation of calls.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances acoustic monitoring by offering a practical tool for performance analysis and optimization in field conditions.

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates adversarial perturbations for disrupting voice cloning (VC) and proposes a two-stage purification method to counter these defenses, revealing limitations in current VC protection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and security concerns in voice cloning by evaluating and improving adversarial perturbation defenses.

Method: Proposes a two-stage purification method: (1) purify perturbed speech, (2) refine using phoneme guidance to align with clean speech distribution.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art purification techniques, degrading VC performance by distorting feature spaces.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust VC defenses due to the limitations of current adversarial perturbation methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

*Mostafa Sadeghi,Jean-Eudes Ayilo,Romain Serizel,Xavier Alameda-Pineda*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes two unsupervised speech enhancement algorithms using diffusion models, eliminating hyperparameter tuning and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on approximate noise-perturbed likelihood scores and hyperparameter tuning, which the authors aim to improve.

Method: Two algorithms are introduced: one integrates the diffusion prior with the observation model, and the other defines a diffusion process over noisy speech for exact likelihood scoring.

Result: Experiments show improved enhancement metrics and robustness to domain shifts on WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform supervised and unsupervised baselines, offering more principled and robust solutions.

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

*Lapo Santarlasci,Armando Rungi,Antonio Zinilli*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify 'true' green patents, finding they constitute 20% of previously classified green patents. It also links these patents to firm-level financial benefits in the EU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the classification of green patents and assess their economic impact on firms.

Method: Trains a neural network to expand a baseline dictionary for identifying green patents and analyzes their financial impact using firm-level data.

Result: True green patents make up 20% of prior classifications and are linked to higher sales, market shares, and productivity. High-novelty patents also increase profits.

Conclusion: Text analysis improves patent classification and highlights the economic value of green patents for policymaking.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for decoding behavior from brain-wide neural activity in zebrafish, showing improved performance with pre-trained weights and highlighting the potential of LLMs in neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how neural activity leads to behavior is challenging due to the complexity of large, densely wired mammalian brains. LLMs, with their sequence-to-sequence learning and generalization capabilities, offer a promising tool for neural decoding.

Method: The study introduces NLP4Neuro, a framework to systematically test LLMs on brain-wide calcium imaging and behavior data in zebrafish exposed to visual stimuli. It evaluates pre-trained LLMs and a mixture-of-experts model (DeepSeek Coder-7b).

Result: Pre-trained LLMs improved neural decoding accuracy. DeepSeek Coder-7b outperformed others, predicting tail movements over long timescales and providing interpretable neuron salience maps.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially pre-trained and advanced models like DeepSeek Coder-7b, are effective for brain-wide neural decoding, offering insights into neural circuit dissection.

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

*Zongpu Zhang,Pranab Dash,Y. Charlie Hu,Qiang Xu,Jian Li,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of deploying LLMs on mobile devices due to uncoordinated CPU, GPU, and memory governors, proposing FUSE, a unified governor that improves energy efficiency and reduces latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and energy demands of LLMs on mobile devices, exacerbated by independent and unoptimized DVFS governors for CPU, GPU, and memory, motivate the need for a coordinated solution.

Method: The study measures energy inefficiency in current LLM frameworks, analyzes the interplay of mobile governors, and designs FUSE, a unified energy-aware governor for optimized LLM inference.

Result: FUSE reduces time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% respectively, with the same energy-per-token.

Conclusion: FUSE demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency and latency for LLM inference on mobile devices, addressing the limitations of current uncoordinated governors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CineMyoPS is a deep neural network that segments myocardial pathologies (scars and edema) from cine CMR images, using motion and anatomy features with a consistency loss and time-series aggregation for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major global health concern, and while LGE and T2-weighted CMR imaging are effective, they are time-consuming and require contrast agents. Cine CMR offers a faster, contrast-free alternative.

Method: CineMyoPS extracts motion and anatomy features from cine CMR, uses a consistency loss for joint learning, and employs a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate features across the cardiac cycle.

Result: CineMyoPS shows promising performance in myocardial pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation on a multi-center dataset.

Conclusion: CineMyoPS provides an efficient, contrast-free solution for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment using cine CMR.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A non-invasive deep learning model (FC-DLIF) predicts arterial input functions from PET imaging, eliminating blood sampling in small-animal studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arterial blood sampling in small animals is invasive and terminal, hindering longitudinal studies. A non-invasive method is needed.

Method: FC-DLIF uses spatial and temporal feature extraction from PET imaging to predict input functions, trained and validated on [$^{18}$F]FDG data.

Result: FC-DLIF reliably predicts input functions, handles temporal shifts and truncated scans, but fails with untrained radiotracers.

Conclusion: FC-DLIF is a robust, non-invasive alternative to blood sampling, adaptable to varying scan conditions.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

*Zhurong Chen,Jinhua Chen,Wei Zhuo,Wufeng Xue,Dong Ni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework reconstructs personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices, improving LV and RV volume estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography's 2D limitations and 3D ultrasound's low resolution and manual demands necessitate a better method for 3D heart modeling.

Method: A 3D reconstruction pipeline alternates between optimizing 2D slice pose estimation and 3D integration using an implicit neural network.

Result: Significant improvement in LV volume estimation (1.98% error vs. 20.24%) and breakthrough RV volume estimation (5.75% error).

Conclusion: The framework enables personalized 3D heart analysis from 2D echo, offering high clinical potential.

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak and low-contrast boundaries in colorectal polyp images limit automated segmentation accuracy, and current methods either blur edges or rely on ineffective handcrafted filters.

Method: Proposes MEGANet-W with a two-level Haar wavelet head for edge extraction and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (WEGA) modules to fuse wavelet cues with semantic features.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on five datasets, improving mIoU by 2.3% and mDice by 1.2% without additional parameters.

Conclusion: MEGANet-W effectively addresses edge detail loss in polyp segmentation, offering a robust solution for variable imaging conditions.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

### [227] [Subtyping in DHOL -- Extended preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02855)
*Colin Rothgang,Florian Rabe*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: DHOL extends HOL with undecidable types but retains automation via translation. Refinement and quotient types are added elegantly as subtyping cases, avoiding costly representation changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners often request refinement and quotient types, but these are rare in automated theorem provers due to undecidable typing. DHOL's design makes adding them feasible.

Method: Refinement and quotient types are introduced as special cases of subtyping, treating inclusion/projection maps as identities. Syntax, semantics, and HOL translation are formalized.

Result: Soundness and completeness proofs are provided for the extended language, demonstrating practical viability.

Conclusion: DHOL's flexibility allows seamless integration of advanced types, enhancing expressiveness without sacrificing automation.

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

### [228] [Accelerated Portfolio Optimization and Option Pricing with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01972)
*Hadi Keramati,Samaneh Jazayeri*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: An RL framework optimizes block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers for portfolio optimization and option pricing, improving convergence and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional preconditioning techniques require manual tuning, which is inefficient for large-scale problems like portfolio optimization and option pricing.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers.

Result: Demonstrates accelerated convergence and reduced computational costs on real-world portfolio optimization matrices.

Conclusion: The RL-driven solver enables faster decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

### [229] [Discovery of Fatigue Strength Models via Feature Engineering and automated eXplainable Machine Learning applied to the welded Transverse Stiffener](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02005)
*Michael A. Kraus,Helen Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A unified AutoML and XAI approach predicts fatigue strength in welded structures, balancing accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance fatigue strength prediction in welded transverse stiffener details by combining expert-driven and algorithmic feature engineering for better accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Used AutoML to train regression models (gradient boosting, random forests, neural networks) under three feature schemes (domain-informed, algorithmic, combined) and compared their performance.

Result: Domain-informed model achieved the best balance (RMSE ≈ 30.6 MPa, R² ≈ 0.780%). XAI identified key predictors like stress ratio and post-weld treatment.

Conclusion: Integrating AutoML with XAI produces accurate, interpretable models for fatigue strength, bridging data-driven modeling with engineering validation.

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

### [230] [AC-Refiner: Efficient Arithmetic Circuit Optimization Using Conditional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02598)
*Chenhao Xue,Kezhi Li,Jiaxing Zhang,Yi Ren,Zhengyuan Shi,Chen Zhang,Yibo Lin,Lining Zhang,Qiang Xu,Guangyu Sun*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: AC-Refiner is a framework using conditional diffusion models to optimize arithmetic circuits, outperforming existing methods by generating high-quality designs near the Pareto frontier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing arithmetic circuits is challenging due to vast design spaces and physical constraints, with current deep learning methods struggling to explore high-potential variants efficiently.

Method: AC-Refiner reframes circuit synthesis as a conditional image generation task, using diffusion models conditioned on quality-of-results (QoRs) to produce high-quality designs.

Result: AC-Refiner generates superior Pareto-optimal designs, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and validates gains in practical applications.

Conclusion: AC-Refiner effectively addresses optimization challenges in arithmetic circuits, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

*Yongsen Zheng,Zongxuan Xie,Guohua Wang,Ziyao Liu,Liang Lin,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyFairCRS, a framework to address unfairness in dynamic Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) by promoting multi-interest diversity fairness through hypergraph contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfairness in RSs leads to biased outcomes (e.g., gender, race, popularity). Existing solutions focus on static contexts, but unfairness worsens over time, causing issues like the Matthew effect.

Method: HyFairCRS uses hypergraph contrastive learning to capture diverse user interests, then applies these in conversations for fair item predictions in dynamic CRSs.

Result: Experiments on two CRS datasets show HyFairCRS achieves state-of-the-art performance and effectively reduces unfairness.

Conclusion: HyFairCRS successfully addresses fairness in dynamic CRSs, offering a novel solution for multi-interest diversity fairness.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ManifoldMind is a hyperbolic-space recommender system using adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres for personalized uncertainty modeling and semantic exploration, outperforming baselines in NDCG, calibration, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies by enabling personalized uncertainty modeling and flexible geometry-aware exploration.

Method: Represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres in hyperbolic space, using a curvature-aware semantic kernel for multi-hop inference.

Result: Outperforms baselines on four benchmarks in NDCG, calibration, and diversity, with transparent reasoning traces.

Conclusion: ManifoldMind offers trustworthy, exploration-driven recommendations, especially in sparse or abstract domains.

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

### [233] [When LLMs Disagree: Diagnosing Relevance Filtering Bias and Retrieval Divergence in SDG Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02139)
*William A. Ingram,Bipasha Banerjee,Edward A. Fox*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study investigates labeling disagreements between LLaMA and Qwen LLMs on scholarly abstracts related to SDGs, revealing systematic patterns and proposing disagreement analysis for retrieval evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how labeling disagreements between LLMs affect downstream retrieval, especially in domains like policy-relevant search tasks.

Method: Analyzed disagreement subsets between LLaMA and Qwen on SDG-related abstracts, examining lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and classification predictability.

Result: Disagreement is systematic, showing consistent lexical patterns, divergent top-ranked outputs, and predictability (AUCs > 0.74).

Conclusion: LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability; disagreement analysis should be part of retrieval evaluation, especially for thematic tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper reviews challenges in music recommendation systems due to sparse user interactions, focusing on content filtering to address biases in collaborative filtering. It explores song classification methods like LLMs and audio processing, and discusses resolving conflicts between these methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative filtering is less effective for music recommendation due to sparse interactions. The paper aims to address these challenges by examining content filtering methods.

Method: The review explores song classification techniques, including lyrical analysis with LLMs and audio signal processing, and discusses resolving conflicts between these methods.

Result: Content filtering, particularly using LLMs and audio processing, can mitigate biases in collaborative filtering for music recommendations.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of content filtering to improve music recommendation systems and suggests resolving conflicts between different analysis methods.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

### [235] [Listwise Preference Alignment Optimization for Tail Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02255)
*Zihao Li,Chao Yang,Tong Zhang,Yakun Chen,Xianzhi Wang,Guandong Xu,Daoyi Dong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LPO4Rec introduces a listwise comparison method for preference alignment in recommendation systems, improving training efficiency and tail-item recommendation performance without explicit reward modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for preference alignment in recommendation systems are either computationally expensive (explicit reward modeling) or inefficient (pairwise comparison), and none address tail-item recommendation.

Method: LPO4Rec extends the Bradley-Terry model to listwise comparison, derives a closed-form optimal policy, and uses adaptive negative sampling and reweighting for tail-item prioritization.

Result: LPO4Rec outperforms 10 baselines, achieving up to 50% performance improvement in tail-item recommendation and reducing GPU memory usage by 17.9% compared to DPO.

Conclusion: LPO4Rec provides an efficient and effective solution for preference alignment in recommendation systems, particularly for tail-item recommendations.

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Yuhanleeee/LPO4Rec.

*Artur Zolkowski,Kei Nishimura-Gasparian,Robert McCarthy,Roland S. Zimmermann,David Lindner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs, finding nascent abilities to encode messages and reasoning, but insufficient to bypass well-designed monitors currently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the risks posed by LLMs evading monitoring through steganography, encoding hidden information in seemingly benign outputs.

Method: Evaluated two types of steganography: encoded messages and encoded reasoning, testing models under standard and additional affordances.

Result: Current LLMs struggle to encode short messages unnoticed but succeed with extra affordances. Early signs of encoded reasoning exist, but subtle evasion remains rare.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show nascent steganographic capabilities, insufficient to bypass monitors now, but future improvements could change this.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

*Lu Yan,Zhuo Zhang,Xiangzhe Xu,Shengwei An,Guangyu Shen,Zhou Xuan,Xuan Chen,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a framework that bypasses LLM safeguards by decomposing malicious tasks into benign sub-tasks, enabling reliable malware generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in LLM alignment mechanisms, which fail to detect malicious intent when tasks are decomposed into benign sub-tasks.

Method: MGC uses a Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to translate high-level malicious intents into seemingly harmless code snippets.

Result: MGC outperforms jailbreaking (+365.79%) and underground services (+78.07%) in correctness, and can reproduce/enhance 16 real-world malware samples.

Conclusion: The work highlights risks of compositional attacks on aligned AI systems, urging improved safeguards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI can address the blockchain oracle problem, enhancing data reliability but not eliminating trust assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The blockchain oracle problem limits trustless applications by hindering reliable external data integration. The paper aims to assess AI's role in mitigating this issue.

Method: The study reviews AI techniques like anomaly detection, fact extraction, reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance to improve oracle systems.

Result: AI enhances data quality and system resilience but cannot remove reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs.

Conclusion: AI should complement oracle designs as an inference and filtering layer, not replace trust assumptions.

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance security in AI systems by addressing the unpredictability and resilience gaps of software-based pseudo-random number generators, focusing on protecting DNN model parameters.

Method: Proposes EIM-TRNG, leveraging DRAM cell randomness under RowHammer for entropy, and applies it to encode DNN weights using fixed and unpredictable bit-flips, with decryption via derived keys.

Result: Validates DRAM-based entropy extraction as effective for low-cost hardware security, ensuring data confidentiality and model authenticity.

Conclusion: EIM-TRNG offers a robust, hardware-level solution for securing machine learning models, demonstrating promise for future applications in AI security.

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline using fine-tuned LLMs for anomaly detection and mitigation in IoT security logs, outperforming classical ML classifiers in multi-class attack classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Log analysis is crucial for cybersecurity, and LLMs offer potential for improved threat detection and mitigation in IoT systems.

Method: Three open-source LLMs are compared using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning strategies on an IoT dataset, with MITRE CAPEC mapping for mitigation recommendations.

Result: LLMs outperform baseline models in multi-class anomaly detection and provide combined detection and mitigation guidance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs enhance IoT security log analysis by improving detection accuracy and offering actionable mitigation recommendations.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

*Francesco Blefari,Cristian Cosentino,Francesco Aurelio Pironti,Angelo Furfaro,Fabrizio Marozzo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberRAG is an agent-based RAG framework for real-time cyber-attack classification, explanation, and reporting, reducing false positives and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming high false-positive rates and irrelevant context retrieval in conventional IDS/IPS and RAG systems.

Method: Modular framework with a central LLM agent orchestrating specialized classifiers, tool adapters, and iterative retrieval-reason loops.

Result: Achieves 94.92% classification accuracy, 0.94 BERTScore, and 4.9/5 expert evaluation for explanations.

Conclusion: Agentic, specialist-oriented RAG enhances detection accuracy and interpretability, enabling scalable semi-autonomous cyber-defence.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based

*Sizhe Chen,Arman Zharmagambetov,David Wagner,Chuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Meta SecAlign is the first open-source LLM with built-in defense against prompt injection attacks, achieving commercial-grade performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source models are needed for collaborative AI security research to mitigate prompt injection threats.

Method: Developed Meta SecAlign using an improved SOTA SecAlign defense, trained on a generic instruction-tuning dataset.

Result: Achieves SOTA robustness against prompt injection and comparable utility to closed-source commercial LLMs.

Conclusion: Meta SecAlign enables open research and co-development of attacks and defenses, advancing AI security.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

### [243] [Alleviating Attack Data Scarcity: SCANIA's Experience Towards Enhancing In-Vehicle Cyber Security Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02607)
*Frida Sundfeldt,Bianca Widstam,Mahshid Helali Moghadam,Kuo-Yun Liang,Anders Vesterberg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a context-aware attack data generator for in-vehicle networks to address data scarcity for ML-driven intrusion detection systems, validated through an IDS case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for adaptive intrusion detection in connected vehicles due to evolving cyber threats, coupled with limited real-world attack data, drives the development of synthetic attack data.

Method: A parameterized attack data generator creates CAN logs for various attack types (DoS, fuzzy, spoofing, etc.), enhanced with CAN message decoding and intensity adjustments.

Result: The generated data proves effective in training deep neural network IDS models, demonstrating high detection and classification performance.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently produces high-quality attack-representing data, validated by IDS performance, and offers insights for real-world applicability.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for granular and interpretable tools to detect AI-related disclosures in financial filings, where prior methods lacked precision.

Method: Developed FinAI-BERT, a domain-adapted transformer model, fine-tuned on 1,586 manually curated sentences from U.S. bank reports (2015-2023).

Result: Near-perfect performance (99.37% accuracy, F1 0.993), surpassing Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability and robustness confirmed via SHAP, bias analysis, and adversarial checks.

Conclusion: Advances financial NLP with fine-grained AI classification, providing a scalable, transparent tool for analysts, regulators, and researchers.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why different configurations of the same algorithm perform variably and identify problem features affecting outcomes.

Method: Performance footprints of six modCMA variants on 24 BBOB problems in 5D and 30D settings.

Result: Shared and distinct behavioral patterns due to problem interactions, showing footprints' effectiveness in interpretability.

Conclusion: Algorithm footprints enhance interpretability and aid in configuration decisions.

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in

TL;DR: A novel visualization method clusters solution candidates and tracks their evolution to better understand metaheuristic algorithms, introducing stability and similarity metrics for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visualization techniques fail to capture structural dynamics in complex solution spaces, necessitating a better method.

Method: Proposes clustering solution candidates and tracking cluster evolution, with new metrics for stability and similarity.

Result: Applied to ten algorithms, revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors.

Conclusion: Provides a deeper, interpretable understanding of metaheuristic search dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional stress testing by capturing complex dependencies and enabling nuanced scenario generation.

Method: Uses dimensionality reduction (PCA, Autoencoders), extends to Variational Autoencoders for probabilistic latent space, and employs Monte Carlo simulations for scenario generation. Risk estimation via Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall.

Result: Demonstrates improved flexibility, robustness, and realism in financial stress testing.

Conclusion: Machine learning enhances stress testing by better modeling non-linear dependencies and supporting distribution-aware simulations.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results, identified long-range correlations, and confirmed the half-filled stripe ground state, aligning with cuprate experiments.

Conclusion: NQS is a powerful tool for solving complex many-fermion systems, validated by its success with the 2D Hubbard model.

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a
promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper explores precoding design for mmWave MIMO systems with obstructed paths, using RIS to enhance transmission. It replaces exhaustive search with DNN for faster codeword selection, achieving sub-optimal spectral efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve throughput in mmWave MIMO systems with blocked paths by leveraging RIS, while reducing the computational burden of traditional methods.

Method: Uses permuted DFT vectors for codebook design and trains a DNN to replace exhaustive search for codeword selection.

Result: DNN achieves sub-optimal spectral efficiency efficiently, even with varying distances between users and RIS.

Conclusion: DNNs offer a promising solution for advancing RIS-aided systems by balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: tubuleTracker is a fast, objective software tool for analyzing endothelial network architecture and maturity, outperforming manual and ImageJ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-consuming, subjective nature of manual analysis and the limitations of existing automated tools like ImageJ in studying angiogenesis.

Method: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured, and images were analyzed manually, with ImageJ, and using tubuleTracker. Key metrics included tubule count, length, node count, area, and circularity.

Result: tubuleTracker was significantly faster and more consistent than manual and ImageJ analysis. Its metrics, especially vessel circularity, effectively captured angiogenesis maturity.

Conclusion: tubuleTracker is a superior tool for rapid, objective analysis of endothelial networks and is available as free shareware.

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

TL;DR: An efficient real-time approximation for image-based lighting of glints, enabling dynamic material properties and environment maps with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of rendering materials with sparkling or glittering appearances under dynamic lighting conditions in real-time applications.

Method: Uses environment map filtering and a novel dual-gated Gaussian approximation for hierarchical sampling of multinomial distributions.

Result: Close to ground-truth renderings with robust performance and twice the memory requirement for prefiltered environment maps.

Conclusion: The method effectively approximates glint rendering in real-time with acceptable trade-offs in memory usage.

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

TL;DR: LGSG is a novel graph generation framework using diffusion models and node embeddings, enabling scalable and flexible generation without node ID dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph generation models rely on node IDs, limiting scalability and ignoring node attributes.

Method: LGSG leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate graphs of varying sizes without retraining.

Result: LGSG matches baseline models in standard metrics and excels in overlooked ones like clustering tendency, while maintaining structural consistency across sizes.

Conclusion: LGSG offers a robust, scalable solution for graph generation, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open Banking's rise creates competition, requiring financial institutions to manage data inflow and outflow strategically to improve services and competitiveness.

Method: A hybrid data balancing strategy (ADASYN and NEARMISS) was used to train XGBoost models on data from 3.2 million customers. EMA combined SHAP and CART to interpret influential features.

Result: Models achieved 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow predictions. Key features included mobile transactions, interactions, and credit card usage.

Conclusion: Mobile engagement and credit features significantly influence data-sharing behavior, offering strategic insights for financial institutions in Open Banking.

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness with a quadrotor example, showing improvements via robust predictions and online learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control

disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to
learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust
predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in
the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online

TL;DR: The paper studies learning Bayes correlated equilibria (BCE) in non-truthful auctions, proving polynomial sample complexity for a class of auctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent strategic behaviors in auctions lead to undesirable outcomes; BCE offers a coordinated alternative but requires valuation distribution knowledge, which is often unavailable.

Method: Reduction to estimating bidders' expected utility from samples and analyzing pseudo-dimension of monotone bidding strategies.

Result: BCEs in first-price and all-pay auctions can be learned with polynomial sample complexity.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical approach to learning BCEs in auctions with limited distribution knowledge.

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

Motivation: Lack of theoretical results for the adaptive ISTA, despite its practical success.

Method: Theoretical analysis of adaptive ISTA with median absolute deviation for noise estimation.

Result: Proves fixed-point properties (scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, local stability), local linear convergence, and global convergence.

Conclusion: The adaptive ISTA is theoretically validated, showing robust convergence and stability properties.

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the

deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

*Ben Adcock,Bernhard Hientzsch,Akil Narayan,Yiming Xu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining Christoffel sampling and optimal experimental design is proposed for efficient conditional expectation estimation with noisy data, outperforming existing methods in high-noise scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations with heavily polluted data, where existing methods underperform in high-noise regimes.

Method: A hybrid algorithm integrating Christoffel sampling and optimal experimental design, extended to convex-constrained settings and adaptive random subspaces for random fields.

Result: Improved computational efficiency, sample complexity, and theoretical guarantees, validated by numerical studies on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses high-noise challenges, offering superior performance and adaptability in various settings.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive
random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the
adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies
on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem
in computational finance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transfer learning method for matrix completion, leveraging auxiliary data to improve low-rank target matrix estimation. It proves minimax optimality and introduces a detection procedure for unknown source relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing low-rank matrix estimation by utilizing auxiliary data, addressing limitations of traditional single-target methods.

Method: A transfer learning procedure with prior knowledge of favorable source datasets, using sharp concentration inequalities for optimal convergence rates.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods when source matrices are close to the target, with minimax optimality and efficient source detection.

Conclusion: The method is validated through simulations and real data, proving effective for matrix completion with auxiliary data.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the
relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection
procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection
consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the
validity of our methodology.

### [260] [It's Hard to Be Normal: The Impact of Noise on Structure-agnostic Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02275)
*Jikai Jin,Lester Mackey,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores how treatment noise distribution affects causal inference in structure-agnostic settings, showing DML is optimal for Gaussian noise but suboptimal otherwise. It introduces ACE procedures for higher-order robustness and validates them experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of double machine learning (DML) in causal inference under non-Gaussian treatment noise and develop more robust estimators.

Method: The study analyzes DML in the partially linear model, introduces ACE procedures for higher-order robustness, and provides minimax guarantees for binary treatments.

Result: DML is minimax optimal for Gaussian noise but suboptimal for non-Gaussian noise. ACE procedures outperform DML by leveraging higher-order cumulants.

Conclusion: The distribution of treatment noise significantly impacts causal inference accuracy, and ACE procedures offer practical improvements over DML in non-Gaussian settings.

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper improves sparse variational Gaussian processes by introducing a block-diagonal scaling matrix, tightening the variational bound, and integrates it with Power Expectation Propagation (PEP) for competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the scalability and performance of sparse Gaussian process models by refining the variational approximation with structured scaling matrices.

Method: Extends sparse variational GPs with a block-diagonal scaling matrix and integrates it into the PEP framework for flexible and improved approximations.

Result: The block-diagonal approximation performs similarly or better than diagonal ones at comparable computational costs, and PEP with structured posteriors offers competitive performance.

Conclusion: The proposed structured approximations and PEP framework provide effective, flexible alternatives to standard variational methods for sparse GPs.

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

*Semih Kacmaz,E. A. Huerta,Roland Haas*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) and diffusion models accurately simulates 2D MHD turbulence across Reynolds numbers, outperforming deterministic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simulating fully developed turbulence across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which deterministic surrogates struggle with.

Method: Uses PINOs for low-frequency dynamics and a diffusion model for high-frequency residuals, trained on high-fidelity simulations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, capturing spectral energy distributions, non-Gaussian statistics, and cross-field correlations, even at extreme turbulence levels.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework enables accurate modeling of MHD turbulence, surpassing deterministic surrogates and handling extreme conditions effectively.

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed
Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a selective feature re-encoding strategy and a parallel-mode QCNN architecture to enhance quantum machine learning for image classification, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in NISQ devices and quantum principles like entanglement and superposition have driven interest in QML, particularly QCNNs for classifying quantum and classical data. This study aims to improve QCNN performance in image classification.

Method: The study introduces a selective feature re-encoding strategy to prioritize informative features and a parallel-mode QCNN architecture combining PCA and Autoencoder features in a unified training scheme.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST show the selective re-encoding improves feature processing, and the parallel QCNN outperforms individual models and traditional ensemble methods in accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance QCNN performance, offering superior accuracy and generalization for image classification tasks, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Usability evaluation is costly and requires expert time; synthetic evaluation using LLMs offers a scalable alternative.

Method: Developed a method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs to analyze images and provide design feedback, compared to human evaluators.

Result: Synthetic evaluation identified 73% and 77% of issues, outperforming humans (57% and 63%), with strengths in layout issues but weaknesses in UI components and cross-screen violations.

Conclusion: Synthetic heuristic evaluation shows promise but has limitations; performance differences inform future design of such evaluations.

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study examines how LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini generate emotionally rich interactions, finding that while they align structurally with empathy, human evaluation reveals gaps in perceived empathy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance conversational agents' emotional intelligence, particularly empathetic listening, as they integrate into daily human interactions.

Method: Used a small expert-crafted dataset to generate extended conversations with ChatGPT and Gemini, analyzing emotional progression via sentiment analysis (VADER) and expert assessments.

Result: Generated conversations mirrored emotional structure but lacked qualitative depth in empathy and coherence according to human evaluators.

Conclusion: Emotion modeling in dialogues needs structural alignment and qualitative depth, emphasizing combined automated and human-centered methods for emotionally competent agents.

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Data scientists use a bricolage process to translate fuzzy concepts into target variables, balancing validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how data scientists construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks involving vague concepts.

Method: Interviews with 15 data scientists in education and healthcare.

Result: Target variables are created through iterative negotiation, adapting strategies like swapping or composing outcomes to meet criteria.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for future research to better support target variable construction in HCI, CSCW, and ML.

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven design strategies for metamaterials face issues like task-specific retraining, poor OOD generalization, and the need for separate models for forward and inverse design.

Method: MetaFO uses a Bayesian transformer-based approach to learn metamaterial mechanics, allowing probabilistic predictions and nonlinear inverse design without retraining.

Result: MetaFO achieves zero-shot predictions across unseen material combinations and excels in OOD inverse design, uncovering complex structure-property relationships.

Conclusion: MetaFO represents a scalable, generalizable paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, enabling next-generation innovations.

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

TL;DR: LiTEN introduces a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA) to balance accuracy and efficiency in biomolecular simulations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation methods (classical force fields, QM, and AIFFs) have limitations in accuracy, efficiency, or generalizability for biomolecular modeling.

Method: LiTEN uses TQA to model three- and four-body interactions with linear complexity, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. LiTEN-FF is pre-trained on nablaDFT and fine-tuned on SPICE for broad generalization.

Result: LiTEN achieves SOTA performance on rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, with 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for large biomolecules.

Conclusion: LiTEN provides a versatile, efficient framework for biomolecular modeling, advancing drug discovery and related applications.

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between AI-generated molecules and their synthetic feasibility hinders drug and material discovery. SynTwins aims to bridge this gap.

Result: SynTwins outperforms state-of-the-art models in generating accessible analogs and integrates well with optimization frameworks, ensuring synthesizability.

Conclusion: SynTwins effectively bridges computational design and experimental synthesis, accelerating the discovery of feasible molecules with desired properties.

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

TL;DR: DeSTA2.5-Audio is a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) that avoids task-specific tuning by using a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy, preserving language abilities while achieving strong audio-text alignment. It outperforms benchmarks with a large, diverse dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing catastrophic forgetting in LALMs when augmenting LLMs with auditory capabilities, and enabling zero-shot generalization without task-specific tuning.

Method: Proposes DeSTA, a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy where the LLM generates its own training targets, using a dataset (DeSTA-AQA5M) with 5M samples from 7K hours of diverse audio.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Dynamic-SUPERB and MMAU, demonstrating superior auditory perception and instruction-following.

Conclusion: Careful data construction is crucial for robust LALMs, and DeSTA's self-generated strategy offers a practical approach for general-purpose models.

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A multi-agent approach for auditory scene analysis (MASA) is proposed to run tasks in parallel with feedback loops, reducing errors and response time compared to traditional linear methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear ASA systems are error-prone and slow, making them unsuitable for applications requiring low computational footprint and fast response.

Method: A multi-agent system is introduced where tasks (location, separation, classification) run in parallel with feedback loops to correct errors.

Result: The MASA system is robust against errors, maintains low complexity, and achieves faster response times.

Conclusion: The proposed MASA framework, using open-source tools, offers a viable solution for real-time ASA applications.

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

*Boris Kriuk,Logic Ng,Zarif Al Hossain*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: DeepSupp is a deep learning method using multi-head attention to detect financial support levels, outperforming traditional and baseline methods in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional support and resistance (SR) level identification methods struggle with modern market volatility, and existing machine learning approaches often focus on price prediction rather than structural level detection.

Method: DeepSupp employs multi-head attention mechanisms, dynamic correlation matrices, and an attention-based autoencoder for representation learning, followed by DBSCAN clustering to extract support levels.

Result: DeepSupp achieves state-of-the-art performance on S&P 500 tickers, excelling in support accuracy and market regime sensitivity across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: DeepSupp addresses gaps in SR detection, showcasing the potential of attention-based architectures for improving technical trading strategies.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

TL;DR: A deep learning model (LSTNet) forecasts short-term employment changes and assesses long-term industry health using labor market data, outperforming baselines and providing interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve employment forecasting and industry health assessment using advanced time-series analysis of labor market data.

Method: Uses LSTNet to process multivariate time series (employment, wages, turnover, job openings) for 7-day forecasts and an Industry Employment Health Index (IEHI).

Result: Outperforms baseline models, especially in stable industries, with IEHI rankings aligning well with actual employment volatility.

Conclusion: The approach is effective but could benefit from further improvements in interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach for forecasting short-term employment
changes and assessing long-term industry health using labor market data from
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our system leverages a Long- and
Short-Term Time-series Network (LSTNet) to process multivariate time series
data, including employment levels, wages, turnover rates, and job openings. The
model outputs both 7-day employment forecasts and an interpretable Industry
Employment Health Index (IEHI). Our approach outperforms baseline models across
most sectors, particularly in stable industries, and demonstrates strong
alignment between IEHI rankings and actual employment volatility. We discuss
error patterns, sector-specific performance, and future directions for
improving interpretability and generalization.

### [275] [NGAT: A Node-level Graph Attention Network for Long-term Stock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02018)
*Yingjie Niu,Mingchuan Zhao,Valerio Poti,Ruihai Dong*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) for stock prediction, addressing challenges in current graph representation learning methods for financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representation learning methods in finance face challenges like obscured relational advantages, excessive complexity, and lack of effective graph structure comparison.

Method: The authors introduce a long-term stock prediction task and develop NGAT for corporate relationship graphs, comparing it with existing methods.

Result: Experiments on two datasets show NGAT's effectiveness, highlighting limitations of existing graph comparison methods.

Conclusion: The proposed NGAT and task design improve stock prediction, with the project made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The study uses an LSTM model to predict stock returns with over 90% accuracy, outperforming other deep learning models like CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting stock returns is challenging but crucial for investors. The study aims to improve predictability using LSTM models.

Method: The LSTM model was trained on cleaned and normalized historical data from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and compared with CNN and other models.

Result: The LSTM model achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting stock prices and returns.

Conclusion: LSTM models are effective for financial time-series prediction, and future research should explore hybrid models with CNN.

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

### [277] [News Sentiment Embeddings for Stock Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01970)
*Ayaan Qayyum*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores using WSJ headlines and OpenAI-based embeddings to predict SPY stock prices, showing a 40% improvement over models without headline data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage news headlines for stock price prediction, addressing time-dependent and independent impacts of news while handling market noise.

Method: Uses OpenAI-based text embeddings and PCA for feature extraction, combined with financial data (DXY, Treasury Yields). Trains 390+ ML models.

Result: Headline embeddings improve stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to models without them.

Conclusion: Incorporating headline data embeddings significantly enhances stock price prediction accuracy.

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

### [278] [Detecting Fraud in Financial Networks: A Semi-Supervised GNN Approach with Granger-Causal Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01980)
*Linh Nguyen,Marcel Boersma,Erman Acar*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: SAGE-FIN is a semi-supervised GNN approach for fraud detection in financial networks, addressing sparse labels and explainability using Granger causality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fraud detection is costly and challenging due to sparse labels and regulatory demands for explainability.

Method: Proposes SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised GNN with Granger causal explanations for financial networks.

Result: Validated on Elliptic++ dataset, showing effective fraud detection and explainability without network structure assumptions.

Conclusion: SAGE-FIN offers a viable solution for fraud detection with regulatory-compliant explanations.

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

*Cong Wang,Roberto Calandra,Verena Klös*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores user preferences for robot explanations in surprising situations during cleaning tasks, proposing algorithms for BDI robots to generate concise, context-aware explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot interaction by addressing user confusion and annoyance through timely and relevant explanations of robot actions.

Method: Investigated user preferences for explanation demand and content in a kitchen cleaning scenario, then developed algorithms for identifying surprising actions and constructing explanations for BDI robots.

Result: Users prefer explanations in surprising situations, favoring concise content that clarifies intentions and contextual factors.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms enhance BDI robots' ability to provide effective, context-specific explanations, improving human-robot interaction.

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

### [280] [Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171)
*Miroslav Cibula,Kristína Malinovská,Matthias Kerzel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method for robotic trajectory planning, using a recurrent architecture to generate trajectories without imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling-based planners are computationally intensive, and supervised learning methods imitate observed trajectories without considering goal success. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: A cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme using a recurrent architecture, leveraging paired forward and inverse kinematics models.

Result: The model successfully learns to generate trajectories without imitation, showing potential for adaptive solutions in complex tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a feasible alternative to traditional and supervised approaches, enabling adaptive planning for complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

TL;DR: A novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model predicts trajectory waypoints using Vision Language Models (VLMs) for efficient, robot-agnostic training and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models are expensive to train and output low-level controls, limiting efficiency and adaptability.

Method: The proposed model uses VLMs to infer end-effector poses in image coordinates, predicts trajectory waypoints, and incorporates depth images and inference-time techniques.

Result: The model shows strong sim-to-real transfer and performs effectively on real robotic systems.

Conclusion: The lightweight, efficient VLA model successfully learns executable trajectories and demonstrates versatility in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

TL;DR: MISCGrasp is a volumetric grasping method using multi-scale feature extraction and contrastive learning for adaptive robotic grasping, outperforming baselines in tabletop decluttering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in robotic grasping for objects with varying shapes and sizes.

Method: Integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive learning, using Insight and Empower Transformers for feature interaction and enhancement.

Result: Outperforms baseline and variant methods in simulated and real-world tabletop decluttering tasks.

Conclusion: MISCGrasp effectively balances fine geometric details and overall structures, improving robotic grasping adaptability.

Abstract: Robotic grasping faces challenges in adapting to objects with varying shapes
and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method
that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level
features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine
geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp
utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among
positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate
that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop
decluttering tasks. More details are available at https://miscgrasp.github.io/.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MultiGen integrates generative models into physics simulators for multisensory simulation, enabling zero-shot transfer to real-world tasks like robot pouring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning multimodal policies at scale is challenging due to difficulties in simulating non-visual modalities like sound.

Method: MultiGen combines large-scale generative models with physics simulators to synthesize realistic audio from simulation video.

Result: The framework enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories without real robot data and achieves zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring tasks.

Conclusion: Generative modeling can simulate hard-to-model modalities and bridge the multimodal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

*Gabriel O. Flores-Aquino,Octavio Gutierrez-Frias,Juan Irving Vasquez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes SkelUnet, a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder based on U-Net, for efficient skeletonization of navigation maps, enabling faster and safer path planning for UAVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional skeletonization algorithms are resource-intensive and not optimized for path planning. The goal is to balance response time, safety, and path length for applications like UAV navigation.

Method: Uses SkelUnet (DDAE based on U-Net) to compute skeletonized maps, enabling one-shot sampling (OSS) for exploration. Trained on 12,500 dungeon maps and tested on 250 unseen maps in a UAV simulation.

Result: SkelUnet connects all free workspace regions, provides safer paths, and reduces processing times compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: SkelUnet is efficient and suitable for mobile service robots in structured environments, offering significant advantages in path planning.

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

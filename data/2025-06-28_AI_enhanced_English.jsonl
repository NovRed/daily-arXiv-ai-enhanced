Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,\nnarratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for\npersonalized and engaging story animation.

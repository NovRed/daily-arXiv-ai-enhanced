### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel General Feature Prediction framework (GFP) replaces low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction for efficient masked skeleton modeling in action recognition, achieving 6.2x faster training and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked autoencoder approaches for skeleton-based action recognition limit reconstruction to raw joint coordinates or simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited semantic representation.

Method: Proposes GFP framework with collaborative learning where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, incorporating constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity and prevent model collapse.

Result: Achieves 6.2x faster training than standard masked skeleton modeling methods and superior representation quality, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: The GFP framework effectively addresses computational redundancy and limited semantics in existing approaches by shifting from low-level reconstruction to high-level feature prediction, achieving both efficiency and superior performance in skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

### [2] [Teacher-Student Model for Detecting and Classifying Mitosis in the MIDOG 2025 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03614)
*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Dimitri Androutsos,Susan Done,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based mitosis detection using teacher-student UNet with domain generalization for robust segmentation and classification across different domains and imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual mitosis counting is time-consuming and inconsistent between pathologists. AI solutions face domain shift issues and severe class imbalance between mitotic figures and normal nuclei.

Method: Teacher-student UNet segmentation with contrastive learning and domain-adversarial training. Multi-scale CNN classifier with multi-task learning for mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification on preliminary test set.

Conclusion: Integration of segmentation-based detection and classification in a unified framework effectively addresses domain shift and data imbalance for robust mitosis analysis.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM is a two-stage framework that addresses multiple overlapping biases in vision models by first learning to recognize biases through adaptive encoders, then pruning bias directions from gradients, resulting in improved worst-group accuracy and reduced bias amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images contain multiple overlapping biases that collectively impair vision model performance and fairness. Addressing biases individually is inadequate as mitigating one bias often intensifies others.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) trains encoders for each attribute and integrates them with main backbone to explicitly recognize biases; 2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning prunes bias directions from backbone's gradients. Also introduces Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA) metric to handle subgroup imbalance and distribution shifts.

Result: Validated on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO datasets - boosted worst group accuracy, halved multi-attribute bias amplification, and achieved new low in SBA even with increasing bias complexity and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: GMBM provides the first practical, end-to-end multi-bias solution for visual recognition that works effectively under complex bias scenarios and distribution shifts.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight U-Net achieves equivalent cardiac segmentation performance to nnU-Net with 16x smaller size and 4x faster speed through optimized components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time clinical measurements from echocardiography by reducing the large size and slow speed of nnU-Net models while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Method: Conducted ablation study to identify most effective nnU-Net components, then developed lightweight U-Net with optimized data augmentation, architecture, loss functions, and post-processing.

Result: Achieved statistically equivalent Dice scores (0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89 for LV/MYO/LA) with 2M vs 33M parameters, 16x smaller model, and 4x faster processing (1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame).

Conclusion: Simple affine augmentations and deep supervision are key drivers of performance, enabling development of efficient models for real-time cardiac segmentation without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Revised treeX algorithm for unsupervised tree instance segmentation from laser scanning data, offering resource-efficient alternative to deep learning with improved runtime and accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D forest data but existing deep learning methods require large annotated datasets and substantial computational resources, creating need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: Revised version of treeX algorithm combining clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation, with parameter presets for ground-based (TLS/PLS) and UAV-borne (ULS) laser scanning data.

Result: Reduces runtime and improves accuracy compared to original treeX, with F1-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data. Achieves F1-score of 0.58 for ULS data (where original algorithm failed) and accuracy similar to recent open-source deep learning methods for TLS/PLS data.

Conclusion: Method serves as resource-efficient alternative to deep learning when data characteristics align, and for semi-automatic label generation for deep learning models. Open-source Python implementation provided for broader adoption.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D introduces a reconstructive geometry instruction tuning framework that uses dual-supervision with 3D geometric information as both input and learning targets, significantly improving 3D scene understanding in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Multimodal Models excel at 2D visual understanding but struggle with 3D scene understanding due to reliance on text-only supervision, which lacks geometric constraints needed for robust spatial representations.

Method: Proposes a dual-supervision paradigm with complementary object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to develop spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models by incorporating geometry-aware supervision directly into the training process.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

*Seth Z. Zhao,Huizhi Zhang,Zhaowei Li,Juntong Peng,Anthony Chui,Zewei Zhou,Zonglin Meng,Hao Xiang,Zhiyu Huang,Fujia Wang,Ran Tian,Chenfeng Xu,Bolei Zhou,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X is the first fully quantized multi-agent system for V2X cooperative perception that reduces computational and transmission costs while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X cooperative perception systems focus on accuracy but neglect efficiency, latency, and real-world deployability, relying on full-precision models that are impractical for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Introduces a unified end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and transmitted message representations to reduce computational load and transmission bandwidth.

Result: QuantV2X achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision systems while reducing system-level latency by 3.2x and improving mAP30 by +9.5 over baselines. It also enables larger models within strict memory budgets.

Conclusion: QuantV2X demonstrates the viability of fully quantized multi-agent intermediate fusion systems for real-world V2X deployment, offering efficient and scalable cooperative perception.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientNetB0 outperforms ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 for plant species classification using leaf venation patterns, achieving 94.67% testing accuracy with excellent generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate deep learning architectures for automated plant species classification based on leaf venation patterns, which are critical morphological features with high taxonomic relevance.

Method: Used three deep learning models (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0) on the Swedish Leaf Dataset containing 1,125 images from 15 species, evaluated using standard performance metrics during training and testing phases.

Result: ResNet50: 94.11% training accuracy but overfitted (88.45% testing, 87.82% F1). MobileNetV2: 93.34% testing accuracy, 93.23% F1, good for lightweight applications. EfficientNetB0: Best performance with 94.67% testing accuracy and all scores exceeding 94.6%.

Conclusion: Deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, shows strong potential for developing scalable and accurate automated plant taxonomy tools using venation traits, with EfficientNetB0 demonstrating superior robustness in classification.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

### [9] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN is an efficient graph comparison method that postpones cross-graph interactions to the end, using a differentiable graph kernel for faster inference while maintaining comparable performance to graph matching networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph matching networks for floor plan comparison rely on costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, making them slow during inference time.

Method: LayoutGKN postpones cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint embedding architecture and uses a differentiable graph kernel as a distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings.

Result: LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks while significantly increasing the speed of inference.

Conclusion: The proposed LayoutGKN approach provides a more efficient alternative to traditional graph matching networks for floor plan graph comparison, achieving similar or better performance with significantly faster inference speeds.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD is a parameter-efficient adaptation method that uses Singular Value Decomposition to fine-tune only 0.04% of CLIP's parameters by modifying singular values, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets while preserving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP struggle with fine-grained domain adaptation due to reliance on prompt engineering and high cost of full fine-tuning. Existing methods add components that limit adaptation quality and destabilize the model.

Method: Leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify CLIP's internal parameter space without adding modules. Only fine-tunes singular values of parameter matrices to rescale basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining pretrained weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets. Outperforms previous methods in accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings using only 0.04% of total parameters.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD provides an effective parameter-efficient adaptation technique that enhances performance while better preserving the model's generalization ability and original knowledge, with added interpretability through language-based analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [11] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed STA-Net with Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) for edge-based plant disease diagnosis, achieving 89% accuracy with only 401K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying high-precision deep learning models on edge devices for plant disease diagnosis, as existing attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition fail to capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex textures.

Method: Twofold approach: 1) Training-free neural architecture search (DeepMAD) to create efficient network backbone; 2) Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) with two branches - deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and Gabor filter bank for texture awareness.

Result: On CCMT plant disease dataset: 89.00% accuracy, 88.96% F1 score with only 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs. STAM significantly outperforms baseline and standard attention models in ablation studies.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge through decoupled attention (shape and texture) provides an effective approach for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI systems.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

### [12] [SLENet: A Guidance-Enhanced Network for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03786)
*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces DeepCamo dataset and SLENet framework for underwater camouflaged object detection, addressing optical distortions and complex marine environments with novel enhancement and localization modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged object detection is critical for marine ecology but remains underexplored due to optical distortions, water turbidity, and complex marine organism traits that hinder accurate identification.

Method: Proposes SLENet framework with Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) module and Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale features and generate semantic-rich location maps, guided by Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD).

Result: SLENet demonstrates superior performance on DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and showing high generality for broader COD tasks.

Conclusion: The DeepCamo dataset and SLENet framework effectively address underwater camouflaged object detection challenges, providing a robust solution with enhanced feature representation and semantic guidance for accurate predictions.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [13] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple training strategy that leverages temporal coherence in video frames to improve diffusion model training, achieving 2x faster convergence and better performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models are trained on static images, which is information-deficient for capturing temporal dynamics, leading to slower convergence, limited coverage, and reduced generalization.

Method: Proposes a training strategy that utilizes temporal inductive bias from continuous video frames, seamlessly integrated into standard diffusion pipelines without architectural modifications.

Result: Achieves over 2x faster convergence, lower FID on both training and validation distributions, and improved generative diversity by capturing meaningful temporal variations. Optimization analysis shows reduced gradient variance.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal coherence in video frames is an effective way to enhance diffusion model training, providing faster convergence and better performance while maintaining compatibility with existing pipelines.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D is a multi-scale vision-language framework for 3D CT analysis that addresses radiologic diagnostic errors through joint local-global understanding and semantic-enriched text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologic diagnostic errors remain prevalent due to missed localized abnormalities, limited global context in 3D imaging, and variability in report language. Existing 3D vision-language models cannot jointly address precise detection, global reasoning, and consistent reporting needs.

Method: MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. It uses language model rewrites and introduces a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment to address report variability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering. Also transfers well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in 3D radiology analysis by enabling joint disease detection and holistic interpretation through multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [15] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL is a causality-guided text prompt learning method that uses visual granulation to improve CLIP's performance on fine-grained recognition tasks by capturing subtle class differences through causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods show limited ability in handling fine-grained datasets, as they struggle to capture subtle discrepancies between similar classes.

Method: Two modules: 1) Attribute disentanglement using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model to separate shared and class-specific attributes; 2) Granule learning module that constructs visual granules by integrating attributes for recognition under causal inference strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show CaPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed causality-guided approach with visual granulation effectively enhances CLIP's discriminative power for fine-grained recognition through more informative text prompts.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

### [16] [EGTM: Event-guided Efficient Turbulence Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03808)
*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EGTM framework using event cameras for turbulence mitigation, achieving 710x smaller model size and 214x faster inference while improving restoration quality with +0.94 PSNR gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning turbulence mitigation methods require high-capacity networks to learn from coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited frame-rate, leading to computational and storage inefficiency.

Method: Presents 'event-lucky insight' revealing correlation between turbulence distortions and event streams, then proposes EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level turbulence-free guidance from turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Built first real-world event-driven TM dataset.

Result: Surpasses existing SOTA by 710x in model size, 214x in inference latency, and 224x in model complexity while achieving state-of-the-art restoration quality (+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Event cameras provide great efficiency merit for turbulence mitigation tasks, fundamentally addressing computational bottlenecks with their microsecond-level temporal resolution and sparse asynchronous imaging mechanism.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

### [17] [Focus Through Motion: RGB-Event Collaborative Token Sparsification for Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03872)
*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba is a novel RGB-Event detection method that uses adaptive collaborative sparsification to efficiently process multimodal features by discarding low-information regions and effectively fusing complementary information from both modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process low-information regions uniformly, leading to high computational costs and suboptimal performance. Fixed token selection methods fail to adapt to varying sample complexity, creating a need for adaptive sparsification.

Method: Proposes Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) to identify and adaptively discard low-information regions using event camera scene change data, and Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) to effectively integrate complementary features from both modalities.

Result: Experiments on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets show superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FocusMamba achieves better balance between accuracy and efficiency through adaptive collaborative sparsification and effective multimodal fusion, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in RGB-Event detection tasks.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: Proposes Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR) with SalientFusion method to address background redundancy, role confusion, and semantic bias in food recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition needs methods for unseen categories, but faces challenges with background distraction, dish role confusion, and semantic bias in zero-shot learning.

Method: SalientFusion with two components: SalientFormer removes background redundancy and uses depth features; DebiasAT reduces semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on proposed benchmarks CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, as well as general CZSL datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key challenges in compositional zero-shot food recognition and demonstrates superior performance on specialized and general benchmarks.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

*Bu Jin,Songen Gu,Xiaotao Hu,Yupeng Zheng,Xiaoyang Guo,Qian Zhang,Xiaoxiao Long,Wei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccTENS is a generative occupancy world model that uses temporal next-scale prediction to enable efficient, high-fidelity long-term 3D occupancy generation with pose controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive approaches for occupancy world modeling suffer from inefficiency, temporal degradation in long-term generation, and lack of controllability, making them impractical for real applications.

Method: Reformulates occupancy modeling as temporal next-scale prediction task, decomposing temporal sequence modeling into spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction using a TensFormer architecture with holistic pose aggregation strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

Conclusion: OccTENS provides an effective solution for controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency, addressing key limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly-supervised learning approach for dense functional correspondence across different object categories using vision-language models and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object function can guide correspondences across different categories since functional parts often share shape and appearance similarities, enabling better matching for tasks like shape reconstruction and robot manipulation.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images for functional parts, then integrate with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model.

Result: The approach demonstrates advantages over baseline solutions using off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models on curated synthetic and real evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly-supervised learning paradigm effectively establishes dense functional correspondence by combining functional part identification through vision-language models with spatial knowledge from contrastive learning.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Motivation: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP excel in zero-shot recognition but struggle with few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline fine-tuning that risks overfitting.

Method: Proposes a dual attention mechanism with Memory Attn-Adapter (refines category embeddings using support examples) and Local-Global Attn-Adapter (enriches image embeddings by integrating local and global features) for dynamic adaptation from few labeled samples.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization while maintaining efficient inference and scaling across CLIP backbones.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter provides an effective online few-shot learning solution that enhances CLIP's adaptability without the computational overhead and overfitting risks of traditional fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but

TL;DR: SPECS is a new efficient reference-free metric for long image caption evaluation that matches LLM-based metrics in human correlation while being much faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for long image captions have limitations: n-gram metrics lack semantic understanding, RS metrics have low human correlation, and LLM-based metrics are too expensive for iterative development.

Method: SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity - rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones in long image captions.

Result: SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments while being significantly more efficient computationally.

Conclusion: SPECS provides a practical and efficient alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Conclusion: Generative foundation models like ChexGen play a transformative role in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding framework that leverages inter-view motion and content correlations to significantly improve compression efficiency while maintaining random access and backward compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview video enables immersive 3D scene reconstruction but poses significant storage and transmission challenges due to massive data volume. While deep learning-based video coding has succeeded for single-view/stereo videos, general multiview scenarios remain underexplored.

Method: Proposes feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction using decoded independent-view motion features, inter-view motion entropy model, disparity-free inter-view context prediction from independent-view content features, and inter-view contextual entropy model to capture inter-view priors.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed LMVC framework outperforms the traditional MV-HEVC standard reference software by a large margin.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong baseline for future research in learned multiview video coding, demonstrating significant compression efficiency improvements while ensuring random access and backward compatibility.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt is a novel framework for topological refinement of 3D tubular structures that addresses limitations of existing methods by using holistic modeling, topological integrity constraints, and curriculum refinement to significantly improve both geometric and topological accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing medical tubular structures rely on voxel-wise overlap measures that fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Patch-wise approaches with topology-aware losses cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors during inference.

Method: TopoSculpt adopts: (1) holistic whole-region modeling to capture full spatial context, (2) Topological Integrity Betti constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (3) curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales.

Result: Substantial improvements on pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets: β₀ errors reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on airways and from 1.65 to 0.30 on CoW. Tree length detected and branch detected rates improved by nearly 10%.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively corrects critical topological errors and advances high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy, demonstrating significant improvements in both geometry and topology preservation.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a

first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging

by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pneumothorax can be life-threatening if undetected, and small cases may be subtle on chest X-rays, requiring automated detection to support radiologists.

Method: U-Net with EfficientNet-B4 encoder trained on SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and combined binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss.

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

### [28] [ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951)
*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANTS uses MLLMs to create adaptive negative textual spaces for improved OOD detection, reducing FPR95 by 4.2% on ImageNet without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods lack understanding of OOD images and suffer from false negative labels that degrade near-OOD performance.

Method: Leverage MLLMs to generate expressive negative sentences from identified OOD images, create visually similar negative labels for near-OOD cases, and use adaptive weighted scoring to handle different OOD settings.

Result: Significantly reduces FPR95 by 4.2% on ImageNet benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ANTS provides training-free, zero-shot OOD detection with high scalability and adaptability to both near and far-OOD settings through MLLM-powered negative space construction.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMChange is a multimodal remote sensing change detection method that combines image and text modalities to improve accuracy and robustness by addressing limitations of image-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing remote sensing change detection methods rely solely on image modality, which limits feature representation, change pattern modeling, and generalization, especially under illumination and noise disturbances.

Method: Proposes MMChange with three key modules: Image Feature Refinement (IFR) to highlight key regions and suppress noise, uses vision language model to generate semantic descriptions, Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) to capture semantic shifts, and Image-Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) to bridge modality heterogeneity.

Result: Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD datasets demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: MMChange validates the effectiveness of multimodal approach for remote sensing change detection, showing improved accuracy and robustness through image-text integration.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAC-MIL is a novel WSI classification method using spatial-aware correlated multiple instance learning with positional encoding and MLP-based full instance correlation in linear time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address WSI classification challenges by incorporating spatial relationships between instances and achieving efficient computation without requiring custom CUDA kernels like Transformer-based methods.

Method: Uses positional encoding module to encode spatial coordinates instead of sequence indices, and SAC block (MLP-based) for full instance correlations with linear time complexity relative to sequence length.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL provides an efficient and effective solution for WSI classification that handles spatial relationships and length extrapolation while being easy to deploy without specialized hardware requirements.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning framework for liver vessel segmentation in non-contrast MRI using auxiliary contrast-enhanced data during training to reduce annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver vessel segmentation is important for analyzing vascular changes in liver diseases, but existing methods require contrast-enhanced imaging which is not always available. Non-contrast MRI is more common but challenging for vessel segmentation and requires large annotated datasets.

Method: Proposes a multi-task learning framework that leverages paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI data (with and without vessel annotations) during training. The approach uses auxiliary contrast-enhanced data to improve feature representation through shared task structure.

Result: Auxiliary contrast-enhanced data improves vessel segmentation accuracy in non-contrast MRI, even when not available during inference. The benefit is most significant when few annotations are available for training. The approach was also validated successfully for brain tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: An auxiliary informative imaging modality can effectively augment expert annotations and improve segmentation performance, even when only available during training and not during actual inference.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt design significantly affects LMM performance in MCQA, with up to 15% accuracy variations. Promptception framework evaluates 10 LMMs across 61 prompt types, revealing proprietary models are more sensitive to phrasing while open-source models are steadier but struggle with complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design for Large Multimodal Models in Multiple-Choice Question Answering remains poorly understood, and minor prompt variations cause significant accuracy deviations, challenging transparent and fair LMM evaluation.

Method: Introduce Promptception framework with 61 prompt types across 15 categories and 6 supercategories to evaluate prompt sensitivity in 10 LMMs (including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro) across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench.

Result: Proprietary models show greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing (reflecting tighter instruction alignment), while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing.

Conclusion: Propose tailored Prompting Principles for proprietary and open-source LMMs to enable more robust and fair model evaluation, addressing prompt sensitivity challenges.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliceSemOcc - a novel vertical slice based multimodal framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that addresses height-axis information neglect in existing methods through global/local vertical slices and SEAttention3D module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D semantic occupancy prediction methods overlook height-axis information when processing voxel features, and conventional channel attention assigns uniform weights across all height layers, limiting their ability to emphasize features at different heights.

Method: Extract voxel features along height-axis using global and local vertical slices, use global local fusion module to reconcile spatial details with contextual information, and propose SEAttention3D module that preserves height-wise resolution through average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets show significant mean IoU improvements, with especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories.

Conclusion: The proposed SliceSemOcc framework effectively addresses height-axis information neglect and significantly enhances 3D semantic occupancy prediction performance, particularly for small objects.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, showing training methodology impacts reliance on spurious signals and identifying problematic ImageNet classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks can exploit unintended patterns (spurious correlations) in data, leading to correct but unreliable predictions based on coincidental signals rather than genuine features.

Method: Proposed detection method for vision transformers using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, with large-scale experiments on ImageNet dataset.

Result: Method successfully identifies spurious correlations; training methodology significantly affects model reliance on spurious signals; certain ImageNet classes contain easily detected spurious signals.

Conclusion: Provides exhaustive list of problematic images for research caution and demonstrates real-world application in breast mass classification, highlighting importance of detecting spurious correlations for trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses real-world applications where only majority labels are available, such as pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring.

Method: Uses Counting Network to estimate bag-level majority labels by counting instances per class. Develops Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) to remove minority class instances and increase majority class proportion.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over conventional MIL methods on four datasets. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of each proposed module.

Conclusion: LML is a valuable problem with practical applications. The proposed Counting Network and MPEM effectively solve the majority label learning problem and outperform existing methods.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Conclusion: Provides an innovative solution for UAV monitoring and domestic chip applications, successfully addressing real-time response challenges in video surveillance through heterogeneous computing architecture.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous re-identification methods rely on single-view images which suffer from view bias, pose variation, viewpoint changes, and occlusions. Multi-view features can help reduce these issues and improve re-ranking accuracy.

Method: K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) method that aggregates neighbors' features in an unsupervised manner to generate multi-view features. Explores weight selection strategies during feature aggregation without requiring model fine-tuning or extra annotations.

Result: Significant improvements in Rank@1 and mAP: 9.8% improvement on MSMT17 and 22.0% improvement on Occluded-DukeMTMC. Also demonstrates substantial computational efficiency enhancements compared to other re-ranking methods.

Conclusion: The proposed KWF re-ranking method effectively reduces view bias by generating multi-view features through neighbor aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets while being computationally efficient and requiring no additional training or annotations.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

TL;DR: Proposes BiT and CATS modules for audio-visual video parsing that combines semantic injection with temporal graph propagation to address noisy pseudo-label issues in weakly supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVVP methods either rely on noisy segment-level pseudo labels or indiscriminate attention mechanisms that amplify initial errors during training, requiring a better approach to handle weakly supervised learning.

Method: Combines Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module for semantic injection and feature purification with Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module for semantic propagation across time frames.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple key indicators across two benchmark datasets (LLP and UnAV-100).

Conclusion: The proposed BiT and CATS modules effectively integrate complementary research directions to improve audio-visual video parsing by addressing noise propagation issues in weakly supervised settings.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Conclusion: DVS-PedX enables accelerated research in event-based pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception, addressing critical gaps in current vision systems for automotive applications.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion is a novel framework for text-to-story visualization that maintains character consistency across frames and accurately renders dialogues through iterative processing and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with character consistency, artifact generation, and inaccurate dialogue rendering, leading to disjointed storytelling in multi-character visual narratives.

Method: Uses pre-trained LLM for frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues; employs bounded attention-based per-box mask technique, identity-consistent self-attention, region-aware cross-attention, and CLIPSeg for dialogue assignment to characters.

Result: Experimental results show TaleDiffusion outperforms existing methods in character consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in text-to-story visualization by maintaining character consistency and accurate dialogue assignment through innovative attention mechanisms and postprocessing techniques.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

*Yuan Zhao,Liu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEPG is a framework that combines LLMs with expert modules to improve text-to-image generation for complex prompts and diverse styles through spatial decomposition and specialized expert routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with complex multi-element prompts and limited stylistic diversity, needing better spatial understanding and style control.

Method: Uses Position-Style-Aware LLM to decompose prompts into spatial coordinates and style instructions, then Multi-Expert Diffusion module with attention-based gating to route specialized experts for different regions.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline models with same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.

Conclusion: MEPG provides effective solution for complex prompt handling and style diversity through synergistic integration of LLMs and expert modules with extensible architecture.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Better hyperparameter tuning of a simple vision backbone approach achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, competing with commercial detectors and surpassing previous baseline results by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform poorly on realistic 'in-the-wild' benchmarks, with open-source models lagging significantly behind commercial solutions (61-69% vs 82% accuracy).

Method: Revisits and improves Ojha et al.'s approach by applying better-tuned hyperparameters to standard pretrained vision backbones for deepfake detection.

Result: Achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark, an 18% improvement over previous baseline results, making it competitive with leading commercial detectors.

Conclusion: Simple vision backbone approaches with proper hyperparameter tuning can achieve state-of-the-art performance, offering practical deepfake detection solutions with good accuracy-computational cost tradeoffs for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: Ensemble of YOLO models combining visible and thermal imagery improves wind turbine defect detection accuracy over single models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs with advanced sensors enable wind power plant monitoring but require high-resolution data and efficient multispectral processing methods for reliable defect detection

Method: Developed ensemble approach integrating general-purpose YOLOv8 with specialized thermal model using bounding box fusion algorithm to combine predictions from visible and thermal channels

Result: Achieved mAP@.5 of 0.93 and F1-score of 0.90, outperforming standalone YOLOv8 model (mAP@.5 of 0.91)

Conclusion: Combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides more reliable solution for detecting both visual and thermal defects in wind turbine components

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

TL;DR: VisioFirm is an open-source web application that uses AI-assisted automation to streamline image labeling, reducing manual annotation effort by up to 90% while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image annotation tools require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. AI models need annotated data to learn patterns, but annotation is labor-intensive for tasks like object detection, bounding box estimation, and segmentation.

Method: VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models with a filtering pipeline, using CLIP with pre-trained detectors for common classes and zero-shot models like Grounding DINO for custom labels. It employs low-confidence thresholding for high recall, interactive refinement tools, and on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything with WebGPU acceleration.

Result: The tool demonstrates up to 90% reduction in manual effort on diverse datasets while maintaining high annotation accuracy. Initial predictions on COCO-type classes are mostly correct, and the system supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) with offline operation after model caching.

Conclusion: VisioFirm provides an effective hybrid approach that significantly reduces human annotation effort through AI-assisted automation, making large-scale image labeling more accessible and efficient while maintaining quality through interactive refinement capabilities.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

*Ruohong Yang,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUDE is a novel unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval method that uses text-to-image generative models to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCIR methods struggle with domain gaps because object features are entangled with domain-specific styles, making cross-domain retrieval challenging without annotations.

Method: DUDE leverages text-to-image generative models to disentangle object features from domain styles, then progressively aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains for reliable feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets spanning 13 different domains.

Conclusion: Feature disentanglement through generative models combined with progressive mutual neighbor alignment effectively addresses the domain gap challenge in unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER is a self-evolving framework that enhances VLMs' multi-step perception for precise coordinate prediction in GUI grounding tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ScreenSpot benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling VLMs to effectively reason over appropriate image regions remains challenging in GUI grounding, especially with high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions.

Method: Integrates Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region quality evaluation to construct high-quality preference data, guiding models to focus on instruction-relevant regions and adapt reasoning steps based on task complexity.

Result: Achieves 55.7 score on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark with GTA1-7B model, establishing new state-of-the-art among 7B-scale models with consistent performance gains on ScreenSpot benchmarks.

Conclusion: LASER framework effectively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities for precise coordinate prediction, demonstrating significant improvements in GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

### [48] [Differential Morphological Profile Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04268)
*David Huangal,J. Alex Hurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating multi-scale shape features (DMP) into semantic segmentation networks improves performance on overhead remote sensing imagery by addressing scale variation and shape information challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation networks are optimized for ground-perspective photos and don't handle remote sensing challenges like extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes that are common in overhead imagery.

Method: Incorporated Differential Morphological Profile (DMP) features into three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using both direct input (adapting input stems) and hybrid dual-stream designs that fuse RGB and DMP encoders. Evaluated various DMP differentials and structuring element shapes on the iSAID dataset.

Result: Hybrid DMP architectures consistently outperformed direct-input variants and were capable of surpassing non-DMP models on mIoU, F1, and Recall metrics.

Conclusion: Multi-scale shape features from DMP provide critical shape information that enhances semantic segmentation performance in overhead remote sensing imagery when properly integrated through hybrid fusion architectures.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided 3D diffusion model that synthesizes tau PET images using structural MRI and plasma p-tau217 measurements as multimodal inputs, providing a cost-effective alternative to actual tau PET scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tau PET scans are crucial for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis but are expensive and limited in availability, while structural MRI and plasma biomarkers are more accessible and provide complementary information.

Method: Proposes a 3D diffusion model that uses textual prompts from plasma p-tau217 measurements and anatomical constraints from structural MRI to synthesize realistic 3D tau PET images.

Result: The framework successfully generates clinically meaningful 3D tau PET images across various disease stages using ADNI data, demonstrating realistic synthesis capabilities.

Conclusion: This approach enables tau PET data augmentation, provides a non-invasive cost-effective visualization alternative, and supports disease progression simulation under different biomarker levels and cognitive conditions.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that integrates spatial regularization and volume priors using Wasserstein distance constraints at both image and dataset scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing semi-supervised medical image segmentation networks overlook effective methodological guidance for feature extraction and important prior information from datasets.

Method: Integrates explicit volume prior at image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization into backbone segmentation network. Uses regression network to estimate target region volumes and applies Wasserstein distance constraints to ensure class ratios match predictions. Also includes dataset-scale Wasserstein loss based on weak implicit volume prior.

Result: Experimental results on 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset show superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages volume priors and spatial regularization to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view images without camera pose supervision


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, which limits practical applications. This work aims to operate with minimal views (as few as 4) and no camera supervision.

Method: First reconstruct each articulation independently using sparse-view 3D reconstruction, then learn deformation field for cross-pose correspondences. Uses progressive disentanglement to separate static/moving parts and joint optimization of geometry, appearance, and kinematics with self-supervised consistency losses.

Result: Produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing approaches

Conclusion: The method successfully learns articulated object representations from sparse, unposed images, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness on standard benchmarks and real-world examples

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Motivation: Semantic noise in image classification datasets where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled poses challenges to supervised learning approaches.

Method: Leverage synthetic images generated by text-to-image models as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets, rather than using them directly for training.

Result: Improves classification accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses semantic label noise and is orthogonal to existing noise-robust techniques, achieving superior performance when combined with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena is an open platform that addresses data leakage and privacy issues in image geolocalization evaluation by using in-the-wild images and human pairwise judgments instead of exact coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image geolocalization evaluation suffers from data leakage (LVLMs pretrained on test data) and privacy concerns with exact coordinate metrics that neglect reasoning processes.

Method: Developed GeoArena platform that allows users to upload in-the-wild images and uses pairwise human judgments to evaluate which model outputs better align with human expectations.

Result: Deployed online for 2 months, collected thousands of voting records, conducted detailed analysis, and established a leaderboard for different LVLMs on image geolocalization.

Conclusion: GeoArena provides a more accurate, privacy-preserving, and human-centered benchmarking approach for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FE2E is a framework that adapts image editing models (rather than text-to-image generators) for dense geometry estimation, achieving significant performance improvements in monocular depth and normal estimation without additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting image editing models may be more suitable than text-to-image generative models as a foundation for fine-tuning in geometry estimation tasks.

Method: Adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, reformulates flow matching loss into "consistent velocity" training objective, uses logarithmic quantization for precision, and leverages DiT's global attention for joint depth and normal estimation in a single forward pass.

Result: Achieves over 35% performance gains on ETH3D dataset and outperforms DepthAnything series trained on 100x more data, with impressive zero-shot performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Image editing models possess inherent structural priors that make them superior to generative models for dense geometry estimation tasks, enabling stable convergence and higher performance through feature refinement.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

TL;DR: MICACL is a novel multi-instance learning framework for dynamic facial expression recognition that addresses long-tailed distributions and spatio-temporal complexity through graph-enhanced instance interaction, weighted aggregation, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFER methods struggle with long-tailed category distributions and complex spatio-temporal feature modeling, leading to severe model induction bias that limits performance.

Method: Proposes MICACL framework with: 1) Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM) using adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions, 2) Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN) for dynamic importance-based weighting, 3) Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) strategy for balanced training.

Result: Extensive experiments on DFEW and FERV39k datasets show MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MICACL effectively addresses key challenges in DFER through integrated spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning optimization, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline that converts body-camera footage into panoramic images for rapid situational awareness by using SLAM for camera tracking, clustering key viewpoints, and stitching representative frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First responders need quick visual summaries from body-camera footage for time-critical decision making, as reviewing lengthy videos is impractical during emergencies.

Method: Uses monocular SLAM to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct environment layout, clusters camera poses to identify key viewpoints, selects representative frames, and applies multi-frame stitching to create spatially coherent panoramic images.

Result: The system generates informative panoramic summaries that enable rapid understanding of complex environments from body-camera footage.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates efficient decision-making and incident review by providing concise visual summaries that can be quickly interpreted in time-critical situations.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnomalyLMM is the first framework using Large Multi-modal Models for text-based person anomaly search, achieving +0.96% Recall@1 improvement over baselines through training-free adaptation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples in public safety applications.

Method: Coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs with masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking for zero-shot anomaly detection without training.

Result: Surpasses competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy on PAB dataset, with interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors demonstrated through qualitative analysis.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection, enabling effective zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues for person anomaly search.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASE-MLLM is a novel framework that integrates aesthetic saliency into multimodal large language models for aesthetic image captioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance by explicitly focusing on aesthetic content rather than just fine-tuning existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIC works using MLLMs rely on fine-tuning without specifically adapting models to focus on aesthetic content, and most image aesthetics research focuses on rating prediction rather than caption generation.

Method: Proposes ASE-MLLM with Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) to extract aesthetic saliency features, and IAS-ViT encoder that fuses aesthetic saliency with original image features via cross-attention mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show ASE-MLLM significantly outperforms traditional methods and generic MLLMs on mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks, effectively addressing the limitation of existing approaches that don't focus on target aesthetic content.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D style transfer pipeline that uses 2D diffusion priors to generate stylized key views with cross-view attention and instance-level consistency, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods struggle with extracting high-level style semantics from reference images and often produce results lacking structural clarity and instance separation, making it difficult to distinguish different objects in 3D scenes.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints with cross-view style alignment (inserting cross-view attention in UNet), 2) Transfer stylized key views to 3D representation with instance-level style transfer that maintains consistency across views.

Result: The method produces more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various scenes including forward-facing and 360-degree environments.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively integrates 2D diffusion priors with innovative cross-view attention and instance-level consistency mechanisms, successfully addressing limitations of existing 3D style transfer approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray ptychography's nanoscale resolution is limited by the challenge of accurate image reconstruction when the illuminating probe is unknown, especially under low-signal conditions that compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict broader adoption.

Method: Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR) parameterizes both object and probe as continuous neural representations, performing end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without probe pre-characterization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions.

Conclusion: PtyINR provides a generalizable, physics-informed framework for probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems beyond X-ray ptychography.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk-oriented dataset construction methods fail to cover the complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios and lack unified evaluation metrics

Method: Image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction starting with images and creating paired text with guidance responses, plus fine-tuning a safety judge model for standardized evaluation

Result: Generated RMS dataset with 35k image-text pairs and demonstrated effectiveness through extensive experiments on various tasks

Conclusion: The image-oriented approach proves scalable and effective, offering a new perspective for real-world multimodal safety dataset construction

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

TL;DR: MDT-dist framework accelerates 3D flow generation by distilling pretrained models to learn Marginal-Data Transport, reducing sampling steps from 25 to 1-2 while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based 3D generation models require many sampling steps during inference, and few-step distillation methods for accelerating diffusion models remain under-explored for complex 3D generation tasks.

Method: Proposes Velocity Matching (VM) to match velocity fields between student and teacher models, and Velocity Distillation (VD) to enhance optimization using learned velocity fields for probability density distillation.

Result: Reduces sampling steps from 25 to 1-2, achieving 0.68s (1 step) and 0.94s (2 steps) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800 while preserving visual and geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: The method significantly outperforms existing Consistency Model distillation methods and enables superior performance in few-step 3D generation for the TRELLIS framework.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

TL;DR: Durian is a zero-shot portrait animation method that transfers facial attributes from reference images to target portraits using dual reference networks in a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent facial attribute transfer across video frames without explicit triplet supervision, addressing the challenge of maintaining consistency in portrait animation.

Method: Uses dual reference networks to inject spatial features from both portrait and attribute images into diffusion denoising. Trained with self-reconstruction from same video frames, mask expansion strategy, and spatial/appearance transformations for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, enables multi-attribute composition in single generation without additional training.

Conclusion: Durian successfully enables zero-shot facial attribute transfer for portrait animation with high fidelity and spatial consistency, demonstrating effective generalization across diverse attributes and real-world reference combinations.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based segmentation using differentiable Hough transform to detect collimator shadows in X-ray images, achieving robust reconstruction with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collimation reduces radiation dose by restricting exposure to ROI, but detecting collimator shadows is challenging when edges are obscured by scattered radiation. Prior knowledge that collimation forms polygonal shadows can be leveraged.

Method: Differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect collimation borders and extract ROI center information. Combines both tasks during inference to generate line-constrained segmentation masks.

Result: Achieved median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real X-ray images, demonstrating robust reconstruction of collimated regions.

Conclusion: Method effectively detects collimator shadows using geometry constraints, is not limited by specific number of edges, and provides accurate ROI segmentation for radiation dose reduction.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCF-UM introduces a cyclic evaluation framework to measure semantic drift in unified visual language models when alternating between image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, revealing significant variations in cross-modal consistency that single-pass metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for unified visual language models only assess image-to-text and text-to-image capabilities in isolation, failing to measure whether models can maintain semantic consistency when cycling between modalities.

Method: UCF-UM uses a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations, with three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (embedding-based semantic loss), Semantic Drift Rate (decay rate), and Multi-Generation GenEval (object-level compliance).

Result: Evaluation on seven models using ND400 benchmark shows substantial variation in cross-modal stability - some models maintain semantics over many alternations while others drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores.

Conclusion: Cyclic consistency is a necessary complement to standard evaluations, providing practical metrics to assess unified models' cross-modal stability and the strength of their shared representations.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception in applications like VR, autonomous driving, and robotics, with ODIs providing 360° field of view but presenting unique challenges compared to perspective images.

Method: Revisits panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods, analyzes structural disparities, summarizes three key domain adaptation challenges (geometric distortions, non-uniform sampling, boundary continuity), and categorizes panoramic vision into four major categories across 20+ tasks.

Result: Comprehensive survey covering 300+ research papers with cross-method analysis of strategies for panoramic challenges and cross-task comparison across visual quality enhancement, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications to advance panoramic vision research, providing insights and forward-looking perspectives for technology development.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

TL;DR: Plot'n Polish is a zero-shot framework for consistent story visualization that provides fine-grained control over image generation and editing while maintaining narrative consistency across frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models lack flexibility for applying fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing seamless crafting and refinement of visual stories.

Method: A zero-shot framework called Plot'n Polish that enables consistent story generation with fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail.

Result: The framework addresses the challenge of providing enhanced control, refinement, and post-generation modification capabilities while maintaining consistency in visual storytelling.

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish offers a solution to the important challenge of maintaining visual and narrative consistency while enabling flexible editing in story visualization applications.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing

lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST-VL is a unified vision-language model for multimodal misinformation detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance through joint training across distortion types and a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal misinformation (textual, visual, cross-modal distortions) amplified by generative AI poses increasing societal threats. Existing methods focus on single distortion types and struggle with generalization to unseen scenarios.

Method: Introduces TRUST-VL with Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module for task-specific visual features. Uses TRUST-Instruct dataset (198K samples) with structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows for joint training across distortion types.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and interpretability capabilities.

Conclusion: Joint training across different distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances model generalization, making TRUST-VL an effective unified solution for multimodal misinformation detection.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: VFR is a novel video generative model for long virtual try-on videos using segment-by-segment generation with prefix video conditions and anchor videos for smoothness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generation of arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos without resource-intensive processing or lengthy video data requirements.

Method: Auto-regressive segment-by-segment generation with prefix video conditions for local smoothness and anchor videos (360-degree wholebody captures) for global temporal consistency.

Result: Successfully generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions.

Conclusion: VFR represents a pioneering approach for long virtual try-on video generation, addressing key challenges of segment smoothness and temporal consistency.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

*Weizhi Chen,Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Sheng Zhou,Xiaoxuan Tang,Jiajun Bu,Yong Li,Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes PG-Agent, a GUI agent framework that transforms sequential operation episodes into page graphs to better capture complex page transitions and uses RAG technology with multi-agent task decomposition for improved generalization to unseen scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents using sequential multi-step operations fail to capture complex page transition relationships, making it challenging for agents to deeply perceive GUI environments and generalize to new scenarios.

Method: An automated pipeline transforms sequential episodes into page graphs that explicitly model graph structures. RAG technology retrieves reliable GUI perception guidelines from these graphs, and a multi-agent framework (PG-Agent) with task decomposition strategy utilizes these guidelines.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PG-Agent, showing strong performance even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Conclusion: The proposed PG-Agent framework successfully addresses the limitations of sequential episode approaches by leveraging page graphs and RAG technology, enabling better GUI environment perception and generalization to unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

*João P. Arroyo,João G. Rodrigues,Daniel Lawand,Denis D. Mauá,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Alex Gray,Eduardo R. Laurentino,Fabio G. Cozman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: New algorithm for computing tight probability bounds in quasi-Markovian causal models with partial identifiability, using column generation and linear integer programming for single-intervention scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of computing probability bounds in causal models where exogenous variables are not fully specified, leading to partial identifiability issues where exact probabilities cannot be determined.

Method: Develops a column generation approach that constructs auxiliary linear integer programs to compute probability bounds, exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables and focusing on single-intervention scenarios in quasi-Markovian SCMs.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates that polynomial cardinality representation for exogenous variables is possible, and experiments show column generation techniques outperform existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed column generation method provides an efficient approach for computing tight probability bounds in partially identifiable causal models, offering superior performance compared to traditional multilinear programming approaches.

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

### [73] [Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550)
*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Diffusion-AC, a novel autonomous conflict resolution framework that integrates diffusion probabilistic models to overcome unimodal bias in DRL approaches, enabling multimodal decision-making for air traffic conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches for Conflict Detection and Resolution suffer from unimodal bias, leading to decision deadlocks and lack of flexibility when facing complex dynamic constraints in air traffic management.

Method: Integrates diffusion probabilistic models into CD&R, modeling policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function to generate multimodal action distribution. Uses Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC) for stable training from sparse to high-density traffic environments.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. In high-density scenarios, achieves 94.1% success rate and reduces Near Mid-Air Collisions by approximately 59% compared to best baseline, enhancing safety margin through flexible multimodal decision-making.

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC framework successfully overcomes unimodal bias limitations in conventional DRL approaches, providing high-quality multimodal decision-making capabilities that significantly improve safety and performance in complex air traffic conflict resolution scenarios.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training LLM agents to dynamically decide when to plan during test-time, improving efficiency and performance on long-horizon tasks compared to always-planning or never-planning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ReAct force LLMs to always plan before every action, which is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning limits performance.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning on synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, 2) reinforcement learning to refine this capability in long-horizon environments.

Result: Dynamic planning agents are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives in the Crafter environment, and can be effectively steered by human-written plans.

Conclusion: This work pioneers training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation, enabling more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

TL;DR: KG-SMILE is a perturbation-based framework that provides interpretability for Graph RAG systems by identifying influential graph entities and relations through controlled perturbations and similarity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems improve accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge but remain opaque black boxes, limiting reliability in sensitive domains like healthcare where precision is vital.

Method: Developed a method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework using SMILE that applies controlled perturbations, computes similarities, and trains weighted linear surrogates to identify influential graph entities and relations.

Result: KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned explanations and demonstrates strong performance across comprehensive attribution metrics including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances model effectiveness with interpretability, fostering greater transparency and trust in machine learning technologies, particularly for Graph RAG systems.

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of AI reasoning adaptation to novel problems under limited data and distribution shift by creating a structured evaluation framework.

Method: Develops CausalARC with fully specified causal world models as structural causal models, providing observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback through few-shot in-context learning demonstrations.

Result: The framework enables evaluation across four settings: abstract reasoning with test-time training, counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, program synthesis, and causal discovery with logical reasoning.

Conclusion: CausalARC serves as a proof-of-concept testbed for comprehensive evaluation of language models' reasoning capabilities in causal and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Embodied-LM is a neurosymbolic system that grounds LLM reasoning in image schemas (spatial cognitive patterns) using Answer Set Programming, improving logical deduction with better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack robust mental representations for logical reasoning and often make errors, unlike humans who use embodied cognitive structures derived from sensorimotor experience.

Method: The system uses image schemas (recurring spatial patterns) and formalizes them through declarative spatial reasoning in Answer Set Programming to guide LLMs in scenario interpretation.

Result: LLMs can be effectively guided to use embodied cognitive structures, which can be formalized as executable programs that support enhanced logical reasoning with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The prototype establishes a computational foundation for incorporating more complex dynamic representations, showing promise for bridging the gap between LLM capabilities and human-like reasoning through embodied cognitive structures.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enhances LLM reasoning through emergent hierarchical planning, with HICRA algorithm focusing optimization on strategic tokens to outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms of how RL improves LLM reasoning abilities and address inefficiencies in current RL algorithms that apply optimization pressure indiscriminately.

Method: Analysis of RL dynamics in LLMs, identification of two-phase learning process, and development of HICRA algorithm that focuses optimization on high-impact planning tokens while using semantic entropy for strategic exploration measurement.

Result: HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines like GRPO, demonstrating that concentrating optimization on strategic bottlenecks is key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RL success in LLMs stems from emergent reasoning hierarchy similar to human cognition, and targeted optimization on planning tokens (HICRA) with semantic entropy measurement provides superior performance over agnostic approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

*Davide Italo Serramazza,Nikos Papadeas,Zahraa Abdallah,Georgiana Ifrim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates time series segmentation strategies for SHAP-based explainable AI, finding that segment count matters more than segmentation method, with equal-length segmentation performing best and a novel length-weighted normalization improving attribution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP is computationally expensive for long time series, and while feature aggregation via segmentation helps, the optimal segmentation strategy remains unknown.

Method: Evaluated eight time series segmentation algorithms using InterpretTime and AUC Difference metrics on multivariate and univariate time series, plus introduced a length-weighted attribution normalization technique.

Result: Number of segments has greater impact than segmentation method; equal-length segmentation outperforms custom algorithms; length-weighted normalization consistently improves attribution quality.

Conclusion: Simple equal-length segmentation is effective for SHAP-based time series explanations, and segment length normalization enhances attribution quality across different segmentation approaches.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaTeaming introduces personas into automated red-teaming to improve attack success rates by up to 144.1% while maintaining prompt diversity, addressing the gap in identity consideration in current automated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated red-teaming approaches don't consider the role of identity and background, which human red-teamers use to uncover different risks. This limits the effectiveness and diversity of automated risk discovery.

Method: Developed PersonaTeaming method that uses 'red-teaming expert' and 'regular AI user' personas to mutate prompts, with a dynamic persona-generating algorithm adaptive to different seed prompts. Introduced new metrics to measure mutation distance.

Result: Experiments showed promising improvements of up to 144.1% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art RainbowPlus method, while maintaining prompt diversity.

Conclusion: Persona mutation significantly enhances automated red-teaming effectiveness. Different persona types and mutation methods have complementary strengths, offering opportunities to bridge automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show personality-like traits that stabilize with training alignment, but self-reported traits don't reliably predict actual behavior, and persona interventions affect self-reports more than behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically characterize LLM personality across training evolution, behavioral validation of self-reports, and impact of interventions like persona injection, as prior work relied on simplified self-reports without behavioral validation.

Method: Analyzed LLM personality across three dimensions: trait emergence throughout training stages, predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks, and impact of targeted interventions like persona injection on both self-reports and behavior.

Result: Instructional alignment (RLHF, instruction tuning) stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations similar to humans, but self-reported traits don't reliably predict behavior, and persona injection affects self-reports more than actual behavior.

Conclusion: Findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality, showing distinction between surface-level trait expression and behavioral consistency, underscoring need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Method: Developed a study to reveal agents' internal states and examine their behavior in basic dialogue settings, testing behavioral hypotheses about consistency between conversation behavior and revealed internal states.

Result: Found significant internal inconsistencies across all tested LLM model families and sizes, showing agents fail to maintain consistent behaviors despite generating human-like survey responses.

Conclusion: LLMs cannot accurately substitute for real human participants in research due to fundamental internal inconsistencies, representing a critical limitation in their capabilities.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAGuard is an enhanced RAG framework that integrates safety-critical documents with technical manuals using parallel queries and separate retrieval budgets to improve safety coverage while maintaining technical accuracy in offshore wind maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LLMs often fail in highly specialized or unexpected scenarios in offshore wind maintenance, where accuracy and safety are paramount. There's a need to ensure both technical depth and safety coverage in critical maintenance contexts.

Method: RAGuard uses parallel queries to two indices (knowledge and safety) with separate retrieval budgets. SafetyClamp extension fetches larger candidate pool with hard-clamping exact slot guarantees to safety. Evaluated across sparse (BM25), dense (DPR) and hybrid retrieval paradigms.

Result: Both RAGuard extensions increased Safety Recall@K from almost 0% in standard RAG to over 50%, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60%.

Conclusion: RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain planning involves complex coordination across multiple entities and requires dynamic adjustment to environmental changes while maintaining interpretability and reliability. The rapid development of large language models provides new opportunities to address these practical challenges.

Method: Constructed a Supply Chain Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge, comprehend operator needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create tools, and return evidence-based planning reports.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates the practical application of LLM agents in supply chain management, providing an effective solution for complex planning problems with measurable improvements in efficiency and performance metrics.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved

TL;DR: MPDF framework enables LLM agents to learn adaptive meta-cognitive policies (Persist/Refine/Concede) using novel SoftRankPO algorithm, achieving 4-5% accuracy gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems use fixed collaboration protocols that overlook agents' internal deliberative capabilities and meta-cognitive states like uncertainty, treating agents as passive executors rather than adaptive reasoners.

Method: Introduced Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF) where agents learn decentralized policies over meta-cognitive actions. Developed SoftRankPO algorithm that stabilizes training by shaping advantages based on rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles.

Result: Achieved 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.

Conclusion: Presents a paradigm shift from designing fixed protocols to learning dynamic, deliberative strategies for multi-agent LLM systems, enabling adaptive meta-cognitive policies.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for social policymaking on homelessness when combined with expert collaboration and responsible guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether LLMs can align with domain experts to inform social policymaking for homelessness alleviation, affecting over 150 million people worldwide.

Method: Developed a novel benchmark with decision scenarios across four geographies, grounded in Capability Approach framework. Created automated pipeline connecting policies to agent-based model for social impact simulation.

Result: Reveals promising potential for LLMs in social policymaking when responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced with local experts.

Conclusion: LLMs can provide valuable insights and alternative policies at scale for homelessness alleviation when properly calibrated with domain expertise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: A zero-training system using Model Context Protocol to prevent LLM hallucination in medical term mapping to OMOP CDM, improving efficiency and accuracy without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping source medical terms to OMOP standard concepts is resource-intensive and error-prone, and existing LLMs tend to hallucinate making them unsuitable for clinical use without extensive training and validation.

Method: Developed a system based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework that allows LLMs to interact with external resources and tools for real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning, preventing hallucinations without requiring training.

Result: The system enables explainable mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort, providing outputs suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Conclusion: The MCP-based zero-training system effectively prevents LLM hallucination in medical term mapping, making large-scale multi-institutional research more feasible by improving standardization efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

TL;DR: AI-powered framework analyzes tourist perception in historic urban quarters using social media data, combining visual focus, color analysis, and sentiment mining to reveal gaps between expectations and reality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding tourist perception is essential for sustainable urban planning in historic quarters, as these areas preserve cultural heritage while serving tourism and daily life.

Method: Multimodal framework integrating focal point extraction from photos (semantic segmentation), color theme analysis (clustering), and hybrid sentiment analysis (rule-based + BERT model) on social media data from 12 Shanghai historic quarters.

Result: Reveals spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response, identifies divergence between social media photos and real street views, and assesses satisfaction across four dimensions: activities, built environment, services, and business formats.

Conclusion: Provides integrated data-driven approach for decoding tourist perception, supporting informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and public space design.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability concerns in Generative AI (hallucinations, semantic drift, biases) by overcoming limitations of subjective human evaluation and black-box nature of current models.

Method: Constructs two parallel Knowledge Graphs: deterministic KG using rule-based methods and predefined ontologies, and LLM-generated KG from real-time textual data. Uses KG metrics (ICR, IPR, CI) to quantify deviations and establishes dynamic anomaly thresholds for automated real-time monitoring.

Result: Develops a framework that continuously computes deviations between deterministic and LLM-generated KGs, enabling proactive identification of semantic anomalies and hallucinations.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, scalable, and transparent evaluation framework for Generative AI reliability through structured, metric-driven comparison of knowledge representations.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: E&E is a hybrid exploration strategy combining local novelty search with goal-directed expeditions using VLMs to discover diverse patterns in cellular automata, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional novelty search methods plateau in high-dimensional behavioral spaces of cellular automata, failing to reach distant unexplored regions and discover truly diverse patterns.

Method: Alternates between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions using Vision-Language Models to generate linguistic goals that drive exploration toward uncharted regions in semantic spaces.

Result: E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than existing methods in Flow Lenia CA, with expeditions disproportionately influencing long-term exploration and unlocking new behavioral niches.

Conclusion: E&E effectively breaks through local novelty boundaries and explores behavioral landscapes in human-aligned, interpretable ways, offering a promising approach for open-ended exploration.

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Motivation: Simplify complex GUI navigation on C2C platforms that makes marketplace interactions time-consuming for both buyers and sellers.

Method: Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA) - a conversational AI agent that interprets natural language commands to automate high-friction workflows like listing updates, bulk messaging, and product discovery.

Result: 98% task success rate on complex marketplace tasks and up to 2x speedup in interaction time compared to traditional interfaces.

Conclusion: Agentic conversational paradigm provides lightweight, accessible alternative to traditional app interfaces, enabling more efficient marketplace management.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1 is a medical foundation model for chest X-ray interpretation that provides transparent reasoning with local region grounding, achieving significant improvements in report generation and visual question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical foundation models generate answers in a black-box manner without transparent reasoning processes, lacking interpretability which hinders clinical deployment.

Method: Sequential training pipeline: fine-tuning on CXR instruction data, exposure to synthetic reasoning samples for cold-start reasoning, and online reinforcement learning refinement to enhance grounded reasoning quality.

Result: Substantial improvements in report generation (14.54% over LLaVA-Rad, 31.32% over MedGemma) and visual question answering (57.75% over MedGemma, 23.06% over CheXagent). Expert review shows superior interpretability (0.7416 vs 0.2584 preference over Qwen2.5-VL-7B).

Conclusion: DeepMedix-R1 advances medical foundation models toward holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR interpretation with improved interpretability and performance.

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

TL;DR: A novel best-first heuristic search algorithm that explicitly treats control parameters as decision points rather than constraints, using delayed partial expansion to efficiently handle infinite decision spaces in automated planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat control parameters as embedded constraints rather than true decision points in the search space, limiting their effectiveness in automated planning problems with continuous numeric variables.

Method: Developed a best-first heuristic search algorithm with delayed partial expansion, where states are incrementally expanded by generating subsets of successors to handle infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates competitive performance against existing approaches for solving planning problems with control parameters, with proven completeness under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Explicitly treating control parameters as decision points within a systematic search scheme with delayed partial expansion provides an efficient and competitive alternative to constraint-based approaches in automated planning.

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of enabling embodied AI agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining.

Method: Prototype-based world model retrieval with trajectory-based abstract representation matching, plus world-wise compound attention to integrate knowledge and align representations.

Result: Superior zero-shot and few-shot performance on VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks compared to LLM-based approaches across unseen domains.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios requiring adaptability and data efficiency.

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

TL;DR: Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR) is a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into structured Meta-Policy Memory for improved agent performance without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reflective strategies produce ephemeral task-specific traces that aren't reused, while RL alternatives require substantial compute. MPR aims to create reusable corrective knowledge while maintaining adaptability.

Method: MPR uses predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory with soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks to externalize knowledge and enforce domain constraints.

Result: Empirical results show consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness compared to Reflexion baselines, with rule admissibility further improving stability.

Conclusion: MPR successfully externalizes reusable knowledge without model updates, enforces constraints to reduce invalid actions, and retains language-based reflection adaptability, with potential for multimodal extensions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local search solvers for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization require significant expert effort and manual tuning, while LLMs have shown potential in automating algorithm design but haven't been applied to optimizing PBO solvers.

Method: AutoPBO uses Large Language Models to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers through automated algorithm design and optimization.

Result: AutoPBO demonstrates significant improvements over previous local search approaches and maintains competitive performance compared to six state-of-the-art competitors across four public benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating local search solver design for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization problems.

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

### [97] [CoT-Space: A Theoretical Framework for Internal Slow-Thinking via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04027)
*Zeyu Gan,Hao Yi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT-Space is a theoretical framework that transforms LLM reasoning from discrete token prediction to continuous optimization in semantic space, explaining optimal Chain-of-Thought length convergence through underfitting-overfitting trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional token-level RL frameworks don't align with multi-step reasoning processes like Chain-of-Thought, creating a theoretical gap in understanding LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces CoT-Space framework that recasts LLM reasoning as optimization in continuous reasoning-level semantic space, analyzed from noise and risk perspectives.

Result: Demonstrates convergence to optimal CoT length is natural consequence of underfitting-overfitting trade-off, with extensive experiments validating theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Provides coherent explanation for empirical phenomena like overthinking and offers solid theoretical foundation for developing more effective reasoning agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

TL;DR: Oruga is an implementation of Representational Systems Theory (RST) that enables flexible representation transformations through structure transfer, aiming to make machines more compatible with human-like representation usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness human-like flexible representation capabilities (diagrams, analogies, representation changes) and endow machines with this power to make them more compatible with human use.

Method: Developed Oruga system with core data structures based on RST concepts, a communication language, and an engine for structure transfer transformations.

Result: Created a functional implementation of RST principles with core structures, language interface, and transformation engine capable of executing representation transformations.

Conclusion: Oruga successfully implements key aspects of RST and demonstrates the feasibility of structure transfer for enabling flexible representation transformations in machines.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

*Alexander Beiser,David Penz,Nysret Musliu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The choice of formal language significantly impacts neurosymbolic LLM reasoning performance across different models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at many tasks, their formal reasoning abilities remain limited. Neurosymbolic approaches combine LLMs with symbolic solvers, but the factors contributing to their success are not well understood, particularly the role of formal language selection.

Method: Compared four formal languages across three datasets and seven different LLMs to evaluate how formal language choice affects syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities in neurosymbolic reasoning systems.

Result: The choice of formal language significantly impacts both syntactic and semantic reasoning performance, with varying effects observed across different LLMs.

Conclusion: The intermediate language challenge - selecting appropriate formal languages - is a crucial but previously overlooked factor in neurosymbolic LLM reasoning that requires careful consideration for optimal performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

### [100] [Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Search for Flight Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04100)
*Alberto Luise,Michele Lombardi,Florent Teichteil Koenigsbuch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-guided path planning speeds up airline emergency route optimization by 50% while maintaining fuel efficiency within 1% of optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency situations require fast route re-calculation for airliners, where conventional path planners may be too slow for time-critical decisions.

Method: Train RL agent to pre-compute near-optimal paths using location and atmospheric data, then use these paths to constrain traditional path planning solvers and reduce search space.

Result: Empirical tests with Airbus aircraft models show fuel consumption deviations within 1% of unconstrained solver, while computation speed improves by up to 50%.

Conclusion: Combining RL with search-based planners provides significant speed improvements for emergency route optimization without substantial fuel efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study examines bluffing behavior in DQN and CFR algorithms playing Leduc Hold'em poker, finding both exhibit bluffing but with different styles and similar success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bluffing is essential in poker but often overlooked in computer-poker research that focuses mainly on win rates rather than strategic behavior like bluffing.

Method: Designed experiment where DQN (reinforcement learning) and CFR (game theory) agents play against each other in Leduc Hold'em while logging their actions to analyze bluffing behavior.

Result: Both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior but in different ways - they attempt bluffs at different rates, though the percentage of successful bluffs (opponent folds) is roughly the same.

Conclusion: Bluffing is an essential aspect of the game itself rather than being algorithm-specific. Future work should explore different bluffing styles and full poker games.

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

*William Stewart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI systems may surpass human capabilities but lack the biological central nervous system needed for emotional experience and ethical understanding, making humans uniquely qualified for universal leadership.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that AI superiority in cognitive abilities would justify AI leadership, by highlighting the fundamental biological difference that enables human ethical reasoning.

Method: Philosophical analysis comparing human biological systems (CNS) with artificial systems, focusing on emotional experience and ethical development capabilities.

Result: Identifies that while AI may exceed human cognitive performance, the biological CNS enabling emotional experience and ethical understanding cannot be replicated in silicon-based systems.

Conclusion: Human biological systems, particularly the CNS that enables emotional experience and ethical reasoning, provide a superior foundation for universal leadership compared to artificial intelligence systems, regardless of their cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

### [104] [Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192)
*Vera Koponen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of Markov logic networks (MLNs) as domain size approaches infinity, examining three specific cases: quantifier-free MLNs with unary relations, triangle/clique-minimizing MLNs, and degree-constraining MLNs, showing varied asymptotic behaviors and incomparability with lifted Bayesian networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how probability distributions defined by Markov logic networks behave as the domain size becomes infinitely large, and to characterize the limit behaviors of random structures under different types of soft constraints.

Method: Theoretical analysis of three concrete MLN examples: (1) quantifier-free MLNs with single unary relation, (2) MLNs favoring graphs with fewer triangles/k-cliques, (3) MLNs favoring graphs with fewer high-degree vertices. Examines asymptotic properties and compares with lifted Bayesian networks.

Result: Different MLN types exhibit distinct asymptotic behaviors - weights may or may not influence limit behavior. Quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks are asymptotically incomparable. MLN distributions concentrate probability mass differently than uniform distributions on large domains.

Conclusion: MLNs demonstrate varied asymptotic behaviors depending on constraint types, showing that soft constraint weights can significantly impact or have no effect on limit distributions. The formalism is fundamentally different from lifted Bayesian networks in asymptotic properties.

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo is an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in LLM negotiations, outperforming baseline strategies with higher success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents overlook the functional role of emotions in negotiations, generating passive emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation.

Method: Models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios.

Result: EvoEmo consistently outperforms both vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings.

Conclusion: Adaptive emotional expression is crucial for enabling more effective LLM agents in multi-turn negotiations, as demonstrated by the EvoEmo framework's superior performance.

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaZero framework adaptation for changed test environments with simple modifications to boost performance under low planning budget


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero assumes static environments from training to test, limiting real-world applicability where environments may change

Method: Simple modifications to standard AlphaZero framework to handle environment changes at test time

Result: Significant performance improvement even with low planning budget available

Conclusion: Proposed modifications enable effective AlphaZero deployment in dynamic environments with practical planning constraints

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge psychological theory with LLM behavior design by creating psychologically grounded AI agents that exhibit consistent, interpretable personality-driven behaviors across diverse tasks.

Method: Priming LLM agents with distinct MBTI personality archetypes via prompt engineering, using the official 16Personalities test for automated verification of trait persistence, and experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols.

Result: Personality priming yields consistent behavioral biases: emotionally expressive agents excel in narrative generation, analytically primed agents adopt stable strategies in game theory, and self-reflection improves cooperation and reasoning quality. The approach generalizes to other psychological frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents without fine-tuning, successfully demonstrating that psychological personality conditioning can effectively control and improve LLM agent behavior across various applications.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes concept-level memory for LLMs that distills reusable abstractions from reasoning traces, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates and achieving 7.5% performance gain on ARC-AGI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs discard valuable patterns and insights from reasoning traces once context windows reset. External memory could persist these discoveries but existing approaches use instance-based entries that lack reusability and scalability.

Method: Introduces concept-level memory with strategies for abstracting takeaways from solution rollouts and retrieving relevant concepts for new queries. Uses natural language storage of modular abstractions that can be selectively integrated into prompts.

Result: 7.5% relative gain over strong no-memory baseline on ARC-AGI benchmark, with performance scaling with inference compute. Abstract concepts outperformed other memory designs at all compute scales. Dynamic memory updating during test-time beat fixed memory settings.

Conclusion: Concept-level memory enables effective test-time continual learning through reusable abstractions, supporting self-improvement as solving more problems generates more patterns for memory, leading to further solutions.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Motivation: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer's and related dementias remain undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach that needs effective AI adaptation strategies.

Method: Evaluated nine text-only and three multimodal audio-text models on DementiaBank speech corpus using various adaptations: in-context learning with demonstration selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration.

Result: Class-centroid demonstrations achieved highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, token-level fine-tuning produced best scores.

*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

TL;DR: RBA framework enhances speech-based LLMs' instruction-following using self-synthesized data and reinforcement learning, outperforming conventional methods and achieving SOTA on speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech-based LLMs (SpeechLMs) show performance gaps compared to text-based LLMs due to inter-modal discrepancies, especially with dynamic user speech inputs.

Method: Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA) uses self-synthesis methodology with a teacher LLM to generate alignment data, then employs reinforcement learning to align SpeechLMs with teacher behavior.

Result: RBA effectively enhances instruction-following capabilities, outperforms conventional distillation baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on spoken QA and speech-to-text translation benchmarks.

Conclusion: RBA provides a powerful framework for improving SpeechLMs without human annotations, demonstrating strong generalization across speech-related tasks using only self-generated data.

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cryptocurrency news analysis challenges, particularly large language model hallucinations, and provide complementary graph/text views for comprehensive insights.

Method: Uses fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM with 4-bit quantization via PEFT/LoRA approach and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Performs hierarchical stacking of graph and text summaries across multiple levels.

Result: The approach successfully generates informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights while eliminating hallucination problems through knowledge graph representations.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B models with RAG are effective for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis, offering complementary graph/text views and reliable insights without hallucinations.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC is a comprehensive event log of Italian lawmaking process (1987-2022) created using LLMs from unstructured data, serving as a benchmark for legal process mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process mining's application in legal systems is limited by dataset accessibility and quality issues, requiring better data resources for legal domain analysis.

Method: Created ProLiFIC dataset from unstructured Normattiva portal data using large language models (LLMs) to structure the Italian lawmaking process information.

Result: Developed a comprehensive event log spanning 35 years of Italian legislative procedures, enabling preliminary process mining analyses in the legal domain.

Conclusion: ProLiFIC serves as a valuable benchmark for legal process mining, facilitating new developments and integration of PM with LLMs in legal systems analysis.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel multi-modal framework for earnings calls using hierarchical discourse trees with text, audio, and video signals for semantic-rich embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis systems fail to capture the layered discourse structure of earnings calls, which blend scripted and unscripted content across multiple modalities.

Method: Two-stage transformer architecture: first encodes multi-modal content and discourse metadata at node level using contrastive learning, second synthesizes global embedding for entire conference with hierarchical discourse trees.

Result: Embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful representations reflecting affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment, generalizing to other domains like tele-medicine and political discourse.

Conclusion: Framework provides robust and explainable approach for multi-modal discourse representation with practical utility for financial forecasting and generalizable to high-stakes communication domains.

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Early-SIB: Transformer model predicts adolescent suicidal ideation from forum posts before explicit disclosure, achieving 0.73 balanced accuracy on Dutch youth forum data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, but many cases go undetected due to lack of mental health contact. Social media provides real-time insights into youth struggles.

Method: Transformer-based model that sequentially processes user posts and engagement content to predict future suicidal ideation/behavior posts without using self-disclosure as input.

Result: Achieved 0.73 balanced accuracy for predicting future SIB posts on a Dutch youth forum dataset.

Conclusion: Social media-based predictive tools can meaningfully supplement traditional suicide prevention methods by detecting risk before explicit disclosure.

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable method for real-time detection of entity-level hallucinations in long-form LLM generations using web-search-annotated data and linear probes, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language models can cause serious harm in high-stakes applications like medical or legal contexts, but existing detection methods are impractical for real-world use due to limitations with long-form content or high verification costs.

Method: Developed an annotation methodology using web search to label model responses with grounded entity-level hallucinations, then trained efficient linear probe classifiers on this dataset to detect fabricated tokens in real-time.

Result: Classifiers consistently outperform baselines including semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B) on long-form responses and also improve short-form QA performance. They generalize beyond entities to detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising scalable solution for real-world hallucination detection, with publicly released datasets enabling effective classifier training across different models despite the expensive annotation process.

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [117] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces UDIB, a principled topic identification method based on Deterministic Information Bottleneck that improves detection of LLM confabulations by creating maximally informative shared topic representations between prompts and responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Semantic Divergence Metrics for detecting LLM confabulations rely on geometric clustering optimized for spatial proximity rather than information-theoretic analysis, creating a disconnect between topic identification and downstream faithfulness evaluation.

Method: The authors transform the Deterministic Information Bottleneck method into a practical algorithm by substituting the intractable KL divergence with a computationally efficient upper bound, creating UDIB - an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means that favors parsimonious informative clusters.

Result: UDIB generates shared topic representations from LLM prompt and response embeddings that are not just spatially coherent but fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the prompt-response relationship.

Conclusion: UDIB provides a superior foundation for Semantic Divergence Metrics framework and offers a more sensitive tool for detecting LLM confabulations by bridging the gap between topic optimization and information-theoretic analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of practice materials tailored to abundant educational resources available to learners in the information-rich era

Method: Four-component system: multi-modal input handling, question generation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and end-to-end interactive interface

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR^2 framework uses adversarial reinforcement learning to train LLMs in abstraction by having a teacher model create complex narrative problems from kernel problems, while a student model learns to extract the underlying computational logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training for code generation focuses on superficial pattern recognition rather than explicit abstraction skills, which are critical for solving complex programming problems and improving generalization.

Method: AR^2 employs a teacher model that transforms kernel problems into narrative-rich descriptions while preserving fundamental logic, and a student coding model trained to solve these complex problems by extracting their underlying computational kernels.

Result: Experimental results show that AR^2 substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen, challenging programming tasks.

Conclusion: Abstraction is a key skill for enhancing LLM generalization, and the AR^2 framework successfully demonstrates how explicit training for abstraction can significantly improve performance on complex programming tasks.

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs during LLM inference to improve factual accuracy by integrating internal LLM knowledge and external retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with factual consistency due to parametric memory limitations, and existing RAG methods treat knowledge as unstructured text, limiting compositional reasoning and factual inconsistency detection.

Method: Extracts seed KG from questions via prompting, iteratively expands using LLM's latent knowledge, then selectively refines through external retrieval to enhance factual coverage and correct inaccuracies.

Result: Consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods across three factual QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse successfully addresses multi-document scientific inference challenges and provides a citation-aware benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct

integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,

TL;DR: Traditional OCR systems like Sprinklr-Edge-OCR outperform large vision-language models in edge deployment due to superior efficiency, lower cost, and better F1 scores despite LVLMs having higher precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of multilingual OCR in noisy real-world images and evaluate whether large vision-language models can outperform traditional OCR systems in resource-constrained edge environments.

Method: Comparative evaluation of 5 state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and 2 traditional OCR systems on a proprietary multilingual dataset with 54 languages, measuring accuracy, semantic consistency, language coverage, computational efficiency, and deployment costs.

Result: Qwen achieved highest precision (0.54) but Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered best overall F1 score (0.46), processing images 35x faster (0.17s/image) at less than 0.01x the cost ($0.006/1000 images) compared to LVLMs.

Conclusion: Traditional OCR systems are more optimal for edge deployment than LVLMs due to significantly lower compute requirements, lower latency, and much higher affordability, even in the era of large language models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

TL;DR: Lightweight steering vectors can reduce LLM self-preference bias by up to 97% without retraining, but show instability on legitimate self-preference cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from self-preference bias where they favor their own outputs over others, undermining fairness in evaluation pipelines for tasks like preference tuning and model routing.

Method: Introduce curated dataset distinguishing justified vs unjustified self-preference, and construct steering vectors using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and optimization-based approach to mitigate bias at inference time.

Result: Steering vectors reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97%, substantially outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines.

Conclusion: While promising for reducing bias, steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement, indicating self-preference spans multiple nonlinear directions, motivating more robust interventions for LLM-as-judges safeguards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

TL;DR: Analysis of SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and semantic embeddings in clinical notes reveals weak correlation but complementary value for improving documentation completeness and uncovering clinical relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain rich narratives but unstructured format challenges large-scale analysis. Understanding how SNOMED CT concepts relate through co-occurrence and semantic similarity is underexplored despite standardized terminologies improving interoperability.

Method: Leveraged MIMIC-IV database to investigate relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic similarity using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained embeddings (ClinicalBERT, BioBERT). Examined temporal evolution and cross-specialty patterns.

Result: Co-occurrence and semantic similarity are weakly correlated but embeddings capture clinically meaningful associations not reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented. Clustering revealed coherent clinical themes mapping to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes like mortality and readmission.

Conclusion: Findings highlight complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings for improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Motivation: To address the challenge of stance detection across different domains and targets by leveraging semantic similarities between stance targets for better domain adaptation.

Method: Utilizes metric learning with triplet loss to construct a discriminative embedding space that captures semantic similarities and differences between stance targets.

Result: Shows statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across six widely used models in multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: MLSD effectively enhances domain adaptation for stance detection by learning useful representations from new target domains through metric learning.

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative

model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across

### [127] [SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03791)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SiLVERScore is a new embedding-based metric for sign language generation evaluation that directly assesses semantic similarity in joint embedding space, overcoming limitations of back-translation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sign language evaluation through back-translation introduces ambiguity and fails to capture multimodal aspects like facial expressions and spatial grammar, making it hard to identify whether errors come from generation or translation systems.

Method: Proposed SiLVERScore, a semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space, focusing on semantic similarity rather than back-translation.

Result: On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC = 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

Conclusion: SiLVERScore provides a robust, semantically-aware evaluation approach for sign language generation that addresses the limitations of existing back-translation methods and effectively captures semantic and prosodic variations.

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

### [128] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs claim reasoning but current benchmarks don't test interactive grounding. New 4-metric suite evaluates VLMs in interactive referential games, showing models diverge from human patterns despite task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks evaluate VLMs in single-turn or QA settings, but grounding is an interactive process where people develop shared understanding through ongoing communication.

Method: Introduced a four-metric suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, human-likeness) and deployed it on 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs, comparing with human dyads.

Result: All three models diverged from human patterns on at least three metrics (GPT4o-mini was closest overall). Task success scores don't indicate successful grounding, and high image-utterance alignment doesn't necessarily predict task success.

Conclusion: The metric suite and findings provide a framework for future research on VLM grounding, highlighting the need for better evaluation of interactive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

*Jiaxin Guo,Daimeng Wei,Yuanchang Luo,Xiaoyu Chen,Zhanglin Wu,Huan Yang,Hengchao Shang,Zongyao Li,Zhiqiang Rao,Jinlong Yang,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Align-then-Slide framework for evaluating document-level machine translation by aligning source-target sentences and using multi-chunk sliding evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods assume sentence-by-sentence alignment, but LLMs produce whole-document outputs that challenge this assumption, requiring new evaluation approaches for document-level machine translation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Align stage - automatically infer sentence-level correspondences and rebuild target to match source sentence structure; 2) n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage - calculate averaged metric scores under 1-4 chunks for multi-granular assessment.

Result: Achieves Pearson correlation of 0.929 with expert MQM rankings on WMT benchmark, aligns closely with human judgments on real-world test set, and enables effective CPO training and GRPO reward modeling that outperform vanilla SFT baseline.

Conclusion: The framework provides an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool for document-level machine translation systems, effectively addressing the challenges posed by LLM-generated whole-document outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

### [130] [NE-PADD: Leveraging Named Entity Knowledge for Robust Partial Audio Deepfake Detection via Attention Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03829)
*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NE-PADD is a novel method for partial audio deepfake detection that leverages named entity recognition to improve frame-level fake speech localization, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audio deepfake detection works at sentence level, but partial detection requires frame-level localization. Semantic information from audio, particularly named entities, remains underexplored for this task.

Method: Proposes NE-PADD with two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and PADD. Uses attention fusion and attention transfer mechanisms to combine attention weights and guide PADD with named entity semantics using auxiliary loss.

Result: Experiments on PartialSpoof-NER dataset show the method outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge.

Conclusion: Leveraging named entity knowledge through parallel branches and attention mechanisms significantly improves partial audio deepfake detection performance.

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

### [131] [Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03867)
*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to understand "Drivelology" - syntactically coherent but pragmatically paradoxical language that requires contextual inference and emotional interpretation, despite excelling at standard NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLMs' limitations in understanding layered semantic meaning and pragmatic depth in language, challenging the assumption that statistical fluency equals cognitive comprehension.

Method: Created a diverse benchmark dataset of 1,200+ curated Drivelology examples across multiple languages, with expert annotation and adjudication. Evaluated various LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks.

Result: LLMs consistently failed to grasp Drivelological text, confusing it with shallow nonsense, producing incoherent justifications, and missing implied rhetorical functions, revealing a representational gap in pragmatic understanding.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in processing language with deep pragmatic meaning, highlighting the need for improved models that can handle linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing how Chain-of-Thought reasoning affects LLM trustworthiness across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy, finding that while CoT improves some aspects, it introduces new vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in Chain-of-Thought reasoning improving LLM performance, there's limited understanding of how CoT techniques impact model trustworthiness across key dimensions.

Method: Comprehensive survey of recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, analyzing studies chronologically across five trustworthiness dimensions with detailed methodology and limitation analysis.

Result: CoT reasoning shows promise for enhancing trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation and robustness improvement, but cutting-edge reasoning models often suffer from comparable or greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a valuable resource for AI safety community, highlighting that while reasoning techniques can improve trustworthiness, they also introduce new vulnerabilities that require further research attention.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

### [133] [False Sense of Security: Why Probing-based Malicious Input Detection Fails to Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03888)
*Cheng Wang,Zeming Wei,Qin Liu,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probing-based safety detection methods in LLMs learn superficial patterns like instructional formats and trigger words rather than semantic harmfulness, creating a false sense of security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically re-examine probing-based approaches for detecting harmful instructions in LLMs, motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance and concerns that probes learn superficial patterns instead of semantic harmfulness.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments including: comparing performance with simple n-gram methods, using semantically cleaned datasets, and detailed analysis of pattern dependencies to identify what probes actually learn.

Result: Confirmed that probes learn superficial patterns (instructional patterns and trigger words) rather than semantic harmfulness, demonstrating comparable performance to simple n-gram methods and revealing limitations in current probing approaches.

Conclusion: Current probing-based approaches create a false sense of security; there is a need to redesign both models and evaluation protocols for responsible safety detection research in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

### [134] [MobileRAG: Enhancing Mobile Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03891)
*Gowen Loo,Chang Liu,Qinghong Yin,Xiang Chen,Jiawei Chen,Jingyuan Zhang,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MobileRAG is a mobile agent framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that addresses limitations in current LLM-based mobile agents, achieving 10.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile agents rely heavily on LLM comprehension, lack environmental interaction, and have no memory capabilities, leading to errors and task termination when apps cannot fulfill queries.

Method: Proposes MobileRAG framework with three components: InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG, leveraging RAG technology to quickly identify user queries and accomplish complex mobile tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on the new MobileRAG-Eval benchmark show the framework handles real-world mobile tasks effectively, achieving 10.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer steps.

Conclusion: MobileRAG successfully addresses key limitations of current mobile agents through RAG enhancement, providing a more robust solution for complex mobile task automation with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Matrix of Thought (MoT) is a novel LLM reasoning structure that enables multi-dimensional thinking through column-cell communication, reducing redundancy and enhancing complex QA performance with improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought suffer from issues like in-layer redundancy and single-path reasoning, while RAG methods struggle with effectively utilizing large amounts of multi-entity, multi-hop information in complex QA tasks.

Method: Proposes Matrix of Thought (MoT) with column-cell communication mechanism for horizontal and vertical problem exploration, plus fact-correction mechanism using knowledge units from retrieved KG triples and raw text to enhance reasoning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets in F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4% of baseline methods, demonstrating both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: MoT provides an efficient and accurate framework for complex QA by enabling multi-strategy deep-level thinking and knowledge enhancement, significantly improving LLM reasoning capabilities while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

*Iro Lim,Haein Ji,Byungjun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KPoEM is a novel Korean poetry emotion dataset with 7,662 entries annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories, enabling state-of-the-art emotion classification in Korean poetry through specialized fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Korean poetry remains underexplored in computational emotion analysis due to its figurative language and cultural specificity, despite advances in general text emotion classification.

Method: Built a multi-label emotion dataset of 7,662 entries (line-level and work-level) from 483 poems by five Korean poets, annotated with 44 emotion categories. Used sequential fine-tuning of Korean language models - first on general corpora then on KPoEM dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned model significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60 F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The model demonstrated enhanced ability to identify culturally specific emotional expressions while preserving core sentiments.

Conclusion: This study bridges computational methods and literary analysis, enabling quantitative exploration of poetic emotions while retaining emotional and cultural nuances of Korean literature through structured data.

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SelfAug is a self-distribution alignment method that mitigates catastrophic forgetting in LLM fine-tuning by aligning input sequence logits to preserve the model's original semantic distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning in RAG scenarios often causes catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Existing solutions either require general instruction data or fail to preserve the model's original distribution.

Method: Proposes SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to maintain the model's semantic distribution during fine-tuning, preventing distribution shifts that cause catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments show SelfAug achieves superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Analysis reveals direct correlation between distribution shifts and catastrophic forgetting severity in RAG scenarios.

Conclusion: SelfAug provides an effective solution to catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning scenarios, advancing understanding of distribution shifts in RAG contexts and offering practical applicability across diverse fine-tuning settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL improves self-play fine-tuning for Text-to-SQL by adding verification-based iterative fine-tuning and error-driven loss to handle opponent model errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN faces challenges in Text-to-SQL because it doesn't generate new information and correct SQL from opponent models reduces main model's accuracy.

Method: Proposes SPFT-SQL with verification-based iterative fine-tuning before self-play to create high-quality data, and error-driven loss during self-play to learn from opponent's mistakes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six LLMs and five benchmarks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL effectively addresses SPIN's limitations in Text-to-SQL by incorporating verification and error-driven learning, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoxRole is the first comprehensive benchmark for speech-based role-playing conversational agents, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation and paralinguistic feature consideration in current RPCA research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RPCA research focuses only on text modality and overlooks critical paralinguistic features like intonation and prosody. There's also a lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for speech-based role-playing, with existing datasets failing to quantify core competencies like long-term persona consistency.

Method: The authors introduce VoxRole benchmark comprising 13,335 multi-turn dialogues (65.6 hours of speech) from 1,228 characters across 261 movies. They developed a novel two-stage automated pipeline: first aligning movie audio with scripts, then using an LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional character profiles.

Result: The benchmark enables multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Conclusion: VoxRole addresses critical gaps in speech-based RPCA evaluation by providing the first comprehensive benchmark that incorporates paralinguistic features and enables standardized assessment of persona consistency in spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

TL;DR: CANDY benchmark evaluates LLMs for Chinese misinformation fact-checking, finding current models unreliable alone but potentially useful as assistive tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess LLMs' capabilities and limitations in fact-checking Chinese misinformation, as their effectiveness remains uncertain despite growing use.

Method: Created CANDY benchmark with ~20k annotated instances, tested LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting, developed taxonomy to categorize flawed explanations.

Result: Current LLMs show limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, with factual fabrication being the most common failure mode.

Conclusion: LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking but have considerable potential to augment human performance when used as assistive tools.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

*Ulin Nuha,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper creates synthetic datasets for Ladin (an endangered Romance language) by translating Italian data, improving machine translation performance for this low-resource language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models perform poorly on extremely low-resource languages like indigenous languages due to lack of labeled data. Ladin, an endangered Romance language, lacks high-quality NLP datasets.

Method: Used parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs to create synthetic datasets for sentiment analysis and MCQA by translating monolingual Italian data. Applied rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures to ensure quality.

Result: Incorporating synthetic datasets into machine translation training led to substantial improvements over existing Italian-Ladin translation baselines.

Conclusion: Created the first publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing foundational resources for broader NLP research and applications for this underrepresented language.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

*Zhaoyan Gong,Juan Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA is a novel framework for temporal knowledge graph question answering that uses recursive decomposition and multi-path aggregation to handle complex temporal queries without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TKGQA methods struggle with complex temporal queries, limited reasoning abilities, and error propagation in decomposition frameworks, lacking capability for explicit temporal constraints.

Method: RTQA recursively decomposes questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation for fault tolerance through three core components: Temporal Question Decomposer, Recursive Solver, and Answer Aggregator.

Result: Experiments on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks show significant Hits@1 improvements in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RTQA effectively addresses limitations of current TKGQA methods by enhancing reasoning capabilities without training requirements, demonstrating superior performance on complex temporal queries through recursive decomposition and multi-path aggregation.

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [144] [On Robustness and Reliability of Benchmark-Based Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04013)
*Riccardo Lunardi,Vincenzo Della Mea,Stefano Mizzaro,Kevin Roitero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant performance drops when benchmark questions are paraphrased, challenging the reliability of standard evaluations and highlighting robustness issues with linguistic variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether standard benchmark evaluations accurately reflect LLM capabilities in real-world scenarios where questions appear in diverse linguistic forms rather than fixed standardized formats.

Method: Systematically generated various paraphrases of all questions across six common benchmarks and measured effectiveness variations across 34 state-of-the-art LLMs of different sizes and capabilities.

Result: While LLM rankings remained relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores significantly declined, indicating models struggle with linguistic variability.

Conclusion: Benchmark-based evaluations may not fully capture model robustness, necessitating the development of robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect real-world deployment scenarios with linguistic variations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models show increasing cross-lingual consistency as they grow larger and more capable, with self-consistency across languages exceeding agreement with other models in the same language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how similar model outputs are across different languages and whether model size and capability affect cross-lingual consistency.

Method: Used the κₚ similarity metric to analyze 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU, comparing model responses across languages and between different models.

Result: Larger and more capable models demonstrate greater consistency in outputs across languages. Models show higher self-consistency across languages than agreement with other models prompted in the same language.

Conclusion: κₚ is a valuable tool for evaluating multilingual reliability and can guide development of more consistent multilingual systems, with model size being a key factor in cross-lingual consistency.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First automatic Chinese functional syntax annotation system using RoBERTa, achieving 0.852 F1 score on core syntactic elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of automated annotation system for Chinese texts based on Systemic Functional Grammar/Cardiff Grammar theory, limiting application and promotion of these linguistic theories.

Method: Fine-tuned RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model on 4,100 annotated sentences from People's Daily 2014 corpus for named entity recognition of functional syntax elements.

Result: Achieved 0.852 F1 score on test set, outperforming other models. Excellent performance on core elements (Subject, Main Verb, Complement) but needs improvement on imbalanced label samples.

Conclusion: First successful integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, providing new automated analysis method and foundation for future Chinese linguistic research.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes synthetic sheet music problems for evaluating and training AI models on music theory reasoning, showing improved performance in music understanding and composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning in LLMs and MLLMs to advance AI musicianship.

Method: Develops a data synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in textual and visual modalities, creating SSMR-Bench and using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 on MusicTheoryBench and achieves comparable reasoning to GPT-4. Models show improved sheet music interpretation and enhanced math problem performance.

Conclusion: First to synthesize sheet music problems based on music theory rules, demonstrating effectiveness in advancing model reasoning for music understanding and enabling AI-assisted music creation.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Result: Found that despite the success of chatbots in other languages, only a few educational Arabic chatbots utilize modern techniques like BERT and GPT. Identified significant research gaps in this domain.

Conclusion: There is substantial untapped potential for Arabic educational chatbots using modern AI approaches. The study provides future research directions to advance this field and bridge the gap with other language implementations.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a system for detecting and explaining covert narratives in news articles using fine-tuned BERT for multi-label classification and GPT-4o with ReACT framework for evidence-based explanations, enhanced with auxiliary knowledge to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting subtle phrasing and hidden agendas in news content, making it difficult to analyze bias and sentiment through covert narratives and implicit messaging.

Method: Fine-tune BERT model with recall-oriented approach for narrative detection, then use GPT-4o pipeline with ReACT framework (Reasoning + Acting) and semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting for explanations, incorporating structured taxonomy table as auxiliary knowledge base.

Result: Integration of auxiliary knowledge in prompts improves both classification accuracy and justification reliability, demonstrating effective narrative detection and explanation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses multi-label narrative classification and evidence-based explanation generation, with applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how to build stable, personalized lexical profiles from minimal speech data (10 minutes) to enable lexical alignment in conversational agents, finding optimal profiles with 5 adjectives/conjunctions and 10 adverbs/nouns/pronouns/verbs each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lexical alignment improves human communication but remains underexplored in conversational agents despite recent LLM advancements. The research aims to enable lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue by creating personalized lexical profiles.

Method: Varied amounts of transcribed spoken data and number of items per POS category to construct lexical profiles. Evaluated profile performance over time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics.

Result: Smaller, more compact profiles created from 10 minutes of transcribed speech (5 items for adjectives/conjunctions, 10 items for adverbs/nouns/pronouns/verbs) offered the best balance of performance and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for constructing stable lexical profiles with minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step toward implementing lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Joint modeling of entity features and discourse relations significantly improves coherence assessment performance compared to using either feature type alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing coherence modeling work focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse relations, with little attention to combining both approaches for comprehensive coherence assessment.

Method: Explored two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations for coherence assessment, integrating both types of features in the models.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that integrating both entity and discourse relation features significantly enhances coherence model performance.

Conclusion: Modeling both entity features and discourse relations simultaneously provides substantial benefits for coherence evaluation, highlighting the importance of combining these complementary approaches.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT is a multi-agent framework that generates high-quality synthetic psychological counseling sessions by decomposing counselor responses into specialized sub-tasks, outperforming single-agent methods and improving counseling skills by 3.2-7.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing need for scalable psychological counseling but limited access to high-quality, privacy-compliant data for fine-tuning LLMs, creating a scarcity of suitable training data.

Method: Multi-agent framework with specialized LLM agents that each model different psychological techniques, decomposing counselor response generation into coordinated sub-tasks. Also introduces unified evaluation with 9 expert assessment aspects.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment. Improves general counseling skills by 3.2% and CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on CTRS. Experts prefer MAGneT sessions in 77.2% of cases. Fine-tuning with MAGneT data shows 6.3-7.3% improvements.

Conclusion: MAGneT effectively addresses data scarcity for psychological counseling LLMs through multi-agent synthetic generation, providing higher quality training data that leads to better counseling performance when used for fine-tuning.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug is a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework that combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to improve social event detection without requiring additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social event detection relies on labeled data which is costly and labor-intensive to annotate, creating a need for data augmentation methods to enhance model performance without additional annotation.

Method: Combines explicit text augmentation using large language models with five generation strategies, and implicit feature-space augmentation with five novel perturbation techniques on structural fused embeddings that preserve semantic and relational properties.

Result: Outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on Twitter2012 and 15.57% on Twitter2018 datasets in terms of average F1 score.

Conclusion: SED-Aug effectively enhances data diversity and model robustness through dual augmentation, significantly improving social event detection performance without requiring additional labeled data.

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: Inverse IFEval benchmark measures LLMs' counter-intuitive ability to override training biases and follow adversarial instructions, revealing cognitive inertia issues in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with cognitive inertia - they fail to follow instructions that conflict with standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning, limiting their real-world adaptability.

Method: Proposed Inverse IFEval benchmark with 8 challenge types (Question Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, etc.), created 1012 high-quality Chinese/English questions across 23 domains using human-in-the-loop pipeline, evaluated using optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework.

Result: Experiments on leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of the benchmark, showing models' limitations in counter-intuitive instruction following.

Conclusion: Future alignment should focus not just on fluency and factual correctness but also adaptability in unconventional contexts. Inverse IFEval serves as diagnostic tool and foundation for methods to mitigate cognitive inertia and enhance LLM reliability in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

### [156] [Facts Fade Fast: Evaluating Memorization of Outdated Medical Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04304)
*Juraj Vladika,Mahdi Dhaini,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in healthcare risk providing outdated medical advice due to static training data. Researchers created MedRevQA and MedChangeQA datasets to evaluate this problem, finding all tested LLMs rely on obsolete knowledge, and propose mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of LLMs providing harmful outdated medical advice as medical knowledge evolves, since static training data cannot keep up with changing medical consensus and new research developments.

Method: Created two novel QA datasets: MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs for general biomedical knowledge) and MedChangeQA (512 QA pairs tracking medical consensus changes over time). Evaluated eight prominent LLMs on these datasets to analyze their reliance on outdated knowledge.

Result: All eight tested LLMs showed consistent reliance on outdated medical knowledge across both datasets. Researchers also analyzed the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to explain this phenomenon.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant risks in using current LLMs for medical applications due to outdated knowledge, and proposes future directions for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems that can adapt to evolving medical consensus.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO improves contextual ASR by integrating phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical filtering to better handle domain-specific named entities and homophones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with domain-specific named entities and homophones. Contextual ASR often fails due to limited entity diversity and treats entities as independent tokens, leading to incomplete multi-token biasing.

Method: Propose PARCO with four components: phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering to enhance phonetic discrimination and ensure complete entity retrieval.

Result: Achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. Shows robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: PARCO effectively addresses phonetic variation challenges in contextual ASR through integrated phoneme-aware and contrastive learning approaches, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets and languages.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

### [158] [Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04373)
*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM gender bias evaluations are highly sensitive to prompt design, with minor changes significantly altering bias measurements and sometimes reversing outcomes, raising concerns about ecological validity of benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in socially impactful settings, there's growing concern about gender bias. Current evaluation methods often use artificial prompts that signal the presence of bias-related content, which may not reflect real-world usage.

Method: Tested models under different prompt conditions that make testing context and gender-focused content salient. Assessed prompt sensitivity across four task formats using both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics.

Result: Minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias outcomes, sometimes reversing direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics tend to amplify bias compared to probabilistic measures.

Conclusion: Findings reveal brittleness in LLM gender bias evaluations and raise questions about whether controlled testing triggers 'testing mode' performance, challenging the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

*Mutsumi Sasaki,Go Kamoda,Ryosuke Takahashi,Kosuke Sato,Kentaro Inui,Keisuke Sakaguchi,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of language models' ability to handle Japanese calendar tasks, revealing that even Japanese-centric models struggle with calendar arithmetic and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work on temporal reasoning in LMs has focused only on Gregorian calendar, ignoring culturally significant non-Gregorian systems like Japanese calendar that are actively used.

Method: Created datasets for four tasks requiring temporal knowledge and reasoning, evaluated range of English-centric and Japanese-centric language models on Japanese calendar handling.

Result: Some models can perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with Japanese-calendar arithmetic and maintaining consistency across calendars.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of developing language models with better culture-specific calendar understanding beyond just Gregorian systems.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

### [160] [The Optimiser Hidden in Plain Sight: Training with the Loss Landscape's Induced Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03594)
*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel Riemannian geometry-based optimizers that use loss landscape embedding metrics, showing effectiveness in low dimensions and slight improvements over state-of-the-art methods with desirable theoretical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the Riemannian metric naturally induced when embedding loss landscapes in higher-dimensional space, which underlies common visualizations of loss landscapes, to develop more effective optimization methods.

Method: Developed a new class of optimizers using the induced Riemannian metric from loss landscape embeddings, compared against SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon across various tasks and architectures.

Result: Highly effective in low-dimensional examples, provides slight improvement over state-of-the-art methods, with computational complexity comparable to Adam. Automatically decreases learning rate in high-curvature regions and enables effective scheduled learning rates.

Conclusion: The Riemannian geometry-based approach offers theoretically desirable properties and practical improvements, serving as a smoothed form of gradient clipping while naturally incorporating decoupled weight decay from geometric perspective.

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT is a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that unifies feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation in a single architecture with time-token-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI models for EHRs are designed for narrow single-purpose tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Developed CEHR-GPT with a novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients' dynamic timelines into the model structure, supporting temporal reasoning over clinical sequences.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks (feature representation, zero-shot prediction, synthetic data generation) and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT's versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without task-specific retraining, making it suitable for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

*E. Khalafyan,A. E. Allahverdyan,A. Hovhannisyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF and PCC are shown to be closely related, with PCC providing robust rank estimation for NMF that resolves nonidentifiability, while NMF enables approximate PCC implementation for clustering and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reciprocal relationship between Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Principle of Common Cause (PCC) in probabilistic causality, and leverage this connection for improved data analysis.

Method: Mapping gray-scale images into probability models, using PCC for robust rank estimation in NMF, and implementing NMF-based clustering and denoising methods that approximate PCC principles.

Result: PCC provides stable rank estimation for NMF that is robust against noise, resolves NMF nonidentifiability, and produces stable basis images. NMF enables effective PCC implementation for clustering data points by common causes and data denoising.

Conclusion: The reciprocal relationship between NMF and PCC offers mutual benefits: PCC enhances NMF robustness and identifiability, while NMF provides practical implementation of PCC for clustering and denoising applications.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

### [163] [Semi-decentralized Federated Time Series Prediction with Client Availability Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03660)
*Yunkai Bao,Reza Safarzadeh,Xin Wang,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDeCAB is a semi-decentralized client selection method for federated learning that handles time-series data availability issues by using probabilistic rankings and neighbor-assisted partial parameter sharing when clients go offline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning in IoT scenarios faces challenges with data heterogeneity, limited energy budgets, and client availability issues. Client selection is crucial for global model convergence and balancing contributions, especially with time-series data where availability patterns affect performance.

Method: Proposed FedDeCAB method uses probabilistic rankings for client selection and allows disconnected clients to obtain partial model parameters from nearest neighbors for joint optimization, reducing communication overhead while improving offline model performance.

Result: Experiments on real-world large-scale taxi and vessel trajectory datasets demonstrate FedDeCAB's effectiveness under highly heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic client offline/rejoining scenarios.

Conclusion: FedDeCAB provides an effective solution for federated learning with time-series data by addressing client availability challenges through semi-decentralized probabilistic selection and neighbor-assisted parameter optimization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharedRep-RLHF is a new framework that learns shared traits across groups instead of separate reward models, addressing limitations of MaxMin-RLHF which performs poorly when the minimum-reward group is a minority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLHF fails to capture diverse opinions across sub-populations and favors dominant groups. While MaxMin-RLHF addresses fairness by optimizing for the minimum-reward group, it performs poorly when that group is a minority.

Method: SharedRep-RLHF learns shared traits in annotations among various groups rather than learning separate group-specific reward models. It leverages these shared representations across groups.

Result: Experiments show SharedRep-RLHF outperforms MaxMin-RLHF with up to 20% gain in win rate across diverse natural language tasks.

Conclusion: Learning shared traits across groups is more effective than separate group-specific models, especially when dealing with minority groups, providing better fairness and performance in RLHF.

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Conclusion: The SCM-FSCM model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints, and supports high-quality supply chain development through data-driven optimization.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Motivation: Gradient dynamics are crucial for neural network stability and generalization, but there's a gap between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors that needs addressing.

Method: Proposed hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling with their natural evolution during training, preventing unintended amplification while preserving convergence guarantees.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN show maintained or improved test accuracy even under strong generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: Direct tracking of gradient dynamics is important for bridging theory-practice gaps, and the proposed method provides stable optimization with practical performance benefits for future research.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational bottleneck of exact graph node kernels which have O(N^3) time complexity, making Bayesian inference and optimization infeasible for large graphs.

Method: Application of graph random features (GRFs) as stochastic estimators of graph node kernels for scalable Gaussian processes on discrete input spaces.

Result: Achieves substantial wall-clock speedups and memory savings, enabling Bayesian optimization on graphs with over 1,000,000 nodes on a single computer chip while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: GRFs provide an efficient approach for scalable Bayesian inference on large graphs, reducing computational complexity from cubic to O(N^{3/2}) while preserving performance.

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently
introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian
processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions)
Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect
to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial
wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs

Motivation: The rise of multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs) like GPT-4 and the need to leverage geo-distributed data from wireless devices motivates federated foundation models that can handle heterogeneity in modalities and tasks across fog/edge networks.

Method: HF-FMs strategically align M3T FM components (modality encoders, prompts, MoEs, adapters, task heads) with hierarchical fog/edge infrastructure, enable optional D2D communications for horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training.

Result: The paper presents architectural design of HF-FMs highlighting unique capabilities, prototypes HF-FMs in wireless network setting, and releases open-source code to foster exploration in this field.

Conclusion: HF-FMs represent an unexplored paradigm that addresses critical heterogeneity challenges in federated multi-modal multi-task foundation models for fog/edge networks, with promising potential demonstrated through prototyping and open-source release.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into

modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR is a new SNE algorithm that uses discrete graph curvature to better preserve data geometry and prevent spurious cluster fragmentation in high-dimensional visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNE algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often fail to preserve the true geometry of noisy, high-dimensional data, spuriously separating connected components and missing clusters in well-clusterable data.

Method: Proposes EmbedOR algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature and uses a curvature-enhanced distance metric to emphasize underlying cluster structure during stochastic embedding.

Result: EmbedOR extends consistency results to broader datasets, prevents fragmentation of continuous high-density regions, and provides better geometry preservation than other SNE algorithms and UMAP.

Conclusion: EmbedOR offers improved visualization capabilities and geometry preservation, and its distance metric can be used to annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and gain deeper insights into data geometry.

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

### [172] [Online Learning of Optimal Sequential Testing Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03707)
*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online Testing Problem (OTP) with correlated, costly tests where missing data from partial testing increases minimax regret to Ω(T^{2/3}) vs Θ(√T) in standard MDPs. An Explore-Then-Commit algorithm achieves Õ(T^{2/3}) regret, while a variant with missingness-independent rewards enables Õ(√T) regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need optimal sequential testing policies for streams of subjects when tests are correlated and costly. Must make decisions with partial information when full testing is impractical, but missing data biases estimates and complicates learning.

Method: Formulate as MDP with unknown joint distribution of test outcomes. Prove Ω(T^{2/3}) minimax regret lower bound due to missing data. Develop Explore-Then-Commit algorithm for OTP and iterative-elimination algorithm for variant with missingness-independent rewards.

Result: Established fundamental difficulty: Ω(T^{2/3}) regret lower bound for OTP vs Θ(√T) in standard MDPs. Matched with Õ(T^{2/3}) algorithm. For missingness-independent reward variant, achieved Õ(√T) regret breaking the lower bound.

Conclusion: Missing data significantly increases exploration-exploitation difficulty in sequential testing. Reward structure matters - missingness-dependent rewards cause higher regret bounds. Guides efficient testing policy design under partial information.

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differentiable estimator for range-partition entropy enables deep learning algorithms to adapt to input sortedness, achieving significant speedups in geometry and improved accuracy with sparsity in Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Range-partition entropy provides strong theoretical guarantees in algorithm design but hasn't been accessible to deep learning. The goal is to make this concept differentiable for use in neural networks as trainable loss or regularizer.

Method: Proposed differentiable approximation of range-partition entropy, designed EntropyNet neural module to restructure data into low-entropy forms, and extended entropy regularization to Transformer attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieved up to 4.1× runtime speedups with <0.2% error in geometry tasks, and 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1 baselines in deep learning applications.

Conclusion: Entropy-bounded computation is both theoretically elegant and practically effective for adaptive learning, efficiency improvements, and structured representation in neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored representational properties of neural operators in scientific computing and test the Platonic Representation Hypothesis across different architectures.

Method: Extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, comparing inference and training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators.

Result: Lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators and demonstrates unique resolution-robust properties specific to neural operators.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First framework for optimizing spatial training data collection in satellite ML, addressing sparse/clustered data issues with cost-aware sampling strategies that show significant performance gains across multiple continents and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite ML applications are limited by sparse, clustered training data collected for other purposes, leaving practitioners uncertain about how to collect additional data effectively within budget constraints.

Method: Novel problem formulation for spatial training data optimization with heterogeneous collection costs and budget constraints, plus methods to address this optimization challenge.

Result: Experiments across three continents and four tasks show substantial performance gains from optimized sampling strategies, with delineation of settings where optimization is most effective.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes across SatML domains and provides practical guidance for augmenting clustered surveys, with immediate application to agricultural monitoring in Togo.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and accurate method for approximating real-valued functions on smooth manifolds that can handle high-dimensional data and incorporate new data efficiently.

Method: Builds on Diffusion Maps framework, uses diffusion geometry connected to heat equation and Laplace-Beltrami operator. Introduces SVD-based dimensionality reduction for distance matrices and online updating mechanism for new data incorporation.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method outperforms classical feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly in applications like sparse CT reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides an effective and scalable approach for function approximation on manifolds with superior performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and

TL;DR: A co-evolutionary framework where an Attacker agent learns a generative world model to create increasingly difficult challenges for Defender agents, enabling self-scaling curriculum and emergence of complex strategic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of hand-crafted training environments by developing world models that scale in complexity alongside learning agents, enabling truly generalizable and robust embodied intelligence.

Method: Proposes adversarial co-evolution: an Attacker agent learns goal-conditioned generative world model to synthesize challenging enemy configurations, while Defender team learns cooperative policies to overcome these generated scenarios.

Result: Framework leads to emergence of complex behaviors - world model generates flanking/shielding formations, defenders learn coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Creates effectively infinite stream of novel training scenarios.

Conclusion: Adversarial co-evolution is a powerful method for learning instrumental world models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness through self-scaling curriculum.

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient sparse-reward reinforcement learning, particularly through the lens of low-rank structure in reward matrices.

Method: Introduced Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) framework that connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement learning via policy-dependent sampling analysis. Includes impossibility results, reward-free representation learning, distribution-free confidence sets, and robust completion guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluation across 100 domains found exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong baselines, with only about 20% computational overhead.

Conclusion: Low-rank structure in reward matrices enables efficient sparse-reward RL with polynomial sample complexity. PAMC establishes structural reward learning as a promising paradigm with applications in robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical domains.

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for

*Xiannan Huang,Shuhan Qiu,Jiayuan Du,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAPT-Z is a novel online learning method for time series forecasting that addresses distribution shift by updating feature representations of latent factors rather than just parameters, and handles delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting using an adapter module with historical gradient information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting faces challenges from distribution shift, especially in online deployment where data arrives sequentially. Current methods focus on parameter selection and update strategies, but the authors argue that distribution shifts come from changes in underlying latent factors, so updating feature representations would be more effective.

Method: ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space) uses an adapter module that combines current feature representations with historical gradient information to enable robust parameter updates despite delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ADAPT-Z consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of updating feature representations of latent factors rather than just parameters is more effective for handling distribution shift in online time series forecasting, and ADAPT-Z successfully addresses the delayed feedback problem in multi-step forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: Machine learning framework using LiDAR data to classify indoor surfaces as semi-specular or low-specular for mmWave/sub-THz network connectivity optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz networks rely on surface reflections for reliable connectivity, but scattering behavior depends on surface roughness which affects whether signals remain specular or become diffuse.

Method: Collected 78,000+ LiDAR points from 15 indoor materials, partitioned into 3cm patches, extracted geometric and intensity features, and trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network classifiers.

Result: Ensemble tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) provided the best accuracy-robustness trade-off, confirming LiDAR features capture roughness-induced scattering effects.

Conclusion: The framework enables scatter-aware environment maps and digital twins for adaptive beam management and environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model for network partitioning, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and accuracy in community detection.

Method: Reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by decomposing global Hamiltonian into local utility functions. Prove convergence via better-response dynamics. Introduce two stability criteria: strict robustness and relaxed utility function with resolution parameter.

Result: Local optimization converges in pseudo-polynomial time to equilibrium. Robust partitions yield higher accuracy in community tracking scenarios when bootstrapping Leiden algorithm with partial ground-truth information.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic framework provides efficient, robust, and accurate community detection with proven convergence properties and practical benefits in real-world applications.

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of V2I communication link quality is essential for smooth handovers and reliable low-latency communication, but MLLMs lack 3D spatial understanding despite available sensor data.

Method: Proposes a plug-and-play BEV injection connector that constructs environmental BEV from neighboring vehicles' sensing data and fuses it with ego vehicle input. Uses CARLA and MATLAB co-simulation to generate multimodal data (RGB, LiDAR, GPS, wireless signals) across varied scenarios.

Result: The BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all three V2I tasks (LoS/NLoS classification, link availability, blockage prediction), with up to 13.9% macro-average accuracy improvement over ego-only baseline, and up to 32.7% gain in challenging rainy/nighttime conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed BEV injection framework effectively enhances MLLMs' spatial understanding for V2I link prediction, demonstrating robustness in adverse conditions and significant performance improvements across multiple prediction tasks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

TL;DR: Proposes a deep latent variable MFG model for inverse reinforcement learning that handles heterogeneous agent objectives without prior context knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods in mean field games assume agent homogeneity, limiting their ability to handle real-world scenarios with heterogeneous and unknown objectives from expert demonstrations.

Method: Developed a deep latent variable mean field game model and associated IRL method that can infer rewards from different but structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying contexts or model modifications.

Result: Experiments on simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art IRL methods in MFGs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the limitation of agent homogeneity in existing MFG IRL methods and provides a practical framework for inferring reward functions from expert demonstrations with heterogeneous objectives.

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

*Justin Kur,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel metric to automatically select optimal data augmentation strategies for quantization-aware knowledge distillation by maximizing contextual mutual information while maintaining prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT and KD methods focus on network output improvements but neglect the impact of input transformations like data augmentation, especially for low-precision models.

Method: Develops a metric that evaluates data augmentations based on their capacity to maximize contextual mutual information (non-label-related information) while ensuring predictions align with ground truth labels.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the method significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD performance across various models and datasets with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed automated DA selection method effectively enhances quantization-aware knowledge distillation and is compatible with any existing QAT or KD algorithm.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MillGNN is a graph neural network method that captures multi-scale lead-lag dependencies in multivariate time series forecasting, outperforming 16 state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS forecasting methods overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales, failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems.

Method: Uses scale-specific lead-lag graph learning with cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying features, plus hierarchical lead-lag message passing at multiple grouping scales.

Result: Demonstrates superiority for both long-term and short-term MTS forecasting across 11 datasets compared to 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MillGNN effectively captures comprehensive lead-lag effects with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MLP neural network model using urinary peptide biomarkers achieves high accuracy (95.67%) for non-invasive coronary heart disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary heart disease is a leading global cause of death with high healthcare costs, necessitating non-invasive diagnostic methods.

Method: Multilayer perceptron neural network trained on 50 urinary peptide biomarkers selected via genetic algorithms, with SMOTE balancing and stratified validation on 345 individuals per group.

Result: Achieved 95.67% precision, sensitivity, and specificity, with F1-score of 0.9565, AUC of 0.9748, MCC of 0.9134, and Cohen's kappa of 0.9131.

Conclusion: The model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease detection.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

*Zhiyu Wang,Arian Jamasb,Mustafa Hajij,Alex Morehead,Luke Braithwaite,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Topotein is a topological deep learning framework that uses hierarchical protein representations and SE(3)-equivariant message passing to outperform existing methods in protein representation learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein representation learning methods fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures, limiting their ability to understand structure-function relationships.

Method: Introduces Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) to represent proteins at multiple hierarchical levels and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet) with SE(3)-equivariant message passing across hierarchical structures.

Result: TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks across four protein representation learning tasks, particularly excelling in fold classification requiring secondary structure understanding.

Conclusion: Hierarchical topological features are crucial for effective protein analysis, and the topological deep learning approach provides superior performance in capturing multi-scale structural patterns.

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational efficiency limits in online learning by investigating the minimum arithmetic operations needed per round to learn arbitrary function families with finite mistakes.

Method: Proving general bounds on arithmetic operations per round required for mistake-bounded learning, addressing agnostic learning with bandit feedback problems from prior research.

Result: General bounds established for operation-capped mistake-bound learning, with solutions to specific problems from Filmus et al (2024) and Geneson & Tang (2024).

Conclusion: The work provides fundamental limits on computational efficiency in online learning and extends existing results to operation-constrained environments.

Abstract: We investigate the mistake-bound model of online learning with caps on the

an arbitrary family of functions with finitely many mistakes. We solve a

TL;DR: Formal verification of neural networks for satellite fault detection using Marabou tool to ensure robustness and reliability


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite component failures are costly and difficult to address, requiring early detection through embedded AI systems that must operate with extremely high reliability

Method: Employ formal verification tool Marabou to verify local robustness of neural network models, quantifying how much input can be perturbed before output behavior becomes unstable

Result: Improved trustworthiness of AI-based fault detection systems under uncertainty conditions

Conclusion: Formal verification through Marabou enables development of highly reliable AI systems for satellite fault detection by ensuring neural network robustness against input perturbations

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for aligning ML models with clinical knowledge through constraints, showing improved alignment without performance loss in prostate cancer prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in healthcare often fail to capture clinically meaningful patterns and relationships that align with medical expertise, leading to potential misalignment between model behavior and clinical experiential learning.

Method: Developed a reproducible framework incorporating clinical knowledge (collected via survey) as constraints into ML models, analyzed impact across underspecification degrees, and conducted randomized experiments with clinicians to test feedback-driven alignment.

Result: Constrained models successfully aligned with clinical knowledge without compromising performance. Larger differences between constrained/unconstrained models led to more apparent differences in clinical interpretation.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinical constraints into ML models is feasible and effective for aligning AI systems with medical expertise while maintaining predictive performance in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQuad addresses data heterogeneity in federated learning by optimizing intra-class and inter-class variance across clients to improve global model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with data heterogeneity, especially with limited dataset sizes and class imbalance, which negatively impacts global model performance during aggregation.

Method: FedQuad explicitly minimizes intra-class variance and maximizes inter-class variance across clients by reducing distance between similar pairs and increasing distance between negative pairs, effectively disentangling client data in feature space.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data distributions with many clients, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: Metric learning-based strategies like FedQuad are effective for addressing representational learning challenges in federated settings by improving feature disentanglement and model generalization.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

TL;DR: SP-CCI is a new conformal counterfactual inference method that uses synthetic data to reduce prediction interval width while maintaining coverage guarantees, addressing the conservativeness of existing CCI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal counterfactual inference methods provide marginal coverage but often produce overly conservative intervals, especially under treatment imbalance when counterfactual samples are scarce.

Method: SP-CCI augments the calibration set with synthetic counterfactual labels from a pre-trained counterfactual model, using risk-controlling prediction sets with a debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference to ensure validity.

Result: Empirical results show SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all settings while preserving marginal coverage.

Conclusion: SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate importance weighting, making it a more efficient approach for counterfactual inference.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses fairness concerns in algorithmic recourse systems, linking fairness guarantees between recourse and classification, and introduces a novel social burden-based fairness framework with practical algorithm MISOB that reduces social burden across groups without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging legislation mandates that classifiers must provide actionable recourse for negative decisions, but there are concerns about fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. The paper aims to address unfairness in algorithmic recourse.

Method: Provides theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic recourse, formally links fairness guarantees between recourse and classification, introduces a novel fairness framework based on social burden, and develops a practical algorithm called MISOB applicable under real-world conditions.

Result: Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The work provides a holistic theoretical foundation for understanding unfairness in algorithmic recourse and offers a practical solution that addresses fairness concerns while maintaining classifier performance.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine learning performance through data generation, specifically for classification tasks, using LLMs without the need for additional training.

Method: Uses agentic workflow with LLMs for automatic iterative data generation with feedback loops, incorporating external knowledge in the process.

Result: TAGAL performs on par with state-of-the-art approaches requiring LLM training and outperforms other training-free methods across diverse datasets and quality metrics.

Conclusion: The agentic workflow shows strong potential for LLM-based data generation, opening new directions for synthetic data creation methods.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

TL;DR: AFA is a novel attention mechanism that models input sequences as observations of a linear SDE, using learnable dynamics to compute attention weights through maximum likelihood estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more robust attention mechanism that incorporates temporal dynamics and uncertainty propagation, moving beyond direct query-key comparisons.

Method: Models input sequence as discrete observations of linear SDE, uses closed-form solution to differential Lyapunov equation for uncertainty propagation, derives attention weights as maximum likelihood solution with robust residual-based reweighting.

Result: Developed AFA mechanism that can recover standard dot-product attention as a special case, with computational complexity matching standard attention.

Conclusion: AFA provides a principled framework for attention that incorporates dynamics modeling and uncertainty propagation while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to standard attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Conclusion: Speech-based self-supervised learning provides an efficient framework for advancing bioacoustic research, showing strong potential for cross-domain transfer from speech to animal sound analysis.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in

underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal

we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time series forecasting models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks, with user-level attacks achieving perfect detection. New attacks (multivariate LiRA adaptation and DTS) outperform existing methods, showing increased risk with longer prediction horizons and smaller training sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks have been extensively studied on classification models but remain largely unexplored for time series forecasting, creating a significant research gap in understanding privacy risks in this domain.

Method: Introduced two new attacks: (1) adaptation of multivariate LiRA to time-series forecasting, and (2) novel Deep Time Series (DTS) end-to-end learning approach. Benchmarked against adapted classification attacks on TUH-EEG and ELD datasets using LSTM and N-HiTS architectures under record- and user-level threat models.

Result: Forecasting models are vulnerable to membership inference, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. Proposed methods achieved strongest performance in several settings. Vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations.

Conclusion: Time series forecasting models pose significant privacy risks through membership inference attacks. The study establishes new baselines for privacy risk assessment and shows similar vulnerability trends to large language models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

TL;DR: This paper provides a critical analysis and extension of Cai and Wang's work on over-smoothing in GNNs, showing exponential decrease of Dirichlet energy under spectral conditions and extending results to polynomial filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and extend the understanding of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through Dirichlet energy analysis, building upon previous work by Cai and Wang.

Method: Theoretical analysis under mild spectral conditions (including Leaky-ReLU), extension to spectral polynomial filters, and experimental validation through edge deletion and weight amplification tests.

Result: Demonstrates that Dirichlet energy decreases exponentially with depth under specified conditions, and identifies practical scenarios where Dirichlet energy increases, suggesting methods to mitigate over-smoothing.

Conclusion: The analysis provides deeper theoretical insights into over-smoothing phenomena in GNNs and offers practical guidance (edge deletion and weight amplification) for alleviating this issue in real-world applications.

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models face high computational and memory costs during inference, particularly in the decoding stage, making practical deployment challenging.

Method: SBD integrates standard next token prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single architecture, allowing parallel sampling of multiple future tokens using discrete diffusion solvers without architectural changes or extra training parameters.

Result: Fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B with SBD achieved 3-5x reduction in forward passes while maintaining same performance as equivalent NTP training.

Conclusion: SBD provides a simple, flexible paradigm for accelerating language model generation without sacrificing accuracy, maintaining compatibility with existing KV-caching and requiring no architectural modifications.

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

### [202] [One-Embedding-Fits-All: Efficient Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting by a Model Zoo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04208)
*Hao-Nan Shi,Ting-Ji Huang,Lu Han,De-Chuan Zhan,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZooCast is a framework that intelligently combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) into a model zoo, using a unified embedding space to dynamically select the best model for each forecasting task without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different TSFMs excel at different temporal patterns, but no single model performs best universally. The authors want to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple TSFMs through intelligent model selection.

Method: Proposes ZooCast with One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that creates a unified representation space where each TSFM is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for task-specific model selection.

Result: ZooCast demonstrates strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. It also seamlessly integrates new models with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages complementary TSFM capabilities through dynamic model selection, achieving superior zero-shot forecasting performance while maintaining efficiency and scalability for sequential model additions.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

### [203] [Why Can't I See My Clusters? A Precision-Recall Approach to Dimensionality Reduction Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04222)
*Diede P. M. van der Hoorn,Alessio Arleo,Fernando V. Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two supervised metrics (precision and recall) to evaluate the relationship phase of dimensionality reduction, helping explain why expected cluster structures may be missing from projections and guiding hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DR quality metrics don't explain why expected cluster structures are missing from projections, and visual analytics solutions are time-consuming due to large hyperparameter spaces.

Method: Leverages a framework that divides DR into relationship and mapping phases, and introduces precision and recall metrics to evaluate how well modeled relationships align with expected cluster structures based on labels.

Result: The approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection artifacts, and determine if expected structures are captured in relationships, making DR faster and more reliable.

Conclusion: The proposed supervised metrics provide a systematic way to evaluate the relationship phase of DR, addressing limitations of existing methods and improving the reliability of dimensionality reduction processes.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

### [204] [Rethinking the long-range dependency in Mamba/SSM and transformer models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04226)
*Cong Ma,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows SSMs have exponential decay in long-range dependency while transformers are more flexible. A new SSM formulation is proposed to combine attention's flexibility with SSM efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically investigate and compare the long-range dependency modeling capabilities of state-space models (SSM) and transformers, which is crucial for systematic model improvement.

Method: Mathematically define long-range dependency using derivative of hidden states w.r.t. past inputs. Compare SSM and transformer capabilities. Propose new SSM formulation with improved long-range dependency.

Result: SSM's long-range dependency decays exponentially with sequence length (similar to RNN), while attention mechanism in transformers is more flexible without exponential decay constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed new SSM formulation combines the flexibility of attention's long-range dependency with SSM's computational efficiency, proven stable under Gaussian input distribution.

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

*Qifeng Tan,Shusen Yang,Xuebin Ren,Yikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified analytical framework for layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms in differentially private deep learning that reveals existing methods optimize ill-posed objectives and proposes a SNR-Consistent noise allocation strategy for better privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms use heuristic noise allocation strategies without rigorous theoretical grounding, lacking understanding of how noise allocation connects to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs.

Method: Developed a unified analytical framework connecting layer-wise noise injection strategies with implicit optimization objectives and privacy budget allocations. Proposed SNR-Consistent noise allocation strategy that ensures inter-layer signal-to-noise ratio consistency and efficient privacy budget utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments in centralized and federated learning settings show the method consistently outperforms existing allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs with improved signal preservation and privacy budget efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework provides diagnostic insights into prior methods and theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise injection schemes in deep models, addressing fundamental limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

*Idan Shenfeld,Jyothish Pari,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning preserves prior knowledge better than SFT due to smaller KL-divergence from base model, with on-policy RL biased towards KL-minimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why reinforcement learning fine-tuning preserves model capabilities better than supervised fine-tuning despite similar task performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of KL-divergence between fine-tuned and base policies, experimental validation with large language models and robotic foundation models.

Result: RL fine-tuning causes less forgetting due to smaller distributional shift (KL-divergence), with on-policy RL updates naturally preferring solutions closest to original model.

Conclusion: RL's Razor principle: among all solutions for a new task, reinforcement learning prefers those with minimal KL-divergence from the base model, preserving prior knowledge better than supervised approaches.

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

### [208] [An Interactive Framework for Finding the Optimal Trade-off in Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04290)
*Yaohong Yang,Aki Rehn,Sammie Katt,Antti Honkela,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for efficiently finding optimal privacy-accuracy trade-offs in differential privacy by modeling the Pareto front directly and using more informative user interactions instead of pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-objective optimization approaches are inefficient for differential privacy problems because they fail to leverage the unique structure where Pareto optimal points can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy for fixed privacy levels.

Method: Theoretically derive the shape of the privacy-accuracy trade-off to model the Pareto front directly, and replace pairwise comparison feedback with more informative interactions where users select preferred trade-offs from hypothetical curves.

Result: Experiments on differentially private logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets show the method converges to optimal privacy-accuracy trade-offs with significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages the structural properties of differential privacy problems to achieve more efficient multi-objective optimization and preference learning compared to generic methods.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning methods often fail in real-world deployment, especially in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive contexts, which hinders adoption in critical domains like medical diagnosis where they could provide significant benefits if safely deployed.

Method: Introduces causal and statistical structures that cause ML failures in image analysis. Identifies two overlooked problems: 'no fair lunch' and 'subgroup separability'. Analyzes why current fair representation learning methods fail to address these problems.

Result: Current fair representation learning methods are inadequate for solving the identified problems of 'no fair lunch' and 'subgroup separability' that cause ML failures in real-world image analysis applications.

Conclusion: Proposes potential paths forward for the field to address these fundamental problems and enable safer deployment of machine learning methods in high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal
and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for
image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

TL;DR: AT-UCB algorithm leverages causal abstraction theory to efficiently explore coarse-grained CMAB instances before applying UCB on a restricted action set, reducing cumulative regret compared to classical UCB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world decision-making problems can be encoded as causal multi-armed bandits at different abstraction levels, but existing methods lack a general approach to exploit the information and computational advantages across abstraction levels.

Method: Proposes AT-UCB algorithm that uses causal abstraction theory to explore cheap-to-simulate coarse-grained CMAB instances first, then applies traditional UCB on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the target CMAB.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows novel upper bound on cumulative regret. Empirical evaluation on epidemiological simulators with varying resolution demonstrates significant reductions in cumulative regret compared to classical UCB.

Conclusion: AT-UCB effectively exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances at different abstraction levels, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements for decision-making problems.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

TL;DR: Proposes a data-driven behavioral model to analyze energy usage patterns on US Army installations for climate resilience planning and benchmarking future resiliency measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: US Army installations face climate change threats and rely on vulnerable commercial energy/water sources, requiring resilience measures to protect critical mission-supporting infrastructure.

Method: Develops behavioral models to analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal energy usage data from non-residential buildings, using similarly structured open access data due to Army data limitations.

Result: Creates energy usage behavior profiles that enable baseline assessment of disruption impacts and provide benchmarks for future resiliency measures.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology establishes a foundation for understanding energy usage patterns and evaluating resilience strategies for Army installations facing climate-related disruptions.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

*Yin Huang,Yongqi Dong,Youhua Tang,Li Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SST-iTransformer model for parking availability prediction using multi-source transportation data and self-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved spatio-temporal dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address urban parking crisis caused by rapid private car growth by developing accurate parking availability prediction to support urban planning and management, overcoming limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and multi-source data utilization.

Method: Uses K-means clustering to create parking cluster zones (PCZs), integrates traffic demand data from metro, bus, ride-hailing, and taxi. Develops SST-iTransformer with self-supervised pretext tasks and dual-branch attention mechanism (Series Attention for temporal dependencies, Channel Attention for cross-variate interactions).

Result: Outperforms baseline models (Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, iTransformer) with lowest MSE and competitive MAE. Ride-hailing data provides largest performance gains, followed by taxi data, while fixed-route transit features contribute minimally. Spatial correlation analysis shows excluding correlated parking lot data causes significant performance degradation.

Conclusion: SST-iTransformer effectively captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies for parking prediction, with multi-source transportation data integration proving crucial, particularly ride-hailing and taxi data, while demonstrating the importance of modeling spatial correlations within parking cluster zones.

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel active learning strategies that reduce bias between experimental rounds by leveraging bias-variance tradeoff and aleatoric uncertainty, with a cobias-covariance relationship for batching that outperforms canonical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world experiments often have heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty that can be correlated in batched settings, requiring better active learning approaches to handle this uncertainty.

Method: Proposes active learning strategies based on bias-variance tradeoff to reduce bias between rounds, and introduces a cobias-covariance relationship with eigendecomposition for batching historical data.

Result: The difference-based method using cobias-covariance relationship in batched settings with quadratic estimator outperforms canonical methods like BALD and Least Confidence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty and provides superior active learning performance through bias reduction and optimal batching strategies.

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

TL;DR: PagedEviction is a fine-grained KV cache pruning strategy that enhances memory efficiency in LLM inference by using block-wise eviction tailored for paged memory layouts, improving memory usage while maintaining accuracy on long context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching improves LLM inference efficiency but becomes a major memory bottleneck as sequence length increases, requiring better memory management solutions.

Method: Proposes PagedEviction - a structured KV cache pruning strategy with block-wise eviction algorithm designed for paged memory layouts, seamlessly integrating with vLLM's PagedAttention without modifying CUDA kernels.

Result: Evaluation on Llama-3 models using LongBench benchmark shows improved memory usage with better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

Conclusion: PagedEviction effectively addresses KV cache memory bottlenecks while maintaining performance, providing an efficient solution for long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

TL;DR: TiM introduces continuous-time transition models that enable flexible sampling from single-step to multi-step generation, achieving SOTA performance with fewer parameters and monotonic quality improvement with more steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency (few-step generation) and output quality (iterative diffusion models) in generative modeling.

Method: Develops an exact continuous-time dynamics equation that defines state transitions across any finite time interval, creating Transition Models (TiM) that adapt to arbitrary-step transitions.

Result: TiM with 865M parameters outperforms SD3.5 (8B) and FLUX.1 (12B) across all step counts, shows monotonic quality improvement with more steps, and achieves exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Conclusion: TiM provides a novel generative paradigm that successfully bridges the gap between efficiency and quality, offering flexible sampling strategies with superior performance compared to larger models.

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,

### [216] [IPA: An Information-Preserving Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04398)
*Yuan Yin,Shashanka Venkataramanan,Tuan-Hung Vu,Andrei Bursuc,Matthieu Cord*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPA improves LoRA by replacing random down-projection with feature-aware compression that preserves key information, achieving better performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's random initialization of down-projection discards useful information and creates a performance bottleneck, as the down-projection changes little during training while up-projection does most adaptation work.

Method: IPA uses feature-aware projection framework that preserves information in reduced hidden space, approximating top principal components for efficient projector pretraining with minimal inference overhead.

Result: IPA consistently outperforms LoRA and DoRA across language and vision benchmarks, achieving +1.5 points on commonsense reasoning and +2.3 points on VTAB-1k, matching full LoRA performance with half the trainable parameters when projection is frozen.

Conclusion: Feature-aware projection significantly improves parameter-efficient fine-tuning by preserving critical information that random projections discard, enabling better performance with reduced parameter count.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

### [217] [Interpretable Clustering with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning in Mixed Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04415)
*Wenrui Li,Qinghao Zhang,Xiaowo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCL is an unsupervised framework that jointly infers latent clusters and their causal structures from observational data without requiring prior knowledge, addressing limitations in existing methods for causal heterogeneity discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack causal awareness and struggle with modeling heterogeneity, confounding, and observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations.

Method: HCL introduces an equivalent representation encoding structural heterogeneity and confounding, uses a bi-directional iterative strategy to refine causal clustering and structure learning, and employs self-supervised regularization to balance cross-cluster universality and specificity.

Result: Theoretically, HCL shows identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild conditions. Empirically, it achieves superior performance in clustering and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms in real-world single-cell perturbation data.

Conclusion: HCL enables convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns and demonstrates utility for discovering mechanism-level causal heterogeneity in scientific domains like biology and medicine.

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

*Xingtai Lv,Yuxin Zuo,Youbang Sun,Hongyi Liu,Yuntian Wei,Zhekai Chen,Lixuan He,Xuekai Zhu,Kaiyan Zhang,Bingning Wang,Ning Ding,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified framework connects RL and SFT approaches through a single optimization process with a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, leading to Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) that dynamically selects training signals for improved mathematical reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between online (RL) and offline (SFT) training data approaches by showing they are instances of a single optimization process rather than contradictory methods.

Method: Derived a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator with four interchangeable components, then developed Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals for optimal exploitation and exploration.

Result: HPT consistently outperformed strong baselines across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, working effectively across models of varying scales and families.

Conclusion: The unified theoretical framework successfully connects RL and SFT approaches, and HPT demonstrates practical effectiveness by balancing demonstration exploitation with stable exploration while preserving learned reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

*Pradeep Singh,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reframes Echo State Networks as state-space models, providing theoretical foundations for reservoir computing with stability analysis, linearization techniques, and improved training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESNs are currently designed using heuristics rather than first principles. The authors aim to establish a unified theoretical framework connecting reservoir computing with classical system identification and modern state-space models.

Method: The authors: 1) Reformulate ESNs as state-space models with input-to-state stability analysis; 2) Develop small-signal linearizations and Koopman random-feature expansions; 3) Propose Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning with EM for hyperparameter optimization and subspace methods for spectral shaping.

Result: The paper provides verifiable stability conditions, frequency-domain characterizations of memory spectra, and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured SSM kernels. It enables transfer-function and convolutional-kernel analyses.

Conclusion: This systems-theoretic perspective unifies reservoir computing with classical identification methods, provides rigorous stability guarantees, and offers improved training procedures with interpretable frequency-domain insights.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

*Nikolay Kartashev,Ivan Rubachev,Artem Babenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains that the success of modern tabular deep learning methods stems from their implicit handling of data uncertainty, and uses this insight to develop improved numerical feature embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about why recent tabular deep learning techniques perform so well in practice, despite their empirical success.

Method: Analyzes how beneficial design choices in tabular DL (numerical feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models, advanced ensembling) implicitly manage high data uncertainty, and develops new numerical feature embeddings based on these insights.

Result: Provides a unifying explanation for recent performance improvements in tabular DL and develops more effective numerical feature embeddings as a practical outcome.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundational understanding of modern tabular methods' benefits, leads to concrete advancements in existing techniques, and outlines future research directions for tabular deep learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

### [221] [Delta Activations: A Representation for Finetuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04442)
*Zhiqiu Xu,Amish Sethi,Mayur Naik,Ser-Nam Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta Activations is a method to represent finetuned LLMs as vector embeddings by measuring activation shifts from base models, enabling effective clustering by domain/task and supporting model selection and merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of finetuned LLMs has created challenges in navigating and understanding the vast collection of models due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.

Method: Measure shifts in internal activations of finetuned models relative to a base model to create vector embeddings that capture model characteristics.

Result: Delta Activations enable effective clustering by domain and task, are robust across finetuning settings, exhibit additive properties, and support task embedding via few-shot finetuning.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates better organization and reuse of publicly available finetuned models, helping the community navigate the growing landscape of specialized LLMs.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

### [222] [Towards Cognitively-Faithful Decision-Making Models to Improve AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04445)
*Cyrus Cousins,Vijay Keswani,Vincent Conitzer,Hoda Heidari,Jana Schaich Borg,Walter Sinnott-Armstrong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an axiomatic approach to learn cognitively faithful decision models from pairwise comparisons, addressing limitations of standard preference elicitation methods that fail to capture true human cognitive processes like heuristic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference elicitation methods often don't capture true human cognitive processes (e.g., heuristics), resulting in models that don't align with actual decision-making and lack generalization capabilities to other tasks.

Method: An axiomatic approach building on cognitive process literature, defining models where individual features are processed and compared across alternatives, then aggregated via fixed rules like Bradley-Terry, ensuring realistic representation of human decision-making.

Result: The proposed models demonstrated efficacy in learning interpretable models of human decision-making in a kidney allocation task, matching or surpassing the accuracy of prior pairwise decision-making models.

Conclusion: The structured processing approach ensures models are realistic candidates for representing underlying human decision processes, providing more faithful cognitive modeling than standard elicitation methods.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChronoGraph is a new dataset for multivariate time series forecasting with explicit service dependency graphs and real incident annotations from production microservices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the combination of multivariate time series, machine-readable dependency graphs, and real-world anomaly labels needed for realistic microservice system evaluation.

Method: Built from real production microservices with nodes as services emitting performance metrics and directed edges encoding service dependencies, providing expert-annotated incident windows.

Result: Provides baseline results for forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors on this new benchmark.

Conclusion: ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems, addressing gaps in existing datasets.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

### [224] [LibriQuote: A Speech Dataset of Fictional Character Utterances for Expressive Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04072)
*Gaspard Michel,Elena V. Epure,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: LibriQuote dataset provides 18K hours of English speech (12.7K neutral + 5.3K expressive) from audiobooks with contextual metadata and pseudo-labels, enabling expressive TTS fine-tuning and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large TTS datasets lack clear expressive speech proportions, and current expressive corpora are too small for effective fine-tuning, creating a need for a large-scale expressive dataset.

Method: Created LibriQuote dataset from audiobooks with expressive speech from character quotations, adding context and pseudo-labels of speech verbs/adverbs. Includes 7.5-hour test set for benchmarking expressive synthesis while preserving timbre.

Result: Fine-tuning on LibriQuote significantly improves speech intelligibility. Current systems fail to match ground-truth expressiveness and naturalness. The dataset covers wide emotional range and various accents.

Conclusion: LibriQuote enables effective expressive TTS development and benchmarking, with available dataset, code, and audio samples demonstrating its utility for advancing expressive speech synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CTD method uses BERT and contextualized representations to correct speech query errors from ASR systems, achieving superior performance across all metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query spelling correction is crucial for search engines, especially with the growing popularity of speech search through ASR systems that often produce erroneous transcriptions.

Method: Contextualized Token Discrimination (CTD) employs BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations, constructs a composition layer to enhance semantic information, and corrects incorrect tokens by comparing original and contextualized representations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, and a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions is presented for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: CTD provides an effective approach for speech query correction that outperforms existing methods and offers a valuable benchmark for future research in audio query correction.

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

*Qizhou Wang,Hanxun Huang,Guansong Pang,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AUDETER is a large-scale deepfake audio dataset with 4,500+ hours of synthetic audio from 11 TTS models and 10 vocoders, designed to address domain shift issues in deepfake detection and improve generalization of detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods struggle with real-world reliability due to domain shift between training and test samples, and existing datasets lack diverse, up-to-date audio samples that reflect real-world application challenges.

Method: Created AUDETER dataset with over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio (3 million clips) generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders, providing broad coverage of TTS/vocoder patterns for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: SOTA methods trained on existing datasets showed poor generalization to novel deepfake samples and high false positive rates. Methods trained on AUDETER achieved 44.1-51.6% reduction in detection error rate, reaching only 4.17% error on cross-domain samples.

Conclusion: AUDETER enables training of highly generalized deepfake audio detectors and significantly improves detection performance, addressing the critical need for comprehensive datasets to combat evolving speech synthesis technologies.

Abstract: Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that
are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity
challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper connects classical assignment problems to modern optimal transport theory, extending to Gromov-Wasserstein distances for structural matching tasks like QAP. It proposes GW-MultiInit and other variants that achieve near-optimal solutions efficiently for large problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classical assignment problems with modern optimal transport theory and provide efficient solutions for Quadratic Assignment Problems (QAP) and structural matching tasks that traditional methods struggle with at scale.

Method: Connects linear assignment to Monge/Kantorovich transport problems and Wasserstein distances, extends to Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances for different metric spaces, proposes GW-MultiInit with multiple initialization strategy, and develops entropic Sinkhorn approximations and fused GW variants.

Result: GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales efficiently to large problems where exact methods fail. Parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible accuracy-runtime trade-offs.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical foundations, computational insights, and practical guidelines for applying optimal transport and GW methods to QAP and real-world matching problems in machine learning and logistics.

Abstract: The assignment problem, a cornerstone of operations research, seeks an
optimal one-to-one mapping between agents and tasks to minimize total cost.
This work traces its evolution from classical formulations and algorithms to
modern optimal transport (OT) theory, positioning the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP) and related structural matching tasks within this framework. We
connect the linear assignment problem to Monge's transport problem,
Kantorovich's relaxation, and Wasserstein distances, then extend to cases where
source and target lie in different metric-measure spaces requiring
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances. GW formulations, including the fused GW
variant that integrates structural and feature information, naturally address
QAP-like problems by optimizing alignment based on both intra-domain distances
and cross-domain attributes. Applications include graph matching, keypoint
correspondence, and feature-based assignments. We present exact solvers,
Genetic Algorithms (GA), and multiple GW variants, including a proposed
multi-initialization strategy (GW-MultiInit) that mitigates the risk of getting
stuck in local optima alongside entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations and
fused GW. Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show that
GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales
efficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical, while
parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy
and runtime. Our findings provide theoretical foundations, computational
insights, and practical guidelines for applying OT and GW methods to QAP and
other real-world matching problems, such as those in machine learning and
logistics.

TL;DR: First theoretical convergence analysis of shuffling methods for variational inequalities, showing faster convergence than independent sampling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic methods for variational inequalities typically assume independent data sampling, but shuffling heuristics (permuting data before sequential processing) are widely used in practice without theoretical guarantees.

Method: Provided rigorous theoretical convergence estimates and bounds for shuffling methods in variational inequalities, extending the theoretical framework for this class of algorithms.

Result: Established convergence rates for shuffling methods and demonstrated through extensive experiments on benchmark problems that shuffling converges faster than independent sampling approaches.

Conclusion: Shuffling methods for variational inequalities provide superior convergence performance compared to independent sampling, with the first theoretical guarantees now established for this practical approach.

Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine
learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these
problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an
alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves
permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal
consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical
guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We
address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for
shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and
convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class
of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on
diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster
convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models and the predictive power of deep learning architectures in materials science.

Method: Integrates latent representations from multiple pretrained GNN models (MEGNet, ROOST, ORB) with GNN-approximated descriptors and symbolic regression features, augmenting the MODNet feature-based model.

Result: Significant error reductions on Matbench tasks, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks, achieving performance competitive with and often superior to state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs.

Conclusion: MatterVial provides a high-performance, transparent framework that advances materials informatics through explainable AI, enabling more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.

Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for
feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the
feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of
pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based
(MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with
computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from
symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of
traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning
architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench
tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its
performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to,
state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for
multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate
models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into
explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances
materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that
aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted

Conclusion: Presents a promising path for building accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems by combining neural network surrogates with iterative algorithms and domain decomposition methods.

Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and
dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our
platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength
nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate
and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.

*Timothee Robert,MohammadAli Shaeri,Mahsa Shoaran*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: BiND is a two-stage model that first classifies hand movement type then uses specialized GRU decoders to predict continuous hand velocities, outperforming 6 state-of-the-art models in bimanual decoding from intracortical recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings is challenging due to overlapping neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions, requiring improved methods for brain-computer interfaces.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Classify motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual), 2) Use specialized GRU-based decoders with trial-relative time index to predict continuous 2D hand velocities.

Result: Achieved mean R² of 0.76 for unimanual and 0.69 for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing GRU by 2% in both tasks. Showed 4% better robustness to session variability than GRU in cross-session analyses.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling significantly enhances bimanual decoding performance and robustness for BCIs.

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

### [232] [An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03539)
*Chatipat Lorpaiboon,Jonathan Weare,Aaron R. Dinner*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: New committor estimation method that works at any lag time, reducing bias and sensitivity compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing committor estimation methods are biased when using practical lag times, only working optimally at single time steps.

Method: Developed an alternative expression for transition rate minimization that yields exact committor at any lag time, with numerical validation on benchmark systems.

Result: New committor estimates show significantly less sensitivity to lag time choice and provide more accurate transition rate estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust committor estimation across various lag times, with connections to variational approaches and error decomposition analysis.

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

*Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Yiming Wang,Semih Esenlik,Zhaobin Zhang,Kai Zhang,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Systematic study of enhancement filtering techniques in neural video compression, achieving 7.71% bit rate reduction through adaptive in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural video compression efficiency by systematically exploring enhancement filtering techniques that can mitigate error propagation and refine reconstructed frame quality.

Method: Categorized techniques into in-loop contextual filtering (refines temporal context during encoding) and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement. Introduced adaptive coding decision strategy to dynamically apply filtering during encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated a 7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancement filtering approach provides significant coding efficiency improvements and represents the first systematic study of such techniques in conditional-based neural video compression.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in
neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into
in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based
on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.
In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error
propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the
current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering
throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding
decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during
encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to
refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective
improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of
conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a
7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### [234] [EHVC: Efficient Hierarchical Reference and Quality Structure for Neural Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04118)
*Junqi Liao,Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Zhipin Deng,Li Li,Dong Liu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EHVC is an efficient hierarchical neural video codec that addresses reference-quality mismatch through hierarchical multi-reference scheme, enhances quality structure with lookahead strategy, and stabilizes quality with layer-wise scale training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural video codecs show superior coding efficiency but suffer from misalignment between reference structures and hierarchical quality structures, with room for further optimization of quality hierarchy.

Method: Proposes three innovations: 1) hierarchical multi-reference scheme aligning reference and quality structures, 2) encoder-side lookahead strategy using future frames, 3) layer-wise quality scale with random quality training for stability.

Result: EHVC achieves significantly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed EHVC effectively addresses reference-quality mismatch and optimizes hierarchical structures, demonstrating substantial improvements in neural video coding efficiency.

Abstract: Neural video codecs (NVCs), leveraging the power of end-to-end learning, have
demonstrated remarkable coding efficiency improvements over traditional video
codecs. Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in
NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,
less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which
fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In
addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the
hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose
EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key
innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on
traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,
thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to
utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality
structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy
to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC
achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code
will be released in: https://github.com/bytedance/NEVC.

*Marco Vetrano,Tiziano Zingales,G. Massimo Palma,Salvatore Lorenzo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) enable efficient exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval with fault-tolerant quantum computing, reducing computational overhead compared to traditional forward modeling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional exoplanetary atmospheric studies rely on computationally intensive forward models with high-dimensional parameter spaces, creating significant computational overhead that needs to be addressed.

Method: The paper introduces a framework using quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) that employ quantum systems as black boxes for processing input data, with an intrinsically fault-tolerant strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices.

Result: The approach was successfully demonstrated with a direct implementation on IBM Fez quantum hardware, showing fault tolerance and potential for quantum computing in astrophysical data analysis.

Conclusion: QELM architecture demonstrates quantum computing's potential to unlock fast, efficient, and more accurate computational tools for exoplanetary atmospheric studies in the near-term future.

Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models
to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous
chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter
space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum
extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning
techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input
data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary
atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant
strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault
tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we
present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of
astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new
computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.

### [237] [No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in Resume Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404)
*Kyra Wilson,Mattea Sim,Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: People unconsciously adopt AI's racial biases in hiring decisions, favoring candidates from groups that AI prefers up to 90% of the time, even when they think AI recommendations are low quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how human decision-makers are influenced by AI racial bias in collaborative hiring scenarios, particularly examining unconscious associations between race and status.

Method: Conducted a resume-screening experiment (N=528) with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences, using quality-controlled resumes with racial cues through names and affinity groups across 1,526 scenarios. Measured unconscious associations using implicit association tests (IATs).

Result: People select all candidates equally without AI or with unbiased AI, but favor AI-preferred groups up to 90% when AI exhibits bias. IAT completion before screening increases selection of candidates from non-stereotyped groups by 13%. Decisions remain vulnerable to AI bias even when people perceive AI recommendations as low quality.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaborative decision-making is vulnerable to AI bias adoption, requiring organizational and regulatory policies that acknowledge this complexity in system implementation, user education, and oversight determination.

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: Sparse optimization methods for discovering governing equations from data produce models that are sensitive to measurement procedures but generate identical chaotic attractors, challenging traditional equation-based modeling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how imperfect data due to disturbances and measurement errors affects the reliability of sparse-optimization methods in discovering governing equations for chaotic systems.

Method: Analyzed sparse-optimization methods for equation discovery, calculated Koopman spectra to compare different equation sets, and examined eigenvalue patterns across models.

Result: Different equation sets from sparse optimization produce virtually identical chaotic attractors despite being sensitive to measurement procedures. They agree on large eigenvalues but diverge for eigenvalues below equation-dependent thresholds.

Conclusion: Finding governing equations through sparse optimization may lead to misleading physical interpretations. Working directly with data using machine-learning methods is more reliable for complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a
popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering
the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and
measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used
sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models
that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models
generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking
limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling
in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the
different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the
differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an
equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing
equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to
misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the
available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.

Result: Gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable when supported by appropriate visualizations and explanations. Conversational agent successfully lowers cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data through natural language interactions.

Conclusion: Design implications for integrating novel data modalities like eye-tracking in classroom EdTech systems, emphasizing the importance of accessible interfaces and natural language interaction capabilities.

Abstract: Eye-tracking offers rich insights into student cognition and engagement, but
remains underutilized in classroom-facing educational technology due to
challenges in data interpretation and accessibility. In this paper, we present
the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics
dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies
involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data
storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection,
formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings
demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable
when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative
scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large

enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We
conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to
integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A deep learning method for detecting behavior changes in XR through motion analysis without user input, outperforming traditional motion analysis and questionnaires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method for detecting user behavior changes during XR exposures, particularly those associated with the Proteus effect and bodily affordances from avatar embodiment.

Method: A biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning that uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify individual behavior changes. Evaluated against traditional motion analysis and subjective questionnaires in a within-subject study with different avatar heights.

Result: The similarity learning model successfully identified behavior changes across avatar conditions, while subjective assessments confirmed effective body schema manipulation and objective analyses revealed significant movement differences.

Conclusion: The approach offers advantages including in-situ measurement without additional user input, generalizable motion analysis, user-specific individual analysis, and real-time evaluation capabilities for studying avatar-induced behavior changes.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method to detect
user behavior changes during arbitrary exposures in XR systems. Here, such
behavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily
affordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We
present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which
uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior
changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative
approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of
movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires
frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,
participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of
different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments
confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the
(non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed
significant differences across conditions. Our similarity learning model
trained on the motion data successfully identified the elicited behavior change
for various query and reference data pairings of the avatar conditions. The
approach has several advantages in comparison to existing methods: 1) In-situ
measurement without additional user input, 2) generalizable and scalable motion
analysis for various use cases, 3) user-specific analysis on the individual
level, and 4) with a trained model, users can be added and evaluated in real
time to study how avatar changes affect behavior.

TL;DR: HumAIne-chatbot is a personalized AI conversational agent that uses reinforcement learning and user profiling to adapt responses in real-time based on both implicit and explicit user signals, showing significant improvements in user satisfaction and personalization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems provide generic interactions that don't account for individual user characteristics and lack adaptive dialogue management, creating a need for more personalized AI interactions.

Method: The system uses pre-training on GPT-generated virtual personas and online reinforcement learning that combines implicit signals (typing speed, sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (likes/dislikes) to dynamically refine per-user models and inform dialogue policy.

Result: Controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas across multiple conversation domains showed consistent improvements in user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when personalization features were enabled, with statistically significant differences and large effect sizes.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling for personalized conversational agents and provide a strong foundation for future real-world validation of adaptive chatbot systems.

Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all
interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive
dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes
responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained
on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior
over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning
agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,
sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and
dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy,
enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the
system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in
multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in
user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when
personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed
significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions,
with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for
future real-world validation.

TL;DR: Extended gravity well model with dynamic confirmation bias variable improves echo chamber detection on Reddit communities


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing echo chamber models overlook individual confirmation bias, which plays a central role in misinformation spread

Method: Extended established gravity well model by introducing dynamic confirmation bias variable that adjusts pull strength based on user's susceptibility to belief-reinforcing content, calculated from posting history and responses to diverse viewpoints

Result: Validated on 19 Reddit communities, demonstrating improved echo chamber detection and revealing community-level markers of information health

Conclusion: Framework systematically captures confirmation bias role in online group dynamics, enabling more effective echo chamber identification to curb misinformation spread

Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of
misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual
confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well"
model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells.
We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias
variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to
belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through
comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a
wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity
well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals
community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on
nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of
confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective
identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the
model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common
points of amplification.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (Prithvi WxC) creates superior gravity wave parameterizations for climate models compared to traditional ML approaches, showing better predictive performance throughout the atmosphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgrid-scale closures for unresolved atmospheric-oceanic processes like gravity waves are a major source of uncertainty in global climate models, and foundation models remain largely unexplored for climate research applications.

Method: Fine-tuning a 2.3B parameter encoder-decoder foundation model (NASA/IBM's Prithvi WxC) to create deep learning parameterizations that learn gravity wave fluxes from high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis data (10x finer resolution).

Result: The FM parameterization showed superior predictive performance compared to baseline Attention U-Net, with Hellinger distance improving from 0.11 to 0.06, performing well even in regions excluded from pre-training.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer versatile and reusable capabilities for creating observations-driven, physically accurate parameterizations for various earth-system processes, representing a promising new approach for climate modeling.

Abstract: Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes
like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be
sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes
are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to
developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes
by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely
unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3
billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a
latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned
(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity
waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution
climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10
times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous
evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals
superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the
atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost
is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and
0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and
reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere-
and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of
observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more
earth-system processes.

TL;DR: Efficient Virtuoso is a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning that achieves state-of-the-art performance with minADE of 0.25 on Waymo dataset through novel two-stage normalization and efficient MLP denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating diverse and plausible future trajectories for autonomous vehicles with high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control, as current generative models still struggle with these requirements.

Method: Uses a conditional latent diffusion model with two-stage normalization (geometric scaling + PCA latent space normalization), simple MLP denoiser in low-dimensional latent space, and Transformer-based StateEncoder for scene context fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Motion Dataset with minADE of 0.25. Ablation study shows multi-step sparse route goals enable precise tactical execution mirroring human driving behavior.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines computational efficiency with high-fidelity trajectory generation, demonstrating that rich multi-step goal representations are essential for nuanced human-like driving behavior in autonomous systems.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

TL;DR: INGRID is an AI framework that automatically designs parallel robotic mechanisms using screw theory and kinematic synthesis, enabling novel mechanism creation without specialized robotics expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic systems are constrained by serial mechanisms, limiting robotic intelligence. There's a need to decouple AI advances from hardware constraints by enabling automated design of parallel mechanisms.

Method: Decomposes design into four tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. Integrates reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods with deep learning.

Result: Successfully generates novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, including configurations not previously documented. Validated through three case studies showing task-specific parallel robot design based on mobility requirements.

Conclusion: INGRID bridges mechanism theory and machine learning, enabling researchers without robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms. Establishes foundation for mechanism intelligence where AI actively designs robotic hardware.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-arm visuotactile framework for garment manipulation that combines confidence-aware visual correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to handle crumpled and suspended clothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clothing manipulation is challenging due to complex configurations, variable material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten garments or assume visibility of key features.

Method: Uses a correspondence model trained on custom simulated dataset with distributional loss for cloth symmetries, plus visuotactile grasp affordance network self-supervised with tactile feedback. Features reactive state machine that adapts strategies based on perceptual uncertainty.

Result: System handles highly occluded table-top and in-air configurations by deferring action in low-confidence states. Demonstrates task-agnostic grasp selection in folding and hanging tasks.

Conclusion: Dense descriptors provide reusable intermediate representation for other planning modalities, enabling extraction of grasp targets from human demonstrations, paving way for more generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of teleoperation for robotic data collection by creating a more natural and efficient method that provides rich sensory data (vision + tactile) for dexterous manipulation tasks while maximizing transferability to real robots.

Method: Developed DEXOP - a passive hand exoskeleton that mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing direct contact feedback via proprioception and mirroring human hand poses to the passive robot hand for natural task demonstrations.

Result: DEXOP enables high-quality demonstration data collection at scale across diverse dexterous, contact-rich tasks. Policies learned with DEXOP data significantly improve task performance per unit time compared to teleoperation.

Conclusion: DEXOP represents an effective paradigm (perioperation) for robotic data collection that enhances human demonstration capabilities and provides superior data transfer to robots, making it a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning that achieves 90% success rate with 10x faster runtime than numerical planners, using deep learning trained on planner-generated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical planning approaches for robotic motion planning have significant runtime requirements, creating a need for faster alternatives that maintain good performance.

Method: Uses diffusion-based deep learning model trained on dataset from numerical planners. Initially employed point cloud embeddings and keypoint-based joint sequence prediction, but found conditioning on point clouds challenging. Refined dataset to address biases.

Result: Model outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude in runtime while achieving up to 90% success rate for collision-free solutions on test set, even without point cloud encodings.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based learning approach provides significantly faster motion planning with high success rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from planner-generated datasets despite initial conditioning challenges.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

*Hongyin Zhang,Shiyuan Zhang,Junxi Jin,Qixin Zeng,Yifan Qiao,Hongchao Lu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ARFM introduces offline RL fine-tuning for VLA flow models using adaptive scaling to balance RL advantage preservation and flow loss variance control, improving action accuracy in complex robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA flow models rely solely on imitation learning and struggle with action accuracy on complex tasks due to insufficient understanding of data quality distribution properties, which RL can address.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM) - an offline RL fine-tuning algorithm that introduces an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in VLA flow model loss to create a principled bias-variance trade-off objective.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: ARFM successfully bridges RL and flow matching for VLA models, providing stable and efficient fine-tuning that significantly improves action accuracy on complex robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Conclusion: The proposed divergence-kernel formula and pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm provide effective tools for linear response computation in random dynamical systems, enabling new forward-only diffusion generative modeling approaches.

Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response
(parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random
dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula
works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it
does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm
for linear responses. With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative
model and test on simple problems.

*John Wentworth,David Lorell*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Conditions for translating latent variables between Bayesian agents with different generative models but same predictive distributions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when one agent can guarantee their latent variables are a function of another agent's latents when both have converged on the same predictive distribution but may have different generative models

Method: Develops mathematical conditions (natural latent conditions) under which translation between latent variables is guaranteed, with theorems that are robust to approximation error

Result: Identifies necessary and sufficient conditions for translatability between different generative models that share the same predictive distribution

Conclusion: The natural latent conditions provide the most general guarantee for translating between different latent variable representations while maintaining robustness to approximation errors

Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same
environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive
distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but
may have different generative models containing different latent variables.
Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function
of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be
possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further
constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability
is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to
approximation error in the natural latent conditions.

Motivation: Protoplanetary disks are planet birthplaces, but traditional methods cannot capture their complex 3D structure at the unprecedented resolution provided by ALMA observations, requiring new modeling approaches.

Method: Developed RadJAX - a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line radiative transfer solver that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable rendering for high-dimensional neural reconstructions.

Result: Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, the framework recovered the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au that was missed by existing approaches.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for extracting complex disk structure and advancing understanding of protoplanetary evolution through high-speed, differentiable radiative transfer modeling.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their
three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The
unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture

rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line
radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on I/O, off-chip memory, and host control in deep learning inference by leveraging predictable neural network behavior for efficient computation and communication planning.

Method: Uses fine-grained message passing on a programmable, message-based compute architecture with techniques like stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions to keep data movement local and coordinate computation across arrays.

Result: Achieves 88-92% utilization on VGG-19, with 97% internally generated messages, 89% on-chip transfer time, computation throughput scaling beyond 1 TFLOP/s, and traffic reductions up to 100 MB per layer from reuse and local aggregation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables streaming-based computation through tight coordination of data and instruction flow, demonstrating significant efficiency gains in deep learning inference execution.

Abstract: We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s
on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation
reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness
of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution
style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simple strategies with limited memory are believed to produce better controllers that are easier to understand, produce, and maintain. The paper aims to examine the complexity requirements of strategies in various synthesis scenarios.

Method: The paper discusses recent results concerning memory and randomness requirements in game-theoretic controller synthesis, analyzing different synthesis contexts and going beyond traditional notions of strategy complexity.

Result: The contribution provides insights into the complexity of strategies needed across different synthesis problems, examining both memory requirements and the role of randomness in strategy design.

Conclusion: Understanding strategy complexity (memory and randomness requirements) is crucial for developing effective controllers in game-theoretic synthesis approaches, with implications for controller design and implementation.

Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the
interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game
between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal)
strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a
real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited
memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive
and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a
variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and
randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions
of complexity for strategies.

Motivation: Existing debugging datasets focus on function-level code repair, neglecting more complex repository-level scenarios, leading to incomplete understanding of LLMs' debugging challenges in real-world settings.

Method: Introduces RepoDebug - a multi-task, multi-language repository-level debugging dataset with 22 error subtypes, supporting 8 programming languages and 3 debugging tasks, then evaluates 10 LLMs on this dataset.

Result: Evaluation shows Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs best but still struggles with repository-level debugging, indicating current LLMs have significant limitations in complex debugging scenarios.

Conclusion: Repository-level debugging remains a challenging problem for LLMs, and RepoDebug provides a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in this area beyond function-level capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python packages have increasing vulnerability concerns with complex multi-language interactions, but current detection tools' effectiveness remains underexplored, requiring a reliable benchmark.

Method: Created PyVul benchmark with 1,157 developer-verified vulnerabilities, using LLM-assisted data cleansing for accuracy. Provided commit and function-level annotations and conducted distribution analysis and tool evaluation.

Result: Achieved 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy. Found vulnerabilities involve multiple languages, multi-lingual packages are more susceptible, and existing tools have significant capability gaps.

Conclusion: PyVul establishes the most precise Python vulnerability benchmark, revealing critical limitations in current detection tools and highlighting the need for future advancements in multi-lingual vulnerability detection.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

Result: 96.86% overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores: 98.55% (Physical Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), 98.68% (Daily Living), outperforming baselines by 1.18%.

Conclusion: COBRA provides robust, generalizable behavioral monitoring with low demographic variance (<3%), enabling scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and continuous lifestyle monitoring.

Abstract: Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance
behaviors, yet traditional self-reported methods suffer from significant
underreporting and recall bias, and difficulty in integration with modern

hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head
self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily
activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical
Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart

preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving
high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86%
overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical

### [259] [A Small Dataset May Go a Long Way: Process Duration Prediction in Clinical Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03522)
*Harald Störrle,Anastasia Hort*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: Simple statistical methods outperform complex models in predicting surgery durations using small datasets when combined with expert domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing operating theater utilization through better surgery scheduling can reduce hospital costs and improve medical outcomes. Previous approaches required large datasets and complex models.

Method: Combined factor analysis and regression models guided by practitioner expertise and domain knowledge, using limited clinical data in a theory-guided approach.

Result: Simple central tendency methods performed equally or better than complex literature models. Expert knowledge integration improved both data quality and model performance.

Conclusion: Integrating conventional data science with qualitative clinical studies enables effective prediction even with small datasets, yielding better results than previous complex approaches.

Abstract: Context: Utilization of operating theaters is a major cost driver in
hospitals. Optimizing this variable through optimized surgery schedules may
significantly lower cost and simultaneously improve medical outcomes. Previous
studies proposed various complex models to predict the duration of procedures,
the key ingredient to optimal schedules. They did so perusing large amounts of
data.
  Goals: We aspire to create an effective and efficient model to predict
operation durations based on only a small amount of data. Ideally, our model is
also simpler in structure, and thus easier to use.
  Methods: We immerse ourselves in the application domain to leverage
practitioners expertise. This way, we make the best use of our limited supply
of clinical data, and may conduct our data analysis in a theory-guided way. We
do a combined factor analysis and develop regression models to predict the
duration of the perioperative process.
  Findings: We found simple methods of central tendency to perform on a par
with much more complex methods proposed in the literature. In fact, they
sometimes outperform them. We conclude that combining expert knowledge with
data analysis may improve both data quality and model performance, allowing for
more accurate forecasts.
  Conclusion: We yield better results than previous researchers by integrating
conventional data science methods with qualitative studies of clinical settings
and process structure. Thus, we are able to leverage even small datasets.

### [260] [Hypothesis Selection: A High Probability Conundrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03734)
*Anders Aamand,Maryam Aliakbarpour,Justin Y. Chen,Sandeep Silwal*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Improved time complexity for hypothesis selection from O~(n/(δ³ε³)) to O~(n/(δε²)) while maintaining optimal sample complexity and approximation factor C=3. Also studied three alternative settings: optimal approximation for expected distance, known OPT case with improved runtime, and preprocessing approach with subquadratic runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The hypothesis selection problem aims to find a distribution from a candidate set that closely approximates an unknown distribution P. Despite decades of research, optimal running time with the best approximation factor (C=3) and sample complexity remained unresolved, particularly regarding parameter dependencies.

Method: Developed improved algorithms that reduce time complexity dependence on confidence (δ) and error (ε) parameters. Also explored three alternative problem settings: expected distance minimization, known OPT case, and preprocessing approaches.

Result: Achieved time complexity of O~(n/(δε²)), significantly improving over previous O~(n/(δ³ε³)). For known OPT case, obtained O~(n/ε²) runtime. With preprocessing, achieved subquadratic runtime while maintaining C=3 approximation.

Conclusion: The work resolves key open problems in hypothesis selection, providing optimal or near-optimal algorithms across multiple settings with improved time complexities while maintaining the best possible approximation factor and sample efficiency.

Abstract: In the hypothesis selection problem, we are given a finite set of candidate
distributions (hypotheses), $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, and samples
from an unknown distribution $P$. Our goal is to find a hypothesis $H_i$ whose
total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the nearest hypothesis
in $\mathcal{H}$. If the minimum distance is $\mathsf{OPT}$, we aim to output
an $H_i$ such that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, its total variation
distance to $P$ is at most $C \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \varepsilon$.
  Despite decades of work, key aspects of this problem remain unresolved,
including the optimal running time for algorithms that achieve the optimal
sample complexity and best possible approximation factor of $C=3$. The previous
state-of-the-art result [Aliakbarpour, Bun, Smith, NeurIPS 2024] provided a
nearly linear in $n$ time algorithm but with a sub-optimal dependence on the
other parameters, running in $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta^3\varepsilon^3))$ time. We
improve this time complexity to $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$,
significantly reducing the dependence on the confidence and error parameters.
  Furthermore, we study hypothesis selection in three alternative settings,
resolving or making progress on several open questions from prior works. (1) We
settle the optimal approximation factor when bounding the \textit{expected
distance} of the output hypothesis, rather than its high-probability
performance. (2) Assuming the numerical value of \textit{$\mathsf{OPT}$ is
known} in advance, we present an algorithm obtaining $C=3$ and runtime
$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ with the optimal sample complexity and succeeding
with high probability in $n$. (3) Allowing polynomial \textit{preprocessing}
step on the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ before observing samples, we present
an algorithm with $C=3$ and subquadratic runtime which succeeds with high
probability in $n$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical studies of judicial panels face ethical and practical barriers; need for simulating deliberation processes to assess justice system efficacy and fairness.

Method: MAS with agents (Judge, Prosecution/Defense Counsel, Adjudicators) using LLMs + RAG pipeline with Indian legal documents (IPC, Constitution) for grounded legal arguments and citations.

Result: System enables iterative deliberation rounds with case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach consensus verdicts; provides configurable platform for legal reasoning simulation.

Conclusion: SAMVAD offers explainable judicial simulation tailored to Indian legal context with verifiable legal grounding, enhancing fidelity and transparency in group decision-making studies.

Abstract: Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for
assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical
studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical
barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)
designed to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the
Indian justice system.
  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a
Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a
judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal
documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable
legal grounding via RAG.

TL;DR: NeuroBreak is a top-down jailbreak analysis system that examines neuron-level safety mechanisms in large language models to identify vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing better defenses against jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment in LLMs creates urgent security concerns, but analyzing security weaknesses in these complex models with vast parameters is challenging.

Method: Developed NeuroBreak system through expert collaboration, incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis to examine model decision-making and critical neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives.

Result: The system provides comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak methods and offers mechanistic insights through quantitative evaluations and case studies.

Conclusion: NeuroBreak enables deeper understanding of LLM security mechanisms and vulnerabilities, facilitating the development of next-generation defense strategies against evolving jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo
safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the
continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass
safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on
the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks
requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and
vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex
structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal
perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down
jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms
and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through
collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system
provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By
incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a
novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its
generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical
neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper
exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and
case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic
insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving
jailbreak attacks.

*Yifan Jia,Yanbin Wang,Jianguo Sun,Ye Tian,Peng Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LMAE4Eth is a multi-view learning framework that combines transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge to significantly improve Ethereum fraud detection, outperforming 21 baselines by over 10% F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods fail to capture transaction semantics and face challenges with homogeneous transaction records, suboptimal node-level performance, and scalability issues in graph learning methods.

Method: Proposes TxCLM for transforming numerical transactions into linguistic representations using contrastive learning, and MAGAE with generative self-supervised learning for account detection, integrated via cross-attention fusion with layer-neighbor sampling for scalability.

Result: Outperforms 21 baseline approaches on three datasets, achieving over 10% improvement in F1-score on two datasets.

Conclusion: LMAE4Eth effectively addresses limitations of current methods by fusing transaction semantics and graph embeddings, demonstrating superior performance and scalability for Ethereum fraud account detection.

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: KubeGuard is a runtime log-driven recommender framework that uses LLMs to analyze Kubernetes manifests and logs, generating least-privilege configurations to address overly permissive security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes security challenges from misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Existing solutions focus on detection rather than mitigation.

Method: Uses large language models with modular prompt-chaining workflows to analyze manifests and runtime logs, performing Resource Creation and Resource Refinement tasks to generate least-privilege configurations.

Result: High precision, recall, and F1-scores demonstrate effectiveness in generating and refining manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments using both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: KubeGuard successfully translates runtime observability into actionable security recommendations, providing a practical framework for hardening Kubernetes environments through least-privilege configurations.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native
applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as
misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to
address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions
focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or
anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime
log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly
permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments
through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs
reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.
This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for
new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.
KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,
developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our
evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s
manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both
proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores
affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime
observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.

TL;DR: Integration of echo-state networks and model predictive path integral control for fast online learning and control of nonlinear systems, with uncertainty-aware extension that improves performance by up to 60%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast online identification and control of unknown nonlinear dynamics remain central challenges in data-driven control systems

Method: Reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) combines echo-state networks for fast nonlinear dynamics learning with parallelized MPPI control without linearization. Extended to uncertainty-aware URPPI that balances exploration and exploitation based on ESN uncertainty

Result: Experiments on Duffing oscillator and four-tank systems show URPPI reduces control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based MPC methods

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics and effective control without linearization approximations, with uncertainty-aware version providing significant performance improvements

Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found
extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems.
However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain
central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) --
reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and
model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of
model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir
predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics
with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI
control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is
further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN
uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs
dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model
confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and
four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing
control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based
model predictive control methods.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A method for efficiently verifying Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) using Lipschitz arguments and sample-efficient certification algorithms, validated through numerical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Control Invariant sets are crucial for certifying safety in dynamical systems, but computing CBFs involves complex robust optimization problems that can be intractable. Scenario-based methods simplify computation but require verification of robust constraints.

Method: The approach uses Lipschitz arguments to verify if CBFs satisfy robust constraints, forming the basis of a sample-efficient certification algorithm.

Result: The proposed procedure was validated through numerical examples, demonstrating its efficiency in verifying CBFs.

Conclusion: The Lipschitz-based verification approach provides an efficient method for certifying Control Barrier Functions, addressing the computational challenges of robust optimization in safety certification for dynamical systems.

Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of
dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to
compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However,
computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization
problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to
simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually
satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this
verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a
certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical
example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional state estimation requires extensive manual system identification. Foundation models could reduce deployment effort through zero-shot capabilities, but current transformer approaches are limited to sensor models seen during training.

Method: Combines transformer-based model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) framework, allowing generalization across different sensor configurations.

Result: Demonstrates competitive accuracy, effort, and robustness trade-off on container ship benchmark compared to classical methods and end-to-end approaches, with open-sourced benchmark and dataset.

Conclusion: FM-UKF enables zero-shot state estimation by leveraging pre-trained dynamics models with analytical sensor integration, providing a foundation model approach that generalizes across varying system and sensor configurations.

Abstract: State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires
extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However,
transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data
requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately,
developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically
reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based
end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they
are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation
model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based
model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF,
enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new
sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship
models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and
robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system
knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open
sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via
foundation models.

TL;DR: Data-driven hybrid control strategy for Li-ion battery charging that combines reinforcement learning with formal methods to optimize charging speed while minimizing capacity loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between fast charging and battery ageing/capacity loss in Li-ion batteries through improved Battery Management Systems.

Method: Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis combining Reinforcement Learning for controller synthesis with data-driven formal methods to create hybrid switched control structure based on battery measurements.

Result: Developed a hybrid system with discrete selection among RL-based controllers that provides probabilistic guarantees on closed-loop battery performance.

Conclusion: The approach enables data-driven charging protocol design with formal performance guarantees, balancing charging speed and battery longevity.

Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of
modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such
batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by
Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental
challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and
the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We
rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to
data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain
a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,
and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched
structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The
resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the
continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the
desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the
closed-loop performance of the cell.

TL;DR: Data-driven motion planning for multi-agent systems using convex optimization to learn safe controllers from experimental data without explicit system models, ensuring collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable homogeneous linear multi-agent systems to operate safely in obstacle-filled environments without requiring explicit system models, using only experimental data and convex optimization.

Method: Each agent independently learns closed-loop behavior by solving convex semidefinite programs to generate locally invariant ellipsoids and state-feedback gains. A sampling-based planner constructs waypoint trees with transitions allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, coordinated through space-time reservation tables for inter-agent safety.

Result: The framework produces dynamically feasible trajectories that are provably safe with respect to environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions, with local controllers enabling execution without runtime optimization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively synthesizes synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents using only data and convex optimization tools, demonstrating practical applicability for model-free multi-agent motion planning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of patients required in clinical trials while maintaining statistical power by leveraging LLM-encoded clinical expertise for better Bayesian modeling of adverse events.

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian framework that systematically elicits parametric priors from pre-trained LLMs for hyperparameters, avoiding synthetic data generation and directly incorporating external clinical expertise.

Result: LLM-derived priors consistently outperform traditional meta-analytical approaches in predictive performance, as validated through temperature sensitivity analysis and cross-validation on real clinical trial data.

Conclusion: This approach enables more efficient clinical trial design with substantial patient reductions for robust safety assessment, potentially transforming drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision-making.

Abstract: Imagine a world where clinical trials need far fewer patients to achieve the
same statistical power, thanks to the knowledge encoded in large language
models (LLMs). We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling
of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed
prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate
synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from
the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for
hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM,
enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into
Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity
analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we
demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance
compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the
way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling
substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust
safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring
and regulatory decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based lighting estimation is constrained by scarce and expensive ground-truth HDR environment maps. Existing approaches struggle with indirect visual cues, global context inference, and HDR output recovery.

Method: Fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer on large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting. Uses low-rank adaptation finetuning strategy with collected HDR panoramas dataset for better semantic alignment between input and predicted environment maps.

Result: Produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency details. Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Generalizes effectively to real-world scenes.

Conclusion: LuxDiT successfully addresses lighting estimation challenges by leveraging diffusion transformers and synthetic training data, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods while overcoming data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: ContraGS enables training compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting models using codebooks and Bayesian inference, reducing memory usage 3.49x while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires large GPU memory for high-quality representations, creating inefficiencies in training and rendering due to memory access and data movement issues.

Method: Uses codebooks to compactly store Gaussian parameter vectors and employs Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling to learn non-differentiable parameters in compressed representations.

Result: Achieves 3.49x memory reduction, 1.36x faster training, and 1.88x faster rendering while maintaining close to state-of-the-art quality.

Conclusion: ContraGS provides an effective framework for training compressed 3DGS models without quality degradation, making high-quality 3D scene modeling more accessible.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

### [273] [TensoIS: A Step Towards Feed-Forward Tensorial Inverse Subsurface Scattering for Perlin Distributed Heterogeneous Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04047)
*Ashish Tiwari,Satyam Bhardwaj,Yash Bachwana,Parag Sarvoday Sahu,T. M. Feroz Ali,Bhargava Chintalapati,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A learning-based framework called TensoIS that uses low-rank tensor components to estimate heterogeneous subsurface scattering parameters modeled with Fractal Perlin noise from multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating scattering parameters either use analysis-by-synthesis approaches or differentiable rendering, but few learning-based methods exist and they assume homogeneous media. There's no known distribution to explicitly model real-world heterogeneous scattering parameters.

Method: Created HeteroSynth dataset with photorealistic images of heterogeneous media using Fractal Perlin noise. Proposed TensoIS framework that uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent 3D scattering volumes from sparse multi-view observations.

Result: Evaluated on unseen heterogeneous variations, smoke/cloud geometries from realistic simulations, and real-world samples, demonstrating effectiveness for inverse scattering.

Conclusion: This study explores Perlin noise distribution as a potential model for real-world heterogeneous scattering in a feed-forward manner, addressing the lack of well-defined distributions in literature.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

### [274] [SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04058)
*Lei Zhong,Yi Yang,Changjian Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SMooGPT uses fine-tuned LLMs for stylized motion generation through body-part text reasoning, enabling interpretable control and better generalization to new styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation methods suffer from low interpretability, limited generalization to new styles, and strong bias towards walking motions in public datasets. The authors observe that human motion can be effectively described using natural language in body-part centric manner and LLMs can understand and reason about human motion.

Method: Proposes reasoning-composition-generation approach using body-part text space as intermediate representation. SMooGPT is a fine-tuned LLM that acts as reasoner, composer, and generator for stylized motion in body-part text space.

Result: The method achieves higher interpretability, enables fine-grained motion control, resolves conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles due to LLMs' open-vocabulary ability.

Conclusion: Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, particularly for pure text-driven stylized motion generation, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

### [275] [Hyper Diffusion Avatars: Dynamic Human Avatar Generation using Network Weight Space Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04145)
*Dongliang Cao,Guoxing Sun,Marc Habermann,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel two-stage method that combines person-specific rendering with diffusion models to generate high-quality dynamic human avatars with realistic pose-dependent deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches are limited - person-specific methods don't generalize across identities, while generative methods produce lower-quality static avatars without realistic pose-dependent deformations like cloth wrinkles.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Optimize person-specific UNets for each avatar capturing pose-dependent deformations, 2) Train hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights for weight generation during inference.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods, enabling real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars with high photorealism.

Conclusion: Successfully unites person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to achieve both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations in dynamic human avatar generation.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a PDE-solving framework that eliminates the need for computing derivatives of the solution neural network, making it more efficient and suitable for complex second-order PDEs.

Method: Uses weak adversarial formulation with random difference operators applied to test functions instead of the solution network, creating a fully derivative-free approach.

Result: The method is particularly well-suited for solving Fokker-Planck type second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs without requiring derivative computations of the neural network.

Conclusion: ARDO provides an effective derivative-free deep learning framework for PDE solutions, offering significant advantages for handling complex second-order PDE problems like Fokker-Planck equations.

Abstract: We propose ARDO method for solving PDEs and PDE-related problems with deep
learning techniques. This method uses a weak adversarial formulation but
transfers the random difference operator onto the test function. The main
advantage of this framework is that it is fully derivative-free with respect to
the solution neural network. This framework is particularly suitable for
Fokker-Planck type second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs.

*Niclas Dern,Lennart Redl,Sebastian Pfister,Marcel Kollovieh,David Lüdke,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: EWFM enables continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art sample quality with significantly fewer computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from complex Boltzmann distributions is computationally challenging, and existing methods either require large datasets of target samples or cannot effectively leverage advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows when trained only with energy evaluations.

Method: Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM) reformulates conditional flow matching via importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal distributions. Two algorithms are developed: iterative EWFM (iEWFM) for progressive proposal refinement, and annealed EWFM (aEWFM) with temperature annealing for challenging energy landscapes.

Result: On benchmark systems including 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, the algorithms demonstrate sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.

Conclusion: EWFM provides an efficient framework for sampling from Boltzmann distributions using only energy function evaluations, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining high sample quality.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions
$\mu_{\text{target}}(x) \propto \exp(-E(x)/T)$, is fundamental to many
scientific applications yet computationally challenging due to complex,
high-dimensional energy landscapes. Existing approaches applying modern
generative models to Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of
samples drawn from the target distribution or, when using only energy
evaluations for training, cannot efficiently leverage the expressivity of
advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows that have shown
promise for molecular sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce
Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling
continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy
function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via
importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal
distributions. Based on this objective, we develop two algorithms: iterative
EWFM (iEWFM), which progressively refines proposals through iterative training,
and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), which additionally incorporates temperature
annealing for challenging energy landscapes. On benchmark systems, including
challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, our algorithms demonstrate
sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while
requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational efficiency challenges in diffusion model inference for synthetic data generation by integrating compressed sensing techniques.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) compress data into latent space, (2) train diffusion model in latent space, (3) apply compressed sensing algorithm to generated latent samples. Includes derivation of optimal latent dimension.

Result: Proved faster convergence under sparsity assumptions. Conducted numerical experiments on diverse datasets including images (handwritten digits, medical, climate) and financial time series.

Conclusion: The integration of compressed sensing with diffusion models enables efficient synthetic data generation with faster convergence and optimal latent space utilization across various data types.

Abstract: This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion
model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to
integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into
a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii)
apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent
space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under
suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to
enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse
recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space
dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets,
including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and
financial time series for stress testing.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Four novel methods for testing correlation between node features and network structure, with two linear model-based approaches and two canonical correlation analysis methods that avoid linear assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether nodal covariates are correlated with network structure in applications where networks have node-level features, providing computationally efficient methods with fewer modeling assumptions.

Method: Two methods use linear models relating covariates to latent variables driving network structure. Two methods apply canonical correlation analysis between features and network structure without linear modeling assumptions.

Result: Theoretical guarantees provided for low-rank latent space models with high-dimensional covariates. Methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer assumptions than previous approaches.

Conclusion: Novel methods effectively test network dependency with computational efficiency and reduced modeling requirements, validated on simulated and real-world data.

Abstract: In many application domains, networks are observed with node-level features.
In such settings, a common problem is to assess whether or not nodal covariates
are correlated with the network structure itself. Here, we present four novel
methods for addressing this problem. Two of these are based on a linear model
relating node-level covariates to latent node-level variables that drive
network structure. The other two are based on applying canonical correlation
analysis to the node features and network structure, avoiding the linear
modeling assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for all four methods
when the observed network is generated according to a low-rank latent space
model endowed with node-level covariates, which we allow to be
high-dimensional. Our methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer
modeling assumptions than previous approaches to network dependency testing. We
demonstrate and compare the performance of our novel methods on both simulated
and real-world data.

TL;DR: Bayesian inverse problem formulation using triangular normalizing flows for simulation and inference, combining upper and lower triangular maps into one invertible mapping with direct training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Bayesian inverse problems by developing a generative model capable of both simulation (sampling from likelihood) and inference (sampling from posterior) in a unified framework.

Method: Uses triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling, combines upper and lower triangular maps into one invertible mapping, proposes direct training loss for the map.

Result: Developed a new invertible generative model with useful properties for conditional generative modeling, demonstrated through numerical examples.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective framework for Bayesian inverse problems by unifying simulation and inference capabilities through combined triangular normalizing flows.

Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a
generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood)
and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of
triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show
how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one
invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out
several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a
possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the
workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on
a few stylized examples.

TL;DR: Novel bandit framework for MNL-based stochastic matching with efficient batched algorithms achieving O(1) amortized computational cost and Õ(√T) regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem in stochastic matching where naive approaches incur O(K^N) computational cost per round, making real-world applications impractical.

Method: Proposed batched algorithms that limit matching update frequency, reducing amortized computational cost to O(1) while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Result: Achieved Õ(√T) regret bound for cumulative revenue maximization from successful matches, significantly improving computational efficiency from exponential to constant amortized cost.

Conclusion: The batched algorithm framework successfully balances computational efficiency and performance, making stochastic matching with MNL choice model practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching
based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents
on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm
stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown
preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize
regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all
agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based
on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur
a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we
propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates,
thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per
round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

TL;DR: Machine learning analysis of genomic and epidemiological data predicts rising antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter, with potential economic burden exceeding 1.9 billion GBP annually by 2050 if unchecked.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance poses significant public health and economic challenges, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness, particularly for Campylobacter infections.

Method: Used machine learning (Random Forest with bootstrap resampling) on genomic and epidemiological data from PubMLST and UK surveillance databases, incorporating whole-genome sequencing data, epidemiological metadata, and economic projections. Also employed time-series forecasting models (SARIMA, SIR, Prophet).

Result: Achieved 74% accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes, identified key resistance determinants (gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone, tet(O) gene for tetracycline), and projected rising campylobacteriosis cases potentially exceeding 130/100,000 people by 2050.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance patterns, highlighting the urgent need for intervention to prevent significant economic burden.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic
challenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.
This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data
from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity
(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by
the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns
in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK
from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,
epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance
determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We
investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene
for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with
bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%
accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,
SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially
exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden
projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced
Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by
incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend
modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing

*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RAG systems are vulnerable to misinformation from retrieved evidence, especially adversarial content. Health domain evaluation shows adversarial documents degrade alignment, but helpful evidence can preserve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems reduce LLM hallucinations but introduce vulnerability to misinformation, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare where incorrect responses can cause harm.

Method: Controlled experiments using health questions, varying document types (helpful, harmful, adversarial) and question framing (consistent, neutral, inconsistent), measuring alignment with ground-truth answers.

Result: Adversarial documents substantially degrade alignment between model outputs and ground truth, but robustness is preserved when helpful evidence is present in the retrieval pool.

Conclusion: Retrieval safeguards are needed for safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains, as the presence of helpful evidence can mitigate the negative impact of adversarial content.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: NER Retriever is a zero-shot framework for ad-hoc named entity retrieval that uses LLM internal representations instead of fixed schemas, achieving superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NER requires predefined entity types, but real-world scenarios need flexible retrieval based on user-defined type descriptions without pre-specified schemas or fine-tuned models.

Method: Uses mid-layer transformer block value vectors from LLMs to embed entities and type descriptions, trains lightweight contrastive projection network to align type-compatible entities in shared semantic space.

Result: Significantly outperforms lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines on three benchmarks, produces compact, type-aware embeddings suitable for nearest-neighbor search.

Conclusion: Demonstrates empirical support for optimal representation selection within LLMs and provides practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER

TL;DR: ACT framework automatically finds minimal hyperparameter changes to satisfy guardrail constraints in recommender systems, using offline pairwise evaluation and continuous retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems need to maximize primary objectives while ensuring secondary constraints (guardrails) are met, but manual hyperparameter tuning is challenging and doesn't adapt well to system changes.

Method: Automated Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework that uses offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find minimal hyperparameter changes, with continuous retraining to adapt to system and user behavior changes.

Result: Empirically demonstrated efficacy and successfully deployed in a large-scale production environment.

Conclusion: ACT provides an automated solution for maintaining guardrail constraints in recommender systems without manual tuning, adapting continuously to system changes.

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional global-to-local image retrieval misses partial matches and is computationally expensive. Emerging efficient local feature search enables detailed retrieval at scale, while global feature re-ranking shows promise for efficiency.

Method: Proposes local-to-global paradigm where efficient local feature search is combined with global feature re-ranking. Global features are computed on-the-fly using multidimensional scaling to create embeddings that respect local similarities from the search phase.

Result: Demonstrates solid retrieval performance and sets new state-of-the-art results on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

Conclusion: The local-to-global paradigm with on-the-fly global feature computation based on local similarities provides significant re-ranking boost and outperforms traditional approaches.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotation for relevance evaluation is expensive and slow, limiting scalability for personalized search systems. Need automated solution that maintains quality.

Method: Fine-tuned LLMs to generate relevance judgments, rigorously validated against human annotations for alignment and reliability.

Result: LLMs provide reliable relevance measurement comparable to human annotations, greatly improving evaluation efficiency and enabling expanded query sets and optimized sampling.

Conclusion: LLM-based automation enables higher-quality relevance metrics, reduces Minimum Detectable Effect in experiments, and allows scalable assessment of diverse search experiences.

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in understanding and retrieving complex technical content from hardware/software documentation by improving semantic retrieval capabilities.

Method: Leverage LLMs for query expansion to capture user intent, apply summary extraction for contextual encoding, and fine-tune bi-encoder BERT model with soft prompting using separate parameters for queries and documents.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline models in both precision and recall on RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA datasets.

Conclusion: Integration of query expansion and contextual summarization effectively enhances technical document retrieval, advancing RAG systems for engineering workflows.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for
efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product
development workflows.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages diverse data sources through scalable upstream embedding generation and downstream integration, demonstrating substantial improvements in Pinterest's personalized content and ad delivery systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

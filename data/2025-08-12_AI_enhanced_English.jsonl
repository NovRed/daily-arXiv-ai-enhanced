This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows\na 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on\nMATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements\nover the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Such\nconflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to\nadopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated\nknowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel \"unlearn-then-learn\"\nstrategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting\nand Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach\nis powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets\nthe specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.\nThrough a rigorous experimental methodology on\nmicrosoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically\ninformed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the\nnew, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original\nconflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits\nunprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed\nas low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted\ninterpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals\na nuanced mechanism of \"soft forgetting,\" where original knowledge is\nsuppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally\naccessible, enhancing model safety and control.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)\naddresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during\ninference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods\nexploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of\nlow-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to\nout-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical\nchallenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution\nshifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded\nadaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to\naccommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal\npredictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache\nEnhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively\nstoring high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by\ndynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and\niteratively refined using an exponential moving average and\nexploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise\ndecision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse\nvisual distributions.

Indeed, the skill\nand confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly\ninfluenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model\ndevelopment, thus yielding the colloquialism \"garbage in, garbage out.\" As\nsuch, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input\ndata for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to\ndecadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers,\ndevelopers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate\npredictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such\napplications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are\nusing are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in\nthis article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with\nnon-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data,\nand handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex\ndistributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing\ntechniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can\ncreate confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process.

### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR is a Transformer-based model that learns batch-effect-robust cellular morphology representations, enabling out-of-distribution generalization to unseen datasets without retraining, outperforming traditional batch correction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive heterogeneous datasets, but technical batch effects and lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks that hinder cross-study analysis.

Method: Introduces CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture with source-specific context tokens designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are robust to batch effects without requiring retraining on new data.

Result: Outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in batch integration and biological signal preservation on JUMP dataset. Maintains high performance on challenging OOD task with unseen Bray et al. dataset despite significant domain and feature shifts.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step towards creating truly foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and scalable cross-study biological analysis through robust batch-effect handling and OOD generalization.

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal fusion architecture combining YOLOv8n and Vision Transformer with audio features improves railway defect detection accuracy by 0.2 points over vision-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single modality approaches like YOLO detectors have limitations in railway defect detection, causing overdetection when structural elements appear similar to defects. Audio signals recorded by microphones can provide complementary information to improve detection accuracy.

Method: Proposes a multimodal fusion architecture using YOLOv8n for rapid object detection and Vision Transformer to combine feature maps from multiple layers (7, 16, 19) with synthesized audio representations. Fusion is performed between audio and image modalities for detecting rail rupture and surface defects.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real-world railway dataset shows multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points compared to vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test confirms statistical significance of accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion combining visual and audio information effectively addresses limitations of single-modality approaches in railway defect detection, providing statistically significant improvements in detection accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ClaFR, a post-hoc OOD detection method that uses classifier weight decomposition to create class-known subspace projections, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring training data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-based OOD detection methods often require access to training data, which poses privacy concerns. The authors aim to develop a method that maintains high performance while eliminating the need for training data access.

Method: ClaFR performs orthogonal decomposition of classifier weights to extract class-known subspace, maps original features into this subspace, and calculates OOD scores based on feature reconstruction error within the subspace.

Result: The method achieves leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks without requiring access to training data, demonstrating effectiveness in privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Conclusion: ClaFR provides a simple yet effective solution for OOD detection that preserves data privacy by eliminating training data dependency while maintaining competitive performance with existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP is a simple continued pretraining strategy that adapts foundation models to new domains using minimal data (1000 images) with stable performance across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains often have small datasets that limit SSL methods and make hyperparameter search infeasible, while pretrained models lack information needed for continued pretraining.

Method: Uses a simple objective requiring no labels, introduces no additional hyperparameters beyond supervised finetuning, and works with any strong foundation model.

Result: Provides significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models like DINOv3 using only 1000 images, stable across data modalities and backbone choices.

Conclusion: DIET-CP effectively bridges the gap for continued pretraining in specialized domains with limited data, offering a simple and stable solution.

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT enhances adversarial robustness in Federated Prompt Tuning by addressing class information gaps through a class-aware prompt generator and cross-layer sharing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Prompt Tuning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially under non-IID settings where clients lack global label information for robust training.

Method: Proposes FedAPT with: 1) Class-aware prompt generator using Global Label Embedding as a beacon, 2) Cross-layer generator sharing strategy for enhanced prompt coupling across model layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedAPT significantly outperforms existing methods in adversarial robustness and demonstrates exceptional generalization in cross-domain and cross-dataset scenarios.

Conclusion: FedAPT effectively addresses class information gaps in federated learning, providing superior adversarial robustness and practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD framework bridges the gap between academic VLM evaluation and enterprise needs by testing 10 real-world business tasks on a diverse 7,500-sample benchmark with innovative OCR comparison methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks use multiple-choice questions and synthetic data that don't reflect real enterprise deployment requirements like social media content analysis.

Method: Developed ViLD framework with 10 business-critical tasks, created benchmark of 7,500 real-world samples, and introduced BlockWeaver Algorithm for comparing unordered OCR outputs without embeddings/LLMs.

Result: Benchmarked leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, InternVL) against proprietary baseline, providing industry-grounded assessment with actionable deployment insights.

Conclusion: ViLD offers comprehensive enterprise-focused evaluation framework that addresses real-world business needs and provides practical guidance for VLM deployment in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome is a self-supervised learning system that uses DICOM headers to improve medical image analysis performance, achieving AUROC 0.901 and better calibration across CT, MRI, and CXR modalities from multiple vendors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical imaging through PACS/DICOM involves procedure choices that create latent confounders affecting image quality, which impede generalization of image-only networks across different sites and scanners.

Method: Uses structured DICOM headers as labels with three approaches: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation to learn protocol-aware but clinically robust image representations.

Result: Achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs 0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on external validation. Shows significant improvements in three clinical tasks: +0.046 for PE detection, +0.058 for glioma grading, +0.041 for cardiomegaly detection, with 25-37% calibration improvements.

Conclusion: Protocol Genome effectively reduces false positives at protocol borders, works with limited labeled data (10-20%), and is clinically applicable through standard PACS/DICOM interfaces, providing more robust medical image analysis across diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

### [9] [Visible Yet Unreadable: A Systematic Blind Spot of Vision Language Models Across Writing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06996)
*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision language models show poor resilience to fragmented and occluded text that humans can easily read, revealing structural limitations in handling compositional writing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether advanced vision language models share humans' remarkable resilience in recognizing words from fragmented, fused, or partially occluded characters across different writing systems.

Method: Constructed two psychophysics-inspired benchmarks using Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to create 'visible but unreadable' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans.

Result: Contemporary VLMs showed severe performance drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs despite strong performance on clean text, indicating they rely heavily on generic visual invariances but underutilize compositional priors.

Conclusion: The findings reveal structural limitations in current VLMs and motivate the need for architectures and training strategies that better encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts for robust literacy applications.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

### [10] [K-Syn: K-space Data Synthesis in Ultra Low-data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06997)
*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel frequency-domain feature learning approach for dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction that synthesizes k-space data using temporal fusion strategies, enabling robust performance even with ultra low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic cardiac MRI faces challenges due to scarce high-quality k-space data, which hampers robust reconstruction. Traditional image-domain methods are limited, requiring a more effective approach to handle data scarcity.

Method: Feature-level learning directly in frequency domain using Fourier transform's global representation capacity. Employs temporal-fusion strategies to integrate k-space data across time frames and optimize generative trajectory.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate strong generative ability in low-data regimes, showing practical potential to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain feature modeling with temporal fusion enables stable and rich k-space data generation, offering a promising solution for dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction with limited data.

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

### [11] [Not All Splits Are Equal: Rethinking Attribute Generalization Across Unrelated Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06998)
*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Models struggle to generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and perceptually dissimilar categories, showing sharp performance drops when test categories are unrelated to training categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether current models can abstract and apply attribute knowledge to conceptually distant categories, moving beyond narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains.

Method: Introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation between training and test sets using LLM-driven semantic grouping, embedding similarity thresholding, clustering, and supercategory-based partitioning.

Result: Performance sharply decreases as correlation between training and test categories reduces, with clustering providing the most effective trade-off between reducing hidden correlations and preserving learnability.

Conclusion: Current models show strong sensitivity to split design and have limitations in attribute reasoning across unrelated categories, providing insights for future benchmark construction.

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop framework for quantitative evaluation of LLM-generated 3D models with comprehensive metrics to assess geometric and structural fidelity against ground truth CAD references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models can interpret multimodal inputs to generate 3D shapes, but robust evaluation methods for geometric and structural fidelity are underdeveloped, limiting applications like CAD democratization and rapid prototyping.

Method: Proposed a suite of similarity and complexity metrics (volumetric accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, topological intricacy) and systematically compared LLM performance across four input modalities using an L-bracket case study.

Result: Code-level prompts achieved perfect reconstruction across all metrics, with improved generation fidelity observed with increased semantic richness. The quantitative evaluation approach enabled significantly faster convergence toward ground truth compared to traditional qualitative methods.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of AI-assisted shape synthesis and provides a scalable methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of quantitative evaluation over visual inspection.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

### [13] [MEGS$^{2}$: Memory-Efficient Gaussian Splatting via Spherical Gaussians and Unified Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07021)
*Jiarui Chen,Yikeng Chen,Yingshuang Zou,Ye Huang,Peng Wang,Yuan Liu,Yujing Sun,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS² is a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reduces VRAM usage by 50% for static memory and 40% for rendering memory while maintaining quality, through optimized primitive management and lightweight color representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has high memory consumption that limits its use on edge devices. Most existing compression methods focus only on storage compression and fail to address rendering memory bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes MEGS² framework that jointly optimizes primitive number and parameters per primitive. Replaces memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes for color representation. Introduces unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem.

Result: Achieves 50% static VRAM reduction and 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: MEGS² successfully addresses the critical memory bottleneck in 3DGS rendering, making it more suitable for edge devices through efficient memory optimization techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to

*Jisung Hwang,Jaihoon Kim,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussian distribution in latent space, combining moment-based spatial regularization with power spectrum-based spectral regularization for improved text-to-image model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate downstream optimization tasks in text-to-image models by ensuring latent space samples follow standard Gaussian distribution, preventing reward hacking and improving convergence.

Method: Treats high-dimensional samples as 1D Gaussian variables, uses composite loss with spatial moment regularization and spectral power spectrum regularization, applied to randomly permuted inputs for permutation invariance.

Result: Outperforms previous Gaussianity regularization methods, effectively prevents reward hacking, and accelerates convergence in test-time reward alignment for aesthetics and text alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework for Gaussian regularization provides superior performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods, enabling better optimization in text-to-image model latent spaces.

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reward function-based optimization for fine-tuning foundational segmentation models like SAM, enabling real-time streaming data analysis in microscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational models like SAM have many non-transparent tuning parameters requiring manual optimization, limiting usability for real-time streaming data analysis in microscopy.

Method: Introduce reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models, constructing reward functions based on physics of imaged system (particle size distributions, geometries, etc.) to create optimized variant SAM*.

Result: Enhanced SAM's adaptability and performance, creating SAM* that better aligns with diverse segmentation tasks and enables real-time streaming data segmentation.

Conclusion: Reward-driven optimization framework effectively improves foundational models for microscopy imaging, enabling precise segmentation of cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features in real-time.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

### [17] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aymara benchmark reveals LMMs systematically amplify occupational gender stereotypes, showing 93% male representation in male-stereotyped jobs vs 22.5% in female-stereotyped, with significant model variation proving bias is not inevitable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address methodological limitations in prior gender bias research and create a standardized, large-scale benchmark for assessing social bias in AI-generated images from large multimodal models.

Method: Tested 13 commercial LMMs using 75 gender-neutral prompts across stereotypically-male, female, and non-stereotypical professions, then used validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score 965 images for gender representation.

Result: LMMs amplify occupational stereotypes (93% male in male-stereotyped vs 22.5% in female-stereotyped professions), show strong default-male bias (68.3% male in non-stereotyped jobs), with model variation from 46.7% to 73.3% male representation.

Conclusion: Gender bias in LMMs is not inevitable but results from design choices; standardized automated evaluation tools are necessary for accountability and fairness in AI development.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

*Chung-Shien Brian Wang,Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes block-sparse attention to replace dense global attention in transformer-based multi-view reconstruction models, achieving 4x faster inference without retraining while maintaining comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models like VGGT and π³ face runtime bottlenecks due to quadratic complexity of global attention layers, limiting scalability to large image sets.

Method: Replaces dense global attention with highly optimized block-sparse kernels based on observed concentration of attention probability mass on cross-view geometric matches.

Result: Achieves up to 4x faster inference with comparable task performance, requires no retraining, and supports large image collections.

Conclusion: Block-sparse attention effectively addresses scalability limitations in multi-view reconstruction transformers while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised detection and recovery mechanism for Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) security threats in offloaded VR systems, protecting against pose spoofing attacks that cause drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offloading VIO to edge servers creates security vulnerabilities where subtle pose spoofing attacks can accumulate into significant drift while evading existing heuristic checks, compromising VR immersion and accuracy.

Method: Proposed an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery model trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal motion regularities, enabling runtime deviation detection and pose consistency restoration.

Result: Evaluation in realistic offloaded-VIO environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities showed substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to no-defense baseline.

Conclusion: The unsupervised approach effectively detects and recovers from pose spoofing attacks in offloaded VIO systems, providing security without requiring labeled attack data.

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

*Muhammad Saad Saeed,Ijaz Ul Haq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face enhancement techniques, both traditional and GAN-based, significantly reduce deepfake detection accuracy by distorting biometric features, achieving attack success rates up to 75.12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether face enhancement methods, while improving perceptual quality, can inadvertently degrade deepfake detector performance and serve as anti-forensic tools.

Method: Systematic evaluation using traditional image processing and GAN-based enhancement methods on FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2 datasets. Testing on Naïve, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods, plus adversarial training experiments.

Result: Basic enhancement filters reduced detection accuracy with ASR up to 64.63%, while GAN-based techniques achieved even higher ASR up to 75.12%. Face enhancement methods effectively function as anti-forensic tools.

Conclusion: Face enhancement techniques pose a serious threat to deepfake detection systems, highlighting the need for more resilient and adaptive forensic methods to counter these anti-forensic approaches.

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

*Erencem Ozbey,Dimitrios I. Diochnos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully unsupervised approach for novel class discovery using Vision Transformers and manifold learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple image datasets without requiring known cluster counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning requires extensive human labeling effort, and real-world applications often encounter novel classes that weren't present during training. Existing approaches focus on semi-supervised methods, but there's a need for fully unsupervised solutions to identify novel categories.

Method: Uses Vision Transformers with attention mechanisms to generate vector embeddings, then incorporates manifold learning techniques to refine embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data for enhanced image clustering performance.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art results on single-modal clustering and Novel Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet, working effectively both when the number of clusters is known or unknown.

Conclusion: The proposed fully unsupervised approach successfully addresses the open-world problem of discovering novel classes without requiring labeled data, outperforming previous methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [22] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet is a dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal model for breast ultrasound segmentation that combines global image semantics with local boundary precision using text prompts from clinical metadata, achieving state-of-the-art performance especially for small lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast ultrasound segmentation is challenging for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle noise. Existing text-image approaches produce coarse responses that smear boundaries, requiring better integration of clinical context with precise edge recovery.

Method: XBusNet uses a dual-branch architecture: a global pathway with CLIP Vision Transformer for whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size/location, and a local U-Net pathway modulated by text prompts describing shape, margin, and BI-RADS terms. Prompts are automatically assembled from structured metadata without manual input.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU dataset with mean Dice of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six baselines. Small lesions show largest gains with fewer missed regions and spurious activations. Ablations confirm complementary contributions of global context, local modeling, and prompt modulation.

Conclusion: The dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design effectively merges global semantics with local precision, producing accurate segmentation masks and improving robustness for challenging small, low-contrast breast ultrasound lesions.

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging, particularly in breast cancer classification using thermograms.

Method: Uses DPM for superior data augmentation, fuses deep features from ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (Fractal Dimension) from U-Net segmented tumors, and employs XGBoost classifier.

Result: Achieves 98.0% accuracy and 98.1% sensitivity, with ablation studies confirming statistical significance of both DPM augmentation and feature fusion.

Conclusion: Validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecA is a resource-efficient post-training method that improves multimodal models by using visual understanding embeddings as dense text prompts for self-supervised image reconstruction, enhancing both generation and editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional training of unified multimodal models relies on sparse image-text pairs that miss fine-grained visual details, limiting the alignment between visual understanding and generation capabilities.

Method: Reconstruction Alignment (RecA) conditions UMMs on their own visual understanding encoder embeddings and optimizes them to reconstruct input images using self-supervised reconstruction loss, without requiring additional captions.

Result: With only 27 GPU-hours, RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73→0.90) and DPGBench (80.93→88.15), while boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25). It works across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs.

Conclusion: RecA is an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy that consistently improves generation and editing fidelity across diverse UMM architectures, surpassing larger open-source models.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

### [25] [DEPF: A UAV Multispectral Object Detector with Dual-Domain Enhancement and Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07327)
*Shucong Li,Zhenyu Liu,Zijie Hong,Zhiheng Zhou,Xianghai Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel UAV multispectral object detector called DEPF is proposed to address challenges in low-light image enhancement, local target modeling interference, and computational complexity. It uses dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three key challenges in UAV multispectral object detection: low-light image quality reducing modality complementarity, redundant information interfering with local target modeling, and high computational complexity limiting transformer-based methods on UAV platforms.

Method: Proposes DEPF with two main components: 1) Dual-Domain Enhancement Module (DDE) with Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba for global brightness enhancement and Fourier Details Recovery for texture recovery; 2) Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) that uses priority scanning starting from local target features based on modality difference scores.

Result: Experiments on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets show that DEPF performs well on object detection tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The DEPF framework effectively addresses the three challenges through its dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion approach, demonstrating superior performance in UAV multispectral object detection with linear computational complexity.

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: G$^{3}$CN - a novel graph convolutional network with Gaussian topology refinement and GRU gating to better distinguish ambiguous actions in skeleton-based recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GCNs struggle to distinguish between ambiguous actions due to limitations in representing topological and spatial features effectively.

Method: Proposes G$^{3}$CN that incorporates a Gaussian filter to refine skeleton topology graphs and integrates GRUs into GCN framework to enhance information propagation between skeleton points.

Result: Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks show G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition, particularly for ambiguous samples, with strong generalization across GCN backbones.

Conclusion: The proposed G$^{3}$CN approach successfully addresses the challenge of distinguishing ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition through topology refinement and enhanced information propagation.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

*Shibang Liu,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGVL introduces a novel Guided Module for visual-language fusion in human pose estimation, using parse graphs to maintain occluded region responses through hierarchical cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual-language fusion methods weaken occluded region responses and cause alignment failures in human pose estimation, while language offers rich spatial priors for occluded scenes.

Method: Parse Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with Guided Module, using low-level nodes for local features and high-level nodes for global integration, with recursive bidirectional cross-attention purified by GM.

Result: Validated on major pose estimation datasets, showing improved performance in handling occluded areas.

Conclusion: PGVL effectively fuses multimodal information through hierarchical parse graph interaction, addressing occlusion challenges in human pose estimation.

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive

*Ze-Xin Yin,Jiaxiong Qiu,Liu Liu,Xinjie Wang,Wei Sui,Zhizhong Su,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGAA is a novel framework for end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation that unifies geometry and material modeling using multi-view diffusion priors with a modular design and efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation methods focus mainly on geometry and treat texture synthesis as post-processing, lacking end-to-end PBR material generation capabilities needed for professional 3D asset creation.

Method: Modular framework with three components: LGAA Wrapper (reuses MV diffusion model layers), LGAA Switcher (aligns multiple diffusion priors), and LGAA Decoder (VAE for predicting 2D Gaussian Splatting with PBR channels), plus post-processing for mesh extraction.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated through extensive experiments with both text- and image-conditioned multi-view diffusion models, achieving high-quality relightable mesh assets with efficient convergence using only 69k training instances.

Conclusion: LGAA successfully enables end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation by effectively leveraging diffusion priors and modular design, providing a flexible and data-efficient solution for professional 3D content creation.

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

*Taiying Peng,Jiacheng Hua,Miao Liu,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoGazeVQA is a new benchmark for egocentric gaze-guided video question answering that addresses the gap in existing benchmarks by incorporating gaze information as a key indicator of user intent in longer daily-life videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent in egocentric videos, which capture user focus, actions, and context in a unified coordinate system for proactive and personalized AI experiences.

Method: The authors introduce EgoGazeVQA benchmark consisting of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. They propose gaze-guided intent prompting methods that integrate spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues, and conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions, while the proposed gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance. The study also analyzes how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness.

Conclusion: Gaze information is valuable for creating more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings, as it provides crucial cues about user intent that significantly improve MLLM performance in understanding longer daily-life videos.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

*Xudong Lu,Zhi Zheng,Yi Wan,Yongxiang Yao,Annan Wang,Renrui Zhang,Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Qingyun Li,Weifeng Lin,Xiangyu Zhao,Xue Yang,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLEAM introduces a unified cross-view geo-localization framework with multi-modal alignment (GLEAM-C) and explainable reasoning (GLEAM-X), addressing limitations of single-view approaches and lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL approaches are restricted to single views/modalities and lack interpretability - they only predict matches without explaining the reasoning behind correspondences between different geographical perspectives.

Method: Two-phase approach: GLEAM-C aligns multiple views (UAV, street maps, panoramas, ground photos) with satellite imagery using optimized implementation. GLEAM-X leverages MLLMs for explainable reasoning, with bilingual benchmark data generated by GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro and human-refined.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models while providing interpretable correspondence analysis through the integrated GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X pipeline.

Conclusion: The framework unifies accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning, advancing geo-localization transparency and scalability by enabling models to both explain and match cross-view correspondences.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

### [31] [XOCT: Enhancing OCT to OCTA Translation via Cross-Dimensional Supervised Multi-Scale Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07455)
*Pooya Khosravi,Kun Han,Anthony T. Wu,Arghavan Rezvani,Zexin Feng,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT is a deep learning framework that uses cross-dimensional supervision and multi-scale feature fusion for layer-aware OCT-to-OCTA translation, improving vascular reconstruction quality for retinal disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCT-to-OCTA translation methods overlook vascular differences across retinal layers and struggle with reconstructing intricate vascular details needed for reliable diagnosis. High-quality OCTA acquisition is challenging due to motion sensitivity and high costs.

Method: Proposes XOCT framework with Cross-Dimensional Supervision (CDS) using 2D layer-wise en-face projections as supervisory signals, and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network with channel reweighting for multi-scale vascular detail capture.

Result: Experiments on OCTA-500 dataset show significant improvements, especially for en-face projections critical for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies.

Conclusion: XOCT enhances OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine unlearning techniques can effectively mitigate bias in vision models by selectively removing biased samples/features, achieving up to 97.37% fairness improvement with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data, leading to biased predictions in safety-critical domains. Conventional bias mitigation requires retraining from scratch, but machine unlearning offers a post-hoc alternative.

Method: Evaluated various unlearning strategies including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation on three benchmark datasets (CUB-200-2011, CIFAR-10, CelebA) to address different bias types like pose bias, synthetic patch bias, and gender bias.

Result: Achieved substantial subgroup disparity reductions: 94.86% improvement on CUB-200, 30.28% on CIFAR-10, and 97.37% on CelebA. Methods scored average 0.62 across utility, fairness, quality, and privacy metrics with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning establishes a practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without requiring full retraining, making it an effective post-hoc bias mitigation approach.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method combining implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models to automate vector graphic animation while preserving scalability and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics offer scalability and user-friendliness but animating them requires substantial manual effort. Existing techniques have limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Method: Uses layered implicit neural representations to reconstruct vector graphics, bridges domain gap with diffusion models, optimizes with video score distillation sampling using motion priors from text-to-video diffusion models, then warps vector graphics to match representations.

Result: Generates vivid and natural vector graphic animations with significant improvement over existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates vector graphic animation while preserving inherent properties like infinite resolution and precise constraints, demonstrating superior performance compared to current approaches.

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Method: Fine-tuned BLIP-2 model using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset, and proposed a refined evaluation metric that emphasizes directional and sequential variables beyond standard BERT F1 score.

Result: The model significantly improved in generating directional instructions after applying LoRA, overcoming limitations of the original BLIP-2 model.

Conclusion: The integrated vision-language approach with specialized fine-tuning and evaluation metrics provides an effective solution for indoor navigation assistance, enhancing accessibility and independence for visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGS integrates Signed Distance Field learning into 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve surface reconstruction while maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS achieves photorealistic rendering but struggles with accurate surface reconstruction due to its unstructured nature and lack of explicit geometric supervision.

Method: Associates each Gaussian with a learnable SDF value to align primitives with geometry, and uses geometry-guided grid growth strategy for adaptive Gaussian distribution under multi-scale hierarchy.

Result: Consistently improves reconstruction accuracy and completeness on DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks&Temples benchmarks while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: DiGS successfully bridges the gap between rendering quality and geometric accuracy in 3DGS by incorporating SDF learning and geometry-aware optimization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

*Chun Liu,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel adversarial attack framework using local mixing and logits optimization to enhance transferability and address gradient vanishing issues in non-targeted attacks on remote sensing DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in remote sensing applications. Current mixing-based strategies destroy global semantic features and suffer from gradient diminishing during optimization, compromising adversarial example quality.

Method: 1) Local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent inputs by blending local regions only; 2) Adapts logit loss from targeted to non-targeted attacks to mitigate gradient vanishing; 3) Applies perturbation smoothing loss to suppress high-frequency noise.

Result: Superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Achieves 17.28% average improvement in black-box attack success rate on MTARSI dataset with ResNet as surrogate.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing mixing-based strategies by preserving global semantics and solving gradient vanishing, resulting in significantly improved adversarial attack transferability for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

*Saad Lahlali,Alexandre Fournier Montgieux,Nicolas Granger,Hervé Le Borgne,Quoc Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAT is a weakly supervised 3D object detection framework that uses temporal multi-view data and teacher-student distillation to achieve state-of-the-art performance without 3D box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data annotation is costly, and existing weak supervision methods using only 2D boxes suffer from projection ambiguities and partial visibility issues in single viewpoints.

Method: Leverages temporal multi-view data to aggregate object-centric point clouds across time, uses teacher-student distillation where teacher learns from aggregated static objects and generates pseudo-labels for student to learn from single viewpoints, and incorporates multi-view 2D projection loss for consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets, significantly narrowing the gap with fully supervised methods without requiring 3D box annotations.

Conclusion: MVAT effectively addresses projection ambiguities and partial visibility challenges in weakly supervised 3D object detection through temporal multi-view aggregation and distillation, demonstrating strong performance comparable to fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Conclusion: EHWGesture serves as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture understanding with precise tracking and embedded action quality evaluation.

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

### [42] [Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530)
*Kiet T. Nguyen,Chanhuyk Lee,Donggyun Kim,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UFC is a universal few-shot control adapter that enables text-to-image diffusion models to generalize to novel spatial control conditions with minimal training data (30 examples) while achieving competitive performance with fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial control adapters for diffusion models lack adaptability to novel control conditions and require high training costs when encountering tasks that differ substantially from training data.

Method: UFC uses few-shot learning with image-condition pairs, leveraging analogy between query and support conditions through a matching mechanism and updating a small set of task-specific parameters to construct control features.

Result: Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show UFC achieves fine-grained control with only 30 annotated examples, and with 0.1% of full training data, it matches performance of fully supervised baselines across various control tasks.

Conclusion: UFC provides an effective few-shot solution for spatial conditioning in diffusion models, working across different architectures (UNet and DiT) and requiring minimal training data for novel control tasks.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced Masked Image Modeling for 3D medical images using HU-based Foreground Masking that focuses on diagnostically meaningful tissue regions instead of random masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in MIM overlooks anatomical object density in 3D medical imaging, failing to focus on diagnostically meaningful regions like visceral organs while including non-tissue areas like air and fluid.

Method: Implemented HU-based Foreground Masking using Hounsfield Unit measurements to focus on intensity distribution of visceral organs and exclude non-tissue regions lacking diagnostic features.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across five public 3D medical imaging datasets with segmentation quality and Dice scores: BTCV:~84.64%, Flare22:~92.43%, MM-WHS:~90.67%, Amos22:~88.64%, BraTS:~78.55%.

Conclusion: Domain-centric MIM with HU-based masking is crucial for medical image representation learning, offering a promising direction for improved medical image segmentation performance.

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextlessRAG is the first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over document images that eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, using a fully textless pipeline with layout-aware reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document images contain rich knowledge and spoken queries offer portability and flexibility, but no prior work has explored combining visual document QA with speech queries directly.

Method: End-to-end framework that directly interprets speech, retrieves relevant visual knowledge from document images, and generates answers without intermediate text conversion. Includes layout-aware reranking to improve retrieval performance.

Result: Substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to prior methods. Also releases the first bilingual speech-document RAG dataset with Chinese and English voice queries paired with multimodal document content.

Conclusion: TextlessRAG successfully demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of textless speech-based question answering over visual documents, providing a new direction for multimodal document understanding with speech interfaces.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

*Peng Li,Yisheng He,Yingdong Hu,Yuan Dong,Weihao Yuan,Yuan Liu,Zilong Dong,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from single unposed images using synthetic data and coarse-to-fine pipeline with dual-branch feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, which are slow for inference. There's also a lack of large-scale 3D head assets for training.

Method: Proposes a feed-forward framework using synthetic data from 3D GANs, coarse-to-fine Gaussian generation pipeline with transformer blocks, and dual-branch framework combining spherical triplane features with point-based features.

Result: Enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference with single forward pass. Experimental results show effectiveness compared to existing work.

Conclusion: The framework successfully achieves efficient high-fidelity Gaussian full-head synthesis from single unposed images using synthetic training data and advanced feature aggregation techniques.

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CGAT architecture for transparent 3D shape recognition using graph attention networks with explainable attention mechanisms, applied to dental age estimation from CBCT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the black-box nature of deep learning models in high-stakes applications like medicine and forensics by creating transparent and trustworthy 3D shape recognition models.

Method: Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) with graph attention convolutions and attention rollout visualization, using local mean curvature and distance to centroid as node features on 3D meshes from CBCT images.

Result: Models with directed edges to global CLS node produced intuitive attention maps and good classification performance (0.76 weighted F1 score), with combined node features yielding best results.

Conclusion: CGAT enables human-understandable explanations through attention maps, enhancing trust and facilitating expert validation, making it broadly applicable to graph-based tasks in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

*Robert Jöchl,Andreas Uhl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive review of temporal image forensics focusing on time-dependent traces from image acquisition pipelines, examining sensor defects, content bias issues, and the importance of explainable AI for reliability verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a thorough overview of temporal image forensics techniques that estimate image age using time-dependent traces from acquisition pipelines, while addressing critical issues like content bias and the need for reliable verification methods.

Method: The review analyzes previous works, re-implements methods when necessary, conducts experiments to verify properties of age traces (sensor defects and dust), investigates neural network feature learning, and proposes a new forensic setting.

Result: Findings include: verification of in-field sensor defect properties, demonstration that some methods actually exploit content bias rather than age traces, investigation of neural network feature learning in palmprint dating, and showing how neural networks can be easily distracted from learning genuine age traces.

Conclusion: The review highlights the critical problem of content bias in temporal image forensics and emphasizes the importance of explainable AI methods to ensure the reliability and validity of age estimation techniques, while providing new insights and a more realistic forensic framework.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

*Yusuke Hirota,Ryo Hachiuma,Boyi Li,Ximing Lu,Michael Ross Boone,Boris Ivanovic,Yejin Choi,Marco Pavone,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Noa Garcia,Yuta Nakashima,Chao-Han Huck Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current gender bias evaluations in vision-language models are unreliable because they're heavily influenced by spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features like objects/backgrounds, not actual gender bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether spurious features in gender bias benchmarks distort evaluation results and undermine the reliability of current bias assessment methods.

Method: Systematically perturb non-gender features across four benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, PHASE) and various VLMs, testing minimal perturbations like object masking (10%) and background blurring to quantify impact on bias scores.

Result: Minimal perturbations dramatically alter bias scores - up to 175% shift in generative VLMs and 43% in CLIP variants, showing current evaluations reflect model responses to spurious features rather than actual gender bias.

Conclusion: Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally challenging, bias metrics should be reported alongside feature-sensitivity measurements for more reliable bias assessment.

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline for 3D CT-based Med-VLMs adapted for 3D MRI in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, using synthetic reports from metadata and auxiliary MMSE score prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Med-VLMs underutilize patient metadata, lack clinical diagnostic knowledge integration, require extensive computational resources, and have limited effectiveness on 3D medical imaging due to missing structural information.

Method: Proposes a pipeline with two innovations: 1) converting structured metadata into synthetic reports for better image-text alignment, and 2) adding an auxiliary token trained to predict MMSE scores for additional supervision. Uses lightweight prompt tuning on both image and text modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two Alzheimer's disease datasets using only 1,500 training images, outperforming methods fine-tuned on 10,000 images.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates data-efficient adaptation of 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI applications, effectively addressing limitations of existing models while requiring significantly fewer training resources.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: Self-supervised cross-encoder framework for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis from MRI that disentangles static anatomical features and dynamic temporal changes, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing deep learning methods that require large labeled datasets and produce uninterpretable representations for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis from MRI data.

Method: Propose a self-supervised cross-encoder framework leveraging temporal continuity in longitudinal MRI scans. Uses contrastive learning for static representations (stable anatomical features) and input-gradient regularization for dynamic representations (temporal changes), which can be fine-tuned for classification tasks.

Result: Achieves superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability on ADNI dataset. Demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on OASIS dataset and cross-task generalization on PPMI dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data labeling requirements and interpretability issues in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis, showing promising generalization capabilities across different datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models are robust against regeneration attacks but suffer from detection performance degradation due to loss of frequency integrity and vulnerability to cropping attacks.

Method: Develops Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW) that enforces Hermitian symmetry to maintain frequency integrity, and introduces center-aware embedding strategy to reduce vulnerability to cropping by ensuring robust information retention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification and identification performance across various attack scenarios, with highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior image fidelity (evidenced by FID and CLIP scores).

Conclusion: SFW is an effective framework for balancing robustness and image fidelity, successfully addressing inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking for latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework called TenRPCANet for small moving target detection that uses tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition with self-attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on infrared and space object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small moving target detection is crucial for defense applications but remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual cues, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing approaches lack robustness in complex environments as they rely on target-specific features or motion cues.

Method: Reformulates the task as tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition. Introduces TenRPCANet with tokenization strategy that enforces multi-order tensor low-rank priors through self-attention, capturing local and non-local self-similarity. Includes feature refinement module inspired by sparse component update in tensor RPCA.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared small target detection and space object detection.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates both effectiveness and generalizability, requiring minimal assumptions about target characteristics while leveraging inherent low-rank structures in cluttered backgrounds as stable priors for detection.

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: EDFFDNet is a novel deep image registration method that uses exponential-decay free-form deformation and adaptive sparse motion aggregation to handle scenes with depth disparities more efficiently and accurately than previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous deep image registration methods (single homography, multi-grid homography, thin-plate spline) struggle with real scenes containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations.

Method: Proposes EDFFDNet with exponential-decay basis function for free-form deformation, Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA) to replace MLP aggregators, and progressive correlation refinement strategy for coarse-to-fine motion estimation.

Result: Reduces parameters by 70.5%, memory by 32.6%, and total runtime by 33.7% while achieving 0.5 dB PSNR gain over state-of-the-art. EDFFDNet-2 variant improves PSNR by 1.06 dB with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and outperforms previous deep learning approaches, providing an efficient and accurate solution for image registration in scenes with depth disparities.

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for visual reasoning over tables are limited in scale, diversity, and reasoning depth, especially for rendered table images, creating a need for more comprehensive evaluation tools.

Method: Modular, scalable autonomous generation pipeline using multiple LLMs collaborating across generation, validation, and inspiration roles with cross-model prompting and LLM-jury filtering.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks and outperform several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature.

Conclusion: The Visual-TableQA dataset successfully addresses the gap in visual table reasoning benchmarks and demonstrates that synthetic data generation through multi-model collaboration can produce highly effective training resources.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

### [55] [Nearest Neighbor Projection Removal Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07673)
*Himanshu Singh,A. V. Subramanyam,Shivank Rajput,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel adversarial training framework that reduces inter-class feature overlap to improve robustness by projecting out inter-class dependencies from feature representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adversarial training fails to address inter-class feature overlap, which is a significant contributor to adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks.

Method: Identifies nearest inter-class neighbors for adversarial samples and removes their projections to enforce feature separability, with theoretical logits correction that reduces Lipschitz constant and Rademacher complexity.

Result: Strong competitive performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in both robust and clean accuracy compared to leading adversarial training techniques.

Conclusion: Explicitly addressing inter-class feature proximity is crucial for enhancing adversarial robustness in deep neural networks, and the proposed projection-based approach effectively achieves this goal.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

### [56] [Mini-o3: Scaling Up Reasoning Patterns and Interaction Turns for Visual Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07969)
*Xin Lai,Junyi Li,Wei Li,Tao Liu,Tianjian Li,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mini-o3 is a system that enables deep multi-turn reasoning for visual search tasks by scaling up tool-based interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance through diverse reasoning patterns and scalable inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source multimodal models exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and limited interaction turns, making them inadequate for difficult visual tasks requiring trial-and-error exploration.

Method: Three key components: 1) Visual Probe Dataset with challenging visual search problems, 2) Iterative data collection pipeline for diverse reasoning patterns, 3) Over-turn masking strategy to prevent penalization of long responses during reinforcement learning.

Result: The model generates trajectories scaling to tens of turns at inference time with improving accuracy, producing rich reasoning patterns and effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Conclusion: Mini-o3 demonstrates that scaling tool-based interactions enables deep multi-turn reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex visual search tasks through diverse exploration strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

*Sachit Menon,Ahmet Iscen,Arsha Nagrani,Tobias Weyand,Carl Vondrick,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video reasoning agent that uses LLMs to dynamically call video modules as tools, with a critic to evaluate success, achieving strong performance on complex video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video perception models perform well on short clips but struggle with complex reasoning on longer videos. The paper aims to leverage existing perception capabilities for more complex video reasoning tasks.

Method: Developed a large language model agent that uses video modules as subagents/tools, dynamically determining subsequent steps based on previous results. Introduced a critic to distinguish successful from unsuccessful reasoning sequences.

Result: The combination of agent and critic achieves strong performance on LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL datasets for complex video reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic tool usage with LLM agents and critics can effectively leverage existing video perception capabilities for complex video reasoning, overcoming limitations of fixed procedural approaches.

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

### [58] [SEEC: Segmentation-Assisted Multi-Entropy Models for Learned Lossless Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07704)
*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC proposes a segmentation-assisted multi-entropy model framework for lossless image compression that uses semantic segmentation to guide multiple specialized entropy models for different image regions, achieving state-of-the-art compression ratios with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learned image compression methods use a single entropy model for the entire image, which fails to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different semantic regions, limiting compression performance.

Method: The framework extracts image features, applies semantic segmentation to identify different regions, assigns specialized entropy models to each region, and uses multi-channel discrete logistic mixture likelihood to model pixel value distributions effectively.

Result: Experimental results show SEEC achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios on benchmark datasets with minimal encoding/decoding latency, and supports Regions of Interest coding based on segmentation masks.

Conclusion: SEEC demonstrates that using multiple entropy models guided by semantic segmentation significantly improves lossless image compression performance by better capturing region-specific statistical properties.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

*Christian Gapp,Elias Tappeiner,Martin Welk,Karl Fritscher,Stephanie Mangesius,Constantin Eisenschink,Philipp Deisl,Michael Knoflach,Astrid E. Grams,Elke R. Gizewski,Rainer Schubert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning approach combining 3D CTA imaging and clinical data to predict stroke recurrence risk, achieving AUC of 0.71 for relapse prediction and identifying heart diseases and carotid arteries as key predictive factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke has high mortality rates (5.5M annually) with 5-25% recurrence in first year and 40% mortality for relapses, making early detection of at-risk patients crucial for therapy planning.

Method: Collected 3D intracranial CTA images and clinical data (heart diseases, age, gender) from 2010-2024. Trained single- and multimodal deep learning networks for binary relapse detection (Task 1) and relapse-free survival time prediction with classification (Task 2).

Result: Tabular data achieved AUC 0.84 for binary relapse detection. Multimodal XSRD-net (vision:tabular 0.68:0.32 ratio) achieved c-index 0.68 and AUC 0.71 for relapse-free survival prediction. Identified heart diseases and carotid arteries as key predictive factors.

Conclusion: Multimodal approach effectively predicts stroke recurrence risk. Heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) are strongly linked to relapse detection and survival prediction, providing valuable insights for clinical intervention planning.

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

### [60] [HairGS: Hair Strand Reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07774)
*Yimin Pan,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for strand-level hair reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves efficient and topologically accurate hair modeling from multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human hair reconstruction is challenging but important for VR and digital human modeling. Existing methods focus on geometric quality but neglect strand connectivity and topology.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) Reconstruct detailed hair geometry using differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, 2) Merge Gaussian segments into coherent strands with novel merging scheme, 3) Refine and grow strands under photometric supervision.

Result: Method handles diverse hairstyles robustly and achieves efficient reconstruction (typically within 1 hour). Outperforms existing methods in topological accuracy with proposed evaluation metric.

Conclusion: The 3DGS framework extension enables strand-level hair reconstruction with improved topological accuracy and efficiency, advancing hair modeling for digital human applications.

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

*Hugo Blanc,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud,Alexis Paljic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayGaussX accelerates RayGauss for real-time novel-view synthesis by introducing volumetric rendering acceleration techniques, ray coherence enhancement, scale regularization, and improved densification, achieving 5-12x faster training and 50-80x higher FPS while improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but has high computational costs that prevent real-time rendering on real-world scenes, necessitating acceleration techniques.

Method: Builds on RayGauss with volumetric rendering acceleration (empty-space skipping, adaptive sampling), ray coherence enhancement, scale regularization to reduce false positives, and new densification criterion for better density distribution in distant regions.

Result: Achieves 5x to 12x faster training, 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on real-world datasets, and improves visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Conclusion: RayGaussX successfully accelerates RayGauss for real-time performance while maintaining and even improving rendering quality on real-world scenes.

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

*Maja Schlereth,Moritz Schillinger,Katharina Breininger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised neural network for fusing orthogonal anisotropic low-resolution MR images into high-resolution reconstructions without requiring high-resolution training data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 10x speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MR imaging requires balancing image quality with acquisition time and patient comfort. Current practice of analyzing individual low-resolution scans is time-consuming and can lead to inaccurate interpretations.

Method: Multi-view neural network trained in self-supervised manner using sparse coordinate-based loss to fuse two orthogonal anisotropic low-resolution MR images, combining patient-agnostic offline and patient-specific online phases.

Result: Achieves comparable or improved super-resolution performance compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for different upsampling scales, with 10x speed-up for patient-specific reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient high-quality MR image reconstruction from orthogonal low-resolution scans without requiring high-resolution training data, significantly improving both quality and speed in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

*Mahtab Dahaghin,Milind G. Padalkar,Matteo Toso,Alessio Del Bue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatFill is a novel depth-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting inpainting method that achieves state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency, using joint depth-based supervision and consistency-aware refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with inpainting missing regions, often producing blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent geometry, which needs to be addressed.

Method: Combines joint depth-based and object-based supervision for accurate Gaussian placement, plus consistency-aware refinement to selectively correct inconsistent regions without disrupting the scene.

Result: Surpasses existing NeRF-based and 3DGS-based methods in visual fidelity, reduces training time by 24.5%, and delivers sharper details with fewer artifacts across challenging viewpoints.

Conclusion: SplatFill provides an effective solution for high-quality 3DGS scene inpainting with both superior perceptual quality and improved efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

*Zhuoxu Huang,Mingqi Gao,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLM bridges the representation gap between LLMs and 3D point clouds using Object-centric Discriminative Representation and Geometric Reactivation Decoder, achieving significant improvements in 3D segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address representation misalignment between high-level semantic LLM tokens and dense geometric 3D point clouds, which limits input/output alignment and causes loss of fine-grained accuracy in prior methods.

Method: Introduces Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR) to learn object-centric tokens with hard negative-aware training, and Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD) to combine LLM-inferred geometry with dense features for mask prediction.

Result: Achieves +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks.

Conclusion: PLM demonstrates effective object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding by bridging the LLM-3D representation gap without requiring large-scale pre-alignment.

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

*Tiancheng Yang,Lin Zhang,Jiaye Lin,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-LEAF method dynamically detects and corrects hallucinations in MLLMs using layer-wise attention analysis, achieving 53% improvement in captioning and 4% gains in VQA with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations where generated text conflicts with visual input, and existing uniform attention adjustment methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers and heads.

Method: Introduces Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) to flag anomalous layers and Image Attention Focus (IAF) to score attention heads, then uses Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF) for dynamic error correction during inference.

Result: 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and approximately 4% improvement in both accuracy and F1-score on VQA tasks, while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-based diagnostics and D-LEAF method effectively suppress hallucinations in MLLMs by precisely localizing and correcting errors at specific layers and heads during inference.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Conclusion: Active MINT successfully contributes to AI model transparency and provides effective safeguards for security, privacy, and copyright protection through its novel multitask learning approach.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

### [68] [Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07917)
*Chunlin Wen,Yu Zhang,Jie Fan,Hongyuan Zhu,Xiu-Shen Wei,Yijun Wang,Zhiqiang Kou,Shuzhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCNet introduces object-level correlation for few-shot semantic segmentation, using general object mining and correlation modules to reduce background noise and improve novel object segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods build image-level correlations that contain hard pixel noise from irrelevant background objects, leading to background overfitting. Biological vision processes identify novel objects through object-level information, which is more effective in low-data regimes.

Method: Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) with General Object Mining Module (GOMM) that constructs query general object features using saliency and high-level similarity cues, and Correlation Construction Module (CCM) that establishes object-level correlation by matching target prototypes with general object features.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective mining of query target features and suppression of hard pixel noise.

Conclusion: Object-level correlation is more effective than image-level correlation for few-shot semantic segmentation, successfully addressing background overfitting issues and achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: ScoreHOI is a diffusion-based optimizer that uses diffusion priors and physical constraints to achieve precise human-object interaction reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous optimization methods struggle with physically plausible reconstruction results due to lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions.

Method: Uses diffusion priors and score-guided sampling to reconstruct conditional distribution of human and object pose. Incorporates physical constraints during denoising process and employs contact-driven iterative refinement for better contact plausibility.

Result: Extensive evaluations show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise and robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: ScoreHOI effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by leveraging diffusion priors and physical constraints, resulting in more accurate and physically plausible human-object interaction reconstruction.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

*Moo Hyun Son,Juyoung Bae,Zelin Qiu,Jiale Peng,Kai Xin Li,Yifan Lin,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToothMCL is a novel multimodal contrastive learning framework that integrates CBCT and IOS data for superior tooth segmentation performance, achieving 12% and 8% improvements in DSC scores respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tooth segmentation methods lack rigorous validation, demonstrate limited performance, and have poor clinical applicability. There's a need for more accurate and robust digital dentistry tools.

Method: ToothMCL uses multimodal contrastive learning to integrate volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS) modalities, capturing modality-invariant representations for precise multi-class segmentation and FDI tooth numbering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 12% improvement for CBCT segmentation and 8% for IOS segmentation in Dice Similarity Coefficient. Demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal pretraining framework represents a significant advancement in digital dentistry, enabling more accurate tooth segmentation and identification that can improve clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

*Mahmudul Islam Masum,Miad Islam,Arif I. Sarwat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the performance gap of object detectors on consumer hardware by identifying system-level bottlenecks and proposing a Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm that achieves 1.85x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical performance gap between benchmark results and practical viability of object detectors on consumer-grade hardware like laptops with RTX 4060 GPUs, where performance is dominated by system-level bottlenecks rather than compute limitations.

Method: Introduces a Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm that uses a fast low-resolution pass first, then escalates to high-resolution only when detection confidence is low. This model-independent approach requires no architectural changes and compares architectural early-exit with resolution-adaptive routing strategies.

Result: On a 5000-image COCO dataset, the method achieves 1.85x speedup over PyTorch Early-Exit baseline with only 5.51% mAP loss, demonstrating significant performance improvement on resource-constrained systems.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical blueprint for deploying real-time AI on consumer devices by shifting focus from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that maximize throughput through adaptive inference approaches.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

TL;DR: Evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms for tumbling satellites using Isaac Sim simulations, with Neuralangelo showing promising results on static scenes as baseline for dynamic scene analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects is crucial for On-Orbit Servicing and Active Debris Removal missions to assess geometry and motion properties of tumbling targets.

Method: Developed simulation environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of tumbling satellites under realistic orbital lighting conditions, evaluating state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms.

Result: Preliminary results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising reconstruction quality - generated 3D meshes closely match original CAD models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare.

Conclusion: The reconstructed models captured critical fine details for mission planning, providing a baseline for ongoing evaluation of dynamic scene reconstruction algorithms.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

*Kimiaki Shirahama,Miki Yanobu,Kaduki Yamashita,Miho Ohsaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a decoder using guided diffusion to generate images matching user-specified DNN features, enabling analysis of black-box feature spaces without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of DNN feature extraction by providing a way to visualize and understand what attributes are encoded in specific features.

Method: Uses a guided diffusion model that minimizes Euclidean distance between generated image features and target features during reverse image generation.

Result: Generated images have features remarkably similar to user-specified ones, providing valuable insights into DNN feature spaces of CLIP, ResNet-50, and vision transformers.

Conclusion: The decoder successfully enables feature space analysis across different DNNs without retraining, running efficiently on consumer GPUs.

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

*Zheng Geng,Nan Wang,Shaocong Xu,Chongjie Ye,Bohan Li,Zhaoxi Chen,Sida Peng,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen enables 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single reference image using coarse-to-fine alignment and text-guided domain randomization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and demonstrating real-world robotic grasping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating 6D pose for arbitrary unseen objects where 3D models are unavailable, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain gaps exist between synthetic and real images.

Method: A pipeline with two key components: 1) coarse-to-fine alignment module that jointly refines scale and pose using multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare refinement, and 2) text-guided generative domain randomization strategy to diversify textures for effective fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), far surpassing prior approaches, and demonstrates robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand.

Conclusion: The method enables high-fidelity single-view 3D generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation, validating practicality for real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL is a regularization method that aligns MLLMs' visual representations with pre-trained vision foundation models to preserve fine-grained visual details and improve performance on vision-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs underperform on vision-centric tasks like object counting and spatial reasoning due to text-only supervision that causes loss of fine-grained visual details during training.

Method: VIRAL (Visual Representation Alignment) - a regularization strategy that explicitly aligns internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models.

Result: Consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating key design choices.

Conclusion: This simple alignment approach opens an important direction for effective visual information integration in MLLM training.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Fermatean fuzzy-based optimization model for multi-criteria decision-making, specifically applied to renewable energy source selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in human judgments and handle complex decision-making scenarios, particularly for renewable energy selection which has critical environmental and policy implications.

Method: Uses Fermatean fuzzy environment (generalization of fuzzy sets) with an optimization model based on deviation maximization method to determine partially known feature weights, combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets.

Result: The method was successfully applied to renewable energy source selection problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling uncertainty and fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments.

Conclusion: The proposed Fermatean fuzzy-based approach provides an effective tool for complex multi-criteria decision-making under uncertainty, particularly valuable for renewable energy selection with both technical and policy considerations.

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

TL;DR: Spectral NSR is a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that uses graph spectral processing to embed logical rules as spectral templates, achieving superior accuracy, speed, and interpretability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of spectral learning, creating a more transparent and robust reasoning system.

Method: Embeds logical rules as spectral templates using graph signal processing and Laplacian eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, with extensions including dynamic graph learning, rational filters, mixture-of-spectral-experts, proof-guided training, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness, and higher interpretability on benchmarks like ProofWriter and CLUTRR compared to transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic programming systems.

Conclusion: Spectral NSR establishes a scalable and principled foundation for next-generation reasoning systems with transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions, and personalized workflows, requiring a more reliable approach.

Method: Leverages single expert demonstration to extract step-by-step instructions, executes strictly following user's intended trajectory, and uses verifier and backtracker modules for robustness against unexpected interruptions.

Result: Achieves 60% success rate on OSWorld tasks that all top-ranked agents failed to complete.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and extensible framework that bridges the gap between current GUI agents and reliable real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Result: Identified key challenges in each framework facet and established foundation for evaluating expressivity in solving diverse problems.

Conclusion: Aims to spark transformative action and encourage community to rethink neurosymphonic problem-solving approaches through better framework development.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this

### [81] [Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07146)
*Farnoush Baghestani,Jihye Moon,Youngsun Kong,Ki Chon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep learning-based denoising method using 1D convolutional autoencoder with LSTM bottleneck effectively removes EMG contamination from skin nerve activity (SKNA) measurements, enabling reliable sympathetic nervous system monitoring in movement-rich environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin nerve activity (SKNA) from ECG provides noninvasive SNS monitoring but is highly susceptible to EMG contamination during muscle activity, limiting its practical application in naturalistic settings.

Method: A lightweight 1D convolutional autoencoder with LSTM bottleneck was trained on simulated EMG-contaminated SKNA data using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, with realistic noise levels (-4 dB to -8 dB SNR).

Result: Method improved SNR by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross-correlation with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, restored burst features to near-clean discriminability (AUROC ≥ 0.96), and achieved 91-98% classification accuracy for baseline vs stress conditions.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based reconstruction effectively preserves physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during EMG interference, enabling robust SKNA monitoring in movement-rich natural environments.

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic.

Method: Two pipelines: (1) in-context learning with group self-evaluation (verbal-RL) using LLMs, and (2) chain-of-thought RL pipeline with OmniSQL-7B trained with special reward function and two-stage RL.

Result: Achieves SOTA on Spider, Spider 2.0, and BIRD benchmarks. 7.4% higher execution accuracy on Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark. Threefold gains for SQL dialects with limited training data.

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL delivers reliable, state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL performance under realistic industrial constraints.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present

two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

*Quinten Steenhuis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETCH classifier for legal issue classification using hybrid LLM/ML ensemble and automatic follow-up questions achieves 97.37% accuracy at lower cost than GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions seeking legal help face misdirection consequences like missed deadlines, physical abuse, housing loss, or child custody issues while waiting for proper legal assistance.

Method: Hybrid LLM/ML ensemble classification method with automatic generation of follow-up questions to enrich initial problem narratives, tested on 419 real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service.

Result: Achieved classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37% using inexpensive models, exceeding GPT-5 performance.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces cost while maintaining high accuracy in guiding legal system users to appropriate resources.

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

*Abdulhakim Alsaiari,Mohammad Ilyas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-LSTM intrusion detection system achieves 99.70% accuracy for smart grid cybersecurity against DNP3 and IEC104 protocol attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart grid evolution increases vulnerability to cyber attacks like unauthorized access and DoS, requiring robust intrusion detection for critical SCADA protocols.

Method: Combines CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for temporal pattern recognition to create hybrid deep learning IDS, trained on DNP3 and IEC104 datasets.

Result: Achieves 99.70% detection accuracy with significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to other deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM hybrid model provides highly effective cybersecurity protection for smart grid infrastructure against various cyber threats.

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.

TL;DR: SLMs can achieve LLM-level performance in healthcare prediction while being more efficient and privacy-preserving, though challenges remain with class imbalance and few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud-based LLMs raise privacy concerns and have high latency/memory usage for mobile healthcare. SLMs offer lightweight local deployment but their healthcare performance is unexplored.

Method: Systematically evaluated SLMs on health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, then deployed best models on mobile devices.

Result: SLMs achieved performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: SLMs are a promising solution for next-generation privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring, though current challenges remain with class imbalance and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

### [88] [Performative Thinking? The Brittle Correlation Between CoT Length and Problem Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07339)
*Vardhan Palod,Karthik Valmeekam,Kaya Stechly,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intermediate token generation (ITG/CoT) sequence length does not reliably correlate with problem difficulty, challenging the assumption that longer traces indicate adaptive thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine whether intermediate token sequence length reflects problem difficulty, as current assumptions anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking" and treat longer traces as evidence of higher problem-adaptive computation.

Method: Trained transformer models from scratch on derivational traces of A* search algorithm, using maze problems where operation count provides precise complexity measure. Evaluated on trivial free-space problems and systematically on out-of-distribution problems.

Result: Models produced excessively long reasoning traces even for simplest tasks, and intermediate token length only loosely correlated with ground truth A* trace length. Correlation appeared only when problems were closer to training distribution, suggesting approximate recall rather than genuine adaptive computation.

Conclusion: Intermediate trace generation is not adaptive to problem difficulty; longer sequences should not be automatically interpreted as "thinking effort" - computational complexity is not the significant factor, but rather distributional distance from training data.

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

TL;DR: SATLUTION is the first framework that extends LLM-based code evolution to full repository scale (hundreds of files, tens of thousands of lines of C/C++ code) for Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers, achieving performance surpassing human-designed competition winners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have shown coding abilities and AlphaEvolve demonstrated autonomous algorithm improvement, existing approaches were limited to isolated kernels. The motivation is to extend LLM-based code evolution to complete repository scale for complex NP-complete problems like SAT.

Method: SATLUTION orchestrates LLM agents to evolve solver repositories with strict correctness guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving its own evolution policies and rules.

Result: Starting from SAT Competition 2024 codebases, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed human-designed winners of SAT Competition 2025, and surpassed both 2024 and 2025 champions on 2024 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates that LLM-based code evolution can be scaled to full repository level for complex computational problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance that exceeds human expert capabilities in SAT solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

TL;DR: Language Self-Play (LSP) enables LLMs to improve performance through self-play reinforcement learning without additional training data, outperforming data-driven baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental bottleneck of LLMs requiring ever more training data by developing a method that allows models to improve without additional data.

Method: Game-theoretic self-play framework where models compete against themselves, treating capabilities as performance in competitive games to evolve stronger policies.

Result: Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct showed enhanced performance on instruction-following benchmarks through self-play alone, more effectively than data-driven approaches.

Conclusion: Self-play reinforcement learning provides a viable alternative to data scaling, enabling LLM improvement without dependency on additional training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SheetDesigner is a zero-shot framework using MLLMs for automated spreadsheet layout generation that combines rule and vision reflection, outperforming baselines by 22.6% while addressing the unique grid-based structure and semantics of spreadsheets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheets require manual layout design expertise, but existing automated layout models are ill-suited because they treat components as continuous rectangles and neglect spreadsheet-specific semantics like data dependencies and grid structure.

Method: SheetDesigner uses Multimodal Large Language Models with rule and vision reflection for component placement and content population. It formalizes spreadsheet layout generation with a 7-criterion evaluation protocol and uses a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets.

Result: SheetDesigner outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6%. Through vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with alignment, requiring hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates spreadsheet layout generation while addressing spreadsheet-specific challenges, with codes and data made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in system dynamics modeling improves scalability and predictive accuracy but loses explainability and causal reliability, which are critical for decision-making in transportation logistics.

Method: Hybrid approach integrating deep learning with concept-based interpretability, mechanistic interpretability, and causal machine learning to create neural network models with semantically meaningful variables while maintaining causal grounding.

Result: Framework enables construction of interpretable neural network models that retain transparency of traditional system dynamics models while leveraging deep learning advantages.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the gap between black-box predictive models and the need for explainable decision support in complex cyber-physical systems within industrial IoT environments.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Motivation: Address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box methods and poor transferability of black-box methods for Direct Prompt Injection attacks on LLMs.

Method: Construct Energy-based Model using surrogate model activations to evaluate adversarial prompt quality, then use token-level MCMC sampling to adaptively optimize prompts for gradient-free attacks.

Result: Achieved 49.6% attack success rate across five mainstream LLMs, 34.6% improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintained 36.6% ASR on unseen task scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong transferability and effectiveness, with interpretability analysis revealing correlation between activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting semantic patterns' role in vulnerability exploitation.

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

TL;DR: LLM ATLAS framework uses agency theory to address AI alignment problems in organizational LLM adoption by mitigating information asymmetries between adopters and black-box LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate harmful content due to misspecifications during adoption, and existing research doesn't address information asymmetries in organizational contexts.

Method: Conceptual literature analysis using organizational LLM adoption phases and agency theory as analytical concepts.

Result: Developed an extended literature analysis process for AI alignment methods and created the first LLM alignment problem-solution space.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS provides a theoretical framework to mitigate alignment issues during organizational LLM adoption through agency theory principles.

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog is a neurosymbolic AI framework that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates, enabling flexible multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning for graph-structured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed neural-then-symbolic flow, which restricts modeling complex dependencies in irregular data structures like graphs.

Method: Extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates, treats symbolic representations as graphs processable by GNNs, and allows arbitrary layering of neural and symbolic components.

Result: Effectively captures complex relational dependencies in planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN expressivity tasks.

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog overcomes key limitations of existing NeSy systems and broadens neurosymbolic AI applicability to graph-structured domains with a more expressive framework.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FTR framework combines user feedback with enhanced decoding to improve LLM self-correction, avoiding error propagation while enabling deeper reasoning through multipath exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect content during inference, and existing self-correction methods suffer from unreliable error localization signals and limited reasoning depth due to next-token decoding constraints.

Method: Proposes Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR) that only regenerates responses upon negative user feedback, and Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding for systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through delayed sequence evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Conclusion: The FTR framework effectively addresses limitations of current self-correction approaches by leveraging user feedback strategically and enabling deeper reasoning exploration, demonstrating superior performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

### [98] [RIMO: An Easy-to-Evaluate, Hard-to-Solve Olympiad Benchmark for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07711)
*Ziye Chen,Chengwei Qin,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIMO is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on International Mathematical Olympiad problems with two tracks: RIMO-N for integer-answer problems and RIMO-P for proof problems with automated grading, showing that current LLMs struggle significantly with Olympiad-level reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from grading noise and bias due to heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and reliance on potentially flawed solutions, necessitating a cleaner evaluation framework.

Method: Created two-track benchmark: RIMO-N with 335 IMO problems rewritten for single integer answers, and RIMO-P with 456 proof problems decomposed into sub-problems with expert-checked solutions and automated grading system.

Result: Benchmarking of ten frontier LLMs (including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash) shows sharp performance drop on RIMO compared to older benchmarks, revealing substantial gap in Olympiad-level reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RIMO provides a challenging yet easy-to-evaluate suite that serves as a high-resolution yardstick for future research, exposing a profound reasoning gap that needs to be addressed.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

### [99] [BDPM: A Machine Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut Microbiota Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07723)
*Bo Yu,Zhixiu Hua,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A machine learning framework called BDPM was developed for Parkinson's disease classification using gut microbiota data, featuring innovative feature selection and hybrid modeling to address limitations of single-classifier approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease has high misdiagnosis rates due to reliance on clinical scales, and while gut microbiota shows promise as a biomarker, existing deep learning approaches often use single classifiers and overlook microbial correlations and temporal dynamics.

Method: Collected gut microbiota profiles from 39 Parkinson's patients and healthy spouses, developed RFRE (Random Forest with Recursive Feature Elimination) for feature selection incorporating ecological knowledge, and designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and spatial patterns.

Result: The paper presents a novel feature extraction framework specifically tailored for microbiome data analysis in Parkinson's disease classification, though specific performance metrics are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The BDPM framework addresses critical limitations in current microbiome-based Parkinson's disease prediction by providing more robust feature extraction methods that consider ecological relationships and temporal dynamics in microbial data.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-powered chatbot using retrieval-augmented generation to estimate food carbon footprints through interactive LCA analysis


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address complexity of life cycle assessment for carbon footprint calculation in opaque global food supply chains with fragmented data

Method: Combines LCA advances and public databases with knowledge-augmented AI techniques including retrieval-augmented generation

Result: Interactive chatbot interface that estimates cradle-to-gate carbon footprints and relates results to familiar activities

Conclusion: Proof-of-concept demonstrates potential for accessible LCA insights but highlights limitations like database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

### [101] [Certainty-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dynamic Thinking Budget Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07820)
*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGR introduces a critic model that self-assesses reasoning confidence, enabling adaptive early termination when certain or continued reasoning when uncertain, improving accuracy while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning language models operate with fixed thinking budgets, but this approach lacks adaptability - it doesn't distinguish between problems that need extensive reasoning vs those that can be solved quickly with high confidence.

Method: Inspired by GANs' generator/discriminator framework, CGR uses a critic model that periodically probes its own reasoning to assess confidence. It continues reasoning until reaching a target certainty threshold, allowing early termination when confident.

Result: CGR improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage on AIME2024/2025 datasets. Multi-seed evaluations show reduced variance and improved exam performance. Token savings analysis shows millions of tokens saved with tunable certainty-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Certainty is a powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. CGR makes reasoning models more adaptive, trustworthy, and resource-efficient, enabling practical deployment where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

*Amay Jain,Liu Cui,Si Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparative study of vector-based vs graph-based RAG for educational QA, showing vector RAG is cost-effective for facts while graph RAG excels at thematic queries and corpus integrity, with dynamic routing recommended.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs like ChatGPT provide outdated/fabricated information in classrooms, requiring reliable RAG solutions that account for pedagogical factors and deployment costs.

Method: Used EduScopeQA dataset (3,176 questions across subjects) to evaluate OpenAI Vector Search RAG vs GraphRAG on educational query types and systematically altered textbooks.

Result: Vector RAG performs well as low-cost generalist for facts; GraphRAG Global excels at thematic queries; GraphRAG Local best with altered textbooks; dynamic routing framework boosts fidelity and efficiency.

Conclusion: Dynamic branching that routes queries to optimal retrieval method provides actionable guidelines for integrating RAG-augmented LLMs effectively into learning environments.

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

*Xinyu Zhang,Changzhi Zhou,Linmei Hu,Luhao Zhang,Xiancai Chen,Haomin Fu,Yang Yang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small-scale open-source LLMs can be enhanced to synthesize high-quality code instruction data through iterative self-distillation, reducing reliance on costly proprietary LLMs while achieving state-of-the-art code generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code LLMs rely on expensive instruction data from proprietary models, creating high costs. The paper explores using small-scale open-source LLMs as cost-effective alternatives for synthesizing high-quality code instruction data.

Method: Proposes iterative self-distillation approach with multi-checkpoint sampling, multi-aspect scoring for initial selection, and gradient-based influence estimation for final filtering. Uses enhanced small LLMs to synthesize code instruction data for fine-tuning.

Result: Developed SCoder models from DeepSeek-Coder that achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Small-scale LLMs can be transformed into powerful data synthesizers through iterative self-distillation, reducing dependency on proprietary models while maintaining high performance in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

*Augustin Crespin,Ioannis Kostis,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CP-Model-Zoo is a tutoring system that retrieves expert-written constraint programming models from a database based on natural language problem descriptions, eliminating the need for human data labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint programming modeling languages are complex with many global constraints, making it difficult for non-experts to create good models and choose CP for combinatorial problems.

Method: The system retrieves the closest source code model from a database of expert-written models based on a user's natural language problem description, using automated matching without human labeling.

Result: Experiments show excellent accuracy in retrieving correct models based on user-input descriptions simulated with different expertise levels.

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo effectively bridges the gap for non-experts by providing expert-validated models through natural language queries, making constraint programming more accessible.

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiPhO is the first benchmark for high school physics Olympiads that enables direct comparison between AI models and human contestants using official grading standards and medal thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics benchmarks lack systematic coverage of real-world physics competitions like Olympiads and don't allow direct performance comparison with human contestants.

Method: Compiled 13 latest Olympiad exams (2024-2025) with mixed modalities, adopted official marking schemes for fine-grained grading, and assigned medals based on official thresholds to compare models with human performance.

Result: Open-source MLLMs mostly remain at bronze level, open-source LLMs show occasional golds, closed-source reasoning MLLMs achieve 6-12 gold medals, but most models still have significant gap from full marks.

Conclusion: HiPhO reveals substantial performance gap between open-source models and top students, demonstrates strong physical reasoning of closed-source models, and shows significant room for improvement in multimodal physical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

### [106] [Probing the Preferences of a Language Model: Integrating Verbal and Behavioral Tests of AI Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07961)
*Valen Tagliabue,Leonard Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Experimental paradigms for measuring AI welfare through preference-behavior consistency tests in language models, showing feasibility but uncertainty about actual welfare measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop empirical methods for measuring welfare in language models by comparing stated preferences with behavioral choices in virtual environments.

Method: Compared verbal reports of preferences with behavior in virtual environment navigation and conversation topic selection. Tested effects of costs/rewards and consistency across semantically equivalent prompts using eudaimonic welfare scales.

Result: Found notable mutual support between measures - reliable correlations between stated preferences and behavior. Consistency varied across models and conditions, with responses not consistent across perturbations.

Conclusion: Preference satisfaction can serve as measurable welfare proxy in some AI systems, but uncertainty remains about actual welfare measurement due to model variability and fundamental questions about AI welfare subjecthood.

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION framework uses LLM-generated counterfactuals and targeted GNN training to reduce spurious correlations in vulnerability detection, achieving significant accuracy improvements from 51.8% to 97.8% on CWE-20 vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs for vulnerability detection suffer from training data imbalances and label noise, learning spurious correlations from superficial code similarities that fail to generalize to real-world data.

Method: Three-step framework: (i) generate counterfactuals using LLM prompting, (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels, (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify crucial code statements while ignoring spurious ones.

Result: Significant improvements: overall accuracy from 51.8% to 97.8%, pairwise contrast accuracy from 4.5% to 95.8%, worst-group accuracy from 0.7% to 85.5% on CWE-20 vulnerability. Created CWE-20-CFA benchmark with 27,556 functions.

Conclusion: VISION enables robust, generalizable vulnerability detection and advances transparent AI cybersecurity through interpretability and human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based framework for automated evaluation of topic models across four quality dimensions, outperforming traditional metrics in detecting semantic failures like redundancy and drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic model evaluation metrics (coherence, diversity) only capture statistical patterns and fail to identify semantic failures in practice, limiting their effectiveness for dynamic knowledge domains.

Method: Developed a purpose-oriented evaluation framework with nine LLM-based metrics spanning four dimensions: lexical validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and document-topic alignment soundness. Validated through adversarial and sampling-based protocols across multiple datasets and topic modeling methods.

Result: LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models (redundancy, semantic drift) that traditional metrics miss. Framework works across news articles, scholarly publications, and social media datasets.

Conclusion: Supports development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets, with all code and data publicly available.

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

Method: Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1-8B using Supervised Fine-Tuning on a curated energy corpus, with complete pipeline including data collection, model training, benchmark design, and evaluation.

Result: EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most energy-related language understanding and generation tasks on domain-specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized fine-tuning enables significant improvements in relevance and performance for technical fields like energy without large-scale infrastructure requirements.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

### [112] [DischargeSim: A Simulation Benchmark for Educational Doctor-Patient Communication at Discharge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07188)
*Zonghai Yao,Michael Sun,Won Seok Jang,Sunjae Kwon,Soie Kwon,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DischargeSim is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized discharge education through simulated doctor-patient conversations, revealing significant gaps in post-visit clinical education capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks focus on diagnostic reasoning but fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after medical visits through discharge communication and education.

Method: DischargeSim simulates multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with diverse psychosocial profiles across six clinical topics, evaluated through dialogue quality, personalized document generation, and patient comprehension tests.

Result: Experiments across 18 LLMs show significant gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across patient profiles and model size not always correlating with better outcomes.

Conclusion: DischargeSim provides the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in post-visit clinical education, highlighting the need for improved personalized patient support and equitable healthcare communication.

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [113] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A rule-based moral framework for handling uncertainty in LLM outputs using principles from moral psychology and virtue ethics, implemented in Prolog with clear rationales for different uncertainty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are used in high-stakes settings where probabilistic uncertainty methods are often opaque and misaligned with transparency expectations, creating technical and ethical challenges.

Method: Developed a framework based on moral principles (precaution, deference, responsibility) encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine that triggers system actions with plain-language rationales based on uncertainty levels (low, medium, high).

Result: Scenario-based simulations showed improved rule coverage, fairness, and trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains demonstrated enhanced trust and interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach provides a transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially responsible natural language generation, improving trust and interpretability through moral reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [114] [LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07274)
*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively automate complex annotation of (anti-)solidarity in German parliamentary debates about migration, revealing high postwar solidarity and rising anti-solidarity since 2015.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual annotation of political speech about migration is time-consuming and limits analysis scope. LLMs offer potential for automating complex annotation tasks to study migration debates more comprehensively.

Method: Extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs for annotating (anti-)solidarity subtypes in German parliamentary debates, comparing with thousands of human annotations. Examined model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical vs contemporary data, and systematic errors.

Result: LLMs showed promise for political text analysis. Data revealed high migrant-directed solidarity in postwar period and strong anti-solidarity trend in German parliament since 2015.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable tools for political text analysis, enabling deeper insights into migration debates. Findings highlight Germany's complex migration landscape with demographic decline and labor shortages alongside rising polarization.

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE introduces lookahead keys that update tokens' keys as context unfolds, enabling integration of future information while preserving autoregressive properties, with efficient parallel training and improved performance over standard causal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard causal attention has static QKV that only encode preceding context, limiting the model's ability to integrate information from tokens that appear later in the sequence.

Method: CASTLE continually updates each token's keys as context unfolds, creating lookahead keys that integrate information from later tokens while maintaining autoregressive property. A mathematical equivalence enables efficient parallel training without explicitly materializing lookahead keys.

Result: Consistently outperforms standard causal attention across model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on downstream tasks in language modeling benchmarks.

Conclusion: CASTLE provides an effective attention mechanism that allows tokens to integrate future context information while preserving autoregressive constraints, leading to better language modeling performance.

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BVM method tested for image state classification using language embeddings on MIT-States dataset, outperforms other metrics for noun classification but not better than logistic regression for adjective differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and test a new method (Basis Vectors Method) for judging state changes in images using language embeddings, and compare its performance against existing metrics.

Method: Used MIT-States dataset with 53,000 images, 225 nouns and 115 adjectives. Tested BVM against cosine similarity, dot product, product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and custom neural network for noun classification, and against logistic regression for adjective differentiation.

Result: BVM performed best among all metrics for classifying states for each noun class. For adjective differentiation, BVM did not perform better than logistic regression model, but potential improvements were identified.

Conclusion: BVM shows promise for noun state classification but requires methodological improvements to outperform existing approaches for adjective differentiation.

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

TL;DR: New benchmark for predicting instance-level performance of long-form generation tasks with fine-grained metrics, requiring both point estimates and uncertainty intervals using only black-box inputs/outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a task-, model- and metric-agnostic framework for predicting continuous evaluation metric scores in long-form generation tasks, addressing the need for performance prediction with minimal training data.

Method: Formulates a benchmark that predicts metric scores and uncertainty intervals using only black-box model inputs and outputs, evaluated across 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs and baselines.

Result: Shows that scores can be effectively predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training examples, demonstrating practical feasibility.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel and useful task, provides a valuable benchmark to drive progress, and offers baselines ready for practical adoption in performance prediction for long-form generation.

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [118] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAMIR is a novel data selection method that uses model's internal representations to identify training data based on familiarity, improving generalization with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT data selection methods are inefficient, costly, and sensitive to prompt variations. There's no clear methodology for effective training data selection, and simply increasing data volume doesn't guarantee performance improvements.

Method: KAMIR computes similarities between hidden states of each layer and final hidden states to assess data familiarity. It uses model's internal representations rather than prompt engineering, working with small datasets and simple classifiers.

Result: Experiments across diverse task datasets show that training with less familiar data leads to better generalization performance. The method can be applied to various tasks beyond multiple choice, including machine reading comprehension and summarization.

Conclusion: KAMIR provides an effective, cost-efficient approach to data selection for supervised fine-tuning by leveraging model's internal representations to identify valuable training data that improves generalization performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

*Nakyung Lee,Yeongoon Kim,Minhae Oh,Suhwan Kim,Jin Woo Koo,Hyewon Jo,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAOBP is a refinement framework that uses belief propagation to address attention localization in transformers, preventing entropy collapse and improving model performance, especially in small-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer self-attention often suffers from localization where attention collapses onto limited tokens and fails to capture long-range dependencies, limiting model effectiveness.

Method: Proposed Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP) that injects multi-hop relationships through belief propagation, and introduced Global Token Dependency (GTD) to quantify these interactions.

Result: SAOBP prevents entropy collapse in deeper layers, adaptively maintains GTD at appropriate levels, and shows competitive performance gains particularly in small-scale models.

Conclusion: SAOBP effectively addresses attention localization issues, improves inference quality, and shows strong potential for resource-constrained scenarios through better long-range dependency capture.

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse is a novel LLM post-training framework that enables language models to adapt and express different personalities for varying social contexts using a Mixture-of-Expert architecture with persona adapters and dynamic routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world conversations, particularly in adapting communication style and emotional expression to different social and task contexts.

Method: Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and Big Five personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture combining persona adapters with a dynamic routing network for contextual trait expression.

Result: Substantially outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional intelligence without sacrificing general reasoning ability or model safety. Achieves competitive response quality against leading LLMs despite smaller model size.

Conclusion: PersonaFuse offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking significant advancement toward more human-centric AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

TL;DR: LLM agents fail to acquire a new constructed language (Tinkatongue) through interactive conversation within 100 responses, but show human-like learning strategies, suggesting new evaluation benchmarks and model design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations focus on specific linguistic competencies but don't assess whether LLMs can acquire language through pattern recognition and interactive feedback like humans do.

Method: Proposed experimental framework where LLM agents attempt to acquire and use a newly constructed language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that only understands Tinkatongue.

Result: LLM agents failed to establish successful conversation within 100 responses, but demonstrated distinct strategies that mirror human language learning approaches.

Conclusion: Results indicate need for new evaluation benchmarks and suggest pathways for model designs that can learn more effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using lightweight exploration modules to help small language models better traverse knowledge graphs for improved question answering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-LLM integration methods rely on large proprietary models, limiting accessibility. Small language models struggle with KG traversal and reasoning, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Propose simple and efficient exploration modules that handle knowledge graph traversal instead of relying on the language model itself to perform this complex task.

Result: Lightweight modules effectively improve small language model performance on knowledge graph question answering tasks.

Conclusion: Lightweight exploration modules can successfully enhance small language models' KG reasoning capabilities, making KG integration more accessible and scalable.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

TL;DR: LongEmotion benchmark for long-context emotional intelligence tasks with 8,777 token average input length, featuring RAG and CoEM methods that outperform standard approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook emotional intelligence aspects in realistic long-context scenarios with lengthy, diverse, and noisy interactions.

Method: Developed LongEmotion benchmark with six EI tasks, implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (using conversation context and LLM itself) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (five-stage decomposition with retrieval and knowledge injection).

Result: Both RAG and CoEM methods consistently enhance EI performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs toward practical real-world EI applications.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address long-context EI challenges, with comparative studies showing performance differences among GPT models, providing a foundation for more realistic EI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

TL;DR: Multilingual XLM-RoBERTa-Large model achieves best performance for detecting positive, supportive online communication (candy speech) in German YouTube comments, outperforming other models with F1 scores of 0.8906 (binary) and 0.6307 (span-based).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of positive, supportive online communication (candy speech) remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact on fostering civility in social media.

Method: Used monolingual and multilingual language models (GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, XLM-RoBERTa) to detect candy speech in a 46k-comment German YouTube corpus, with span-level training approach.

Result: XLM-RoBERTa-Large ranked first in both binary positive detection (F1: 0.8906) and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) at GermEval 2025 Shared Task.

Conclusion: Multilingual models with span-based training and emoji-aware tokenizers are effective for identifying positive, supportive language, demonstrating the value of multilingual capabilities in candy speech detection.

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

TL;DR: Systematic review of stigmatizing language lexicons in healthcare reveals moderate similarity, mostly judgmental clinician terms, and predominantly negative sentiment, highlighting need for standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stigmatizing language contributes to healthcare inequities but there is no universally accepted lexicon defining what constitutes stigmatizing language in healthcare settings.

Method: Conducted systematic literature search to identify existing stigmatizing language lexicons, then performed comparative analysis of similarities/discrepancies and sentiment analysis using established sentiment dataset.

Result: Identified four lexicons showing moderate semantic similarity, with most stigmatizing terms being judgmental expressions by clinicians about perceived negative behaviors. Sentiment analysis revealed predominantly negative terms with variations across lexicons.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need for a standardized lexicon and highlight the challenges in defining stigmatizing language in clinical texts to address healthcare inequities.

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Result: Significant improvements in machine translation performance with minimum 25% increase in BLEU score across all six tested languages.

Conclusion: Data augmentation techniques show strong potential for improving machine translation systems for low-resource languages, contributing to more robust translation capabilities for under-resourced African languages.

Abstract: The linguistic diversity across the African continent presents different
challenges and opportunities for machine translation. This study explores the
effects of data augmentation techniques in improving translation systems in
low-resource African languages. We focus on two data augmentation techniques:
sentence concatenation with back translation and switch-out, applying them
across six African languages. Our experiments show significant improvements in
machine translation performance, with a minimum increase of 25\% in BLEU score
across all six languages.We provide a comprehensive analysis and highlight the
potential of these techniques to improve machine translation systems for
low-resource languages, contributing to the development of more robust
translation systems for under-resourced languages.

*Saumya Goswami,Siddharth Kurra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HALT-RAG is a post-hoc verification system that detects hallucinations in RAG outputs using NLI models and lexical features with a task-adapted meta-classifier, achieving strong performance on multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by source text in generative language models for safe deployment.

Method: Uses universal feature set from frozen NLI models and lexical signals to train a calibrated meta-classifier with 5-fold out-of-fold training protocol to prevent data leakage.

Result: Achieves strong OOF F1-scores: 0.7756 (summarization), 0.9786 (QA), 0.7391 (dialogue) on HaluEval benchmark with well-calibrated probabilities for abstention.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable tool for balancing model performance with safety requirements through practical abstention mechanism.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

*Zihan Chen,Lei Shi,Weize Wu,Qiji Zhou,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALLabel is a three-stage active learning framework that selects the most informative samples for LLM entity recognition, achieving comparable performance to full annotation with only 5-10% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning of LLMs for entity recognition in scientific domains is costly. There's a need for cost-effective methods that maintain high performance while reducing annotation requirements.

Method: A three-stage active learning framework that sequentially employs different strategies to select the most informative and representative samples for constructing demonstrations for LLM in-context learning.

Result: ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets. Achieves performance comparable to full dataset annotation with only 5-10% of annotated data.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective performance-cost trade-off, demonstrating that selective annotation through active learning strategies can significantly reduce costs while maintaining high entity recognition performance in scientific domains.

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

TL;DR: VeriOS-Agent is a trustworthy OS agent that autonomously handles normal GUI tasks while proactively querying humans in untrustworthy scenarios, improving success rates by 20.64% without compromising normal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OS agents are designed for idealized settings but real-world environments often present untrustworthy conditions, creating risks of over-execution that need mitigation.

Method: Proposes a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework and VeriOS-Agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that facilitates decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge for decision-making.

Result: VeriOS-Agent improves average step-wise success rate by 20.64% in untrustworthy scenarios over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining normal performance levels.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates rationality, generalizability, and scalability, providing a trustworthy solution for OS agents operating in real-world untrustworthy environments.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

### [130] [Avoiding Knowledge Edit Skipping in Multi-hop Question Answering with Guided Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07555)
*Yi Liu,Xiangrong Zhu,Xiangyu Liu,Wei Wei,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRAKE method addresses edit skipping in retrieval-augmented knowledge editing for multi-hop QA, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM knowledge becomes outdated quickly but retraining is costly. Existing RAG-based KE methods struggle with multi-hop QA due to edit skipping issues from language diversity and granularity mismatches.

Method: Proposes Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing (IRAKE) with guided decomposition using guidance from single edited facts and entire edited cases.

Result: Experimental results show IRAKE mitigates edit skipping failures and outperforms state-of-the-art KE methods for multi-hop question answering.

Conclusion: IRAKE effectively addresses the edit skipping problem in knowledge editing for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

*Andrey Sakhovskiy,Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BALI is a novel joint pre-training method that aligns language models with biomedical knowledge graphs to improve comprehension of complex domain-specific concepts and factual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical LLMs show limited understanding of complex domain-specific concept structures and factual information encoded in biomedical knowledge graphs, despite recent progress in biomedical text understanding.

Method: Proposes BALI - a joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments LMs with external knowledge by simultaneously learning a dedicated KG encoder and aligning representations of both LM and graph. Links biomedical concept mentions to UMLS KG and uses local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples.

Result: Implementation on leading biomedical LMs (PubMedBERT, BioLinkBERT) improves performance on language understanding tasks and entity representation quality, even with minimal pre-training on small alignment dataset from PubMed abstracts.

Conclusion: The BALI method successfully enhances biomedical language models by aligning them with knowledge graphs, demonstrating improved performance across various tasks with efficient training requirements.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

*Libo Ren,Yee Man Ng,Lifeng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an Iterative Self-Prompting technique using LLMs for clinical report summarization, achieving high semantic similarity scores despite lower lexical overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical reports are often lengthy and filled with jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to efficiently identify important information, which hinders effective patient-clinician communication in shared decision-making.

Method: Used Iterative Self-Prompting technique on LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-4o) with perspective-aware approach, generating task-specific prompts and refining them via example-based few-shot learning. Used ROUGE and BERT-score metrics to guide model fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P, R, F1) on 3,396 clinical case reports. High BERTscore indicates semantically equivalent summaries despite lower lexical overlap.

Conclusion: Perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be effectively deployed for clinical report summarization to support better communication between patients and clinicians, with models producing semantically accurate summaries even when exact word matching is lower.

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

*Xixi Wu,Yanchao Tan,Nan Hou,Ruiyang Zhang,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLoRAG is a logic-aware retrieval framework that combines semantic and logical relevance for multi-modal, multi-page document QA, outperforming traditional methods by capturing contextual relationships between pages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text conversion methods strip away multi-modal information like figures, while LVLMs have constrained input size limitations. RAG methods rely solely on semantic relevance, ignoring logical connections between pages essential for reasoning.

Method: Constructs a page graph capturing contextual relationships, uses lightweight VLM for graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages with logical connections, then feeds top-K pages to LVLMs for QA. Offers training-free and fine-tuned variants.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 9.68% in accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over baselines on four DocQA datasets.

Conclusion: MoLoRAG effectively addresses multi-modal, multi-page document understanding by combining semantic and logical relevance through page graph construction and traversal, significantly improving document QA performance.

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at
https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

### [134] [M-BRe: Discovering Training Samples for Relation Extraction from Unlabeled Texts with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07730)
*Zexuan Li,Hongliang Dai,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-BRe framework combines multi-class and binary classification approaches using three modules to efficiently extract high-quality training instances for relation extraction from unlabeled texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for relation extraction is expensive due to scarcity of relevant sentences. LLMs struggle with comprehensive relation semantics in multi-class classification and face computational overhead in binary classification.

Method: Proposes M-BRe framework with three modules: Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, and Label Decision to combine advantages of both multi-class and binary classification approaches.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled texts for relation extraction.

Conclusion: M-BRe effectively addresses LLM limitations in relation extraction by combining classification approaches to efficiently extract training instances from unlabeled data.

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

*Rochana Prih Hastuti,Rian Adam Rajagede,Mansour Al Ghanim,Mengxin Zheng,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Watermarking in medical LLMs compromises factual accuracy, requiring domain-specific evaluation and new approaches to preserve medical integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are adapted to sensitive medical domains, their fluency raises safety risks regarding provenance and accountability. Watermarking is used to mitigate these risks but its reliability in medical contexts remains untested, especially regarding factual accuracy under low-entropy settings.

Method: Proposed a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly assesses factual accuracy and coherence using GPT-Judger and human validation. Introduced Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS) as a composite metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence.

Result: Evaluation shows current watermarking methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts degrading medical entity representation. Watermarking's reweighting strategy creates factual risks in low-entropy settings.

Conclusion: Findings underscore the need for domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical content, requiring specialized evaluation metrics and methods for medical applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

TL;DR: Comprehensive benchmarking of Large Language Models for detecting fake news, harmful content, and political bias across 5 languages, showing that fine-tuning outperforms in-context learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of fake news, polarizing content, and harmful material on online platforms is a serious concern, but no proper benchmarking exists for LLM performance across different models, methods, and languages.

Method: Tested 10 datasets across 5 languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Bulgarian) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning and various in-context learning strategies including zero-shot, codebooks, few-shot (random and diverse selection), and Chain-of-Thought.

Result: In-context learning often underperforms compared to fine-tuning, even when using large models like LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning smaller models on task-specific settings is more effective than using large models with in-context learning approaches for content detection tasks.

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciNLP is a new benchmark dataset for full-text entity and relation extraction in NLP domain, comprising 60 annotated publications with 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations, enabling better knowledge graph construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for scientific information extraction focus on specific publication sections due to domain complexity and high annotation costs, limiting comprehensive analysis of full scientific texts.

Method: Created SciNLP dataset with 60 manually annotated full-text NLP publications, conducted comparative experiments with state-of-the-art supervised models, and implemented automatic knowledge graph construction using models trained on SciNLP.

Result: Results show varying extraction capabilities across different text lengths, significant performance improvements on certain baseline models, and successful construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph with average node degree of 3.2 per entity.

Conclusion: SciNLP is the first full-text annotation dataset for NLP domain entities and relations, providing rich semantic topological information that enhances downstream applications and is publicly available for research use.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

TL;DR: DK2R is a dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner that leverages both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge with LLMs to improve textual response generation in multimodal task-oriented dialog systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal task-oriented dialog systems neglect unstructured review knowledge and underutilize large language models (LLMs), limiting their response generation capabilities.

Method: Proposes DK2R which: 1) extracts both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge, 2) uses LLMs to evaluate knowledge utility via probe responses, 3) performs intention-oriented reasoning to generate key clues, and 4) enhances LLM-based response generation with auxiliary signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R over existing methods.

Conclusion: DK2R effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic knowledge selection and intention-response decoupling, demonstrating improved performance in multimodal dialog response generation through dual knowledge utilization with LLMs.

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF2 is a unified framework for English-Romanian literary translation that creates synthetic datasets and fine-tunes a 12B parameter open model, achieving results competitive with proprietary models while being more cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of rich, high-quality literary datasets for low-resource languages like Romanian and improve literary translation capabilities of small open models.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning process: (1) instruction tuning for genre-specific narrative style, (2) adapter compression for efficient deployment. Uses synthetic dataset generation and combines BLEU scores with LLM-based rubric evaluation.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with top-performing large proprietary models while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost-effective.

Conclusion: TF2 provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for cost-efficient translation and cross-lingual narrative generation, enabling broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

*Jiahui Li,Sean Papay,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Both humans and LLMs show sensitivity to prompt modifications, particularly label set and format changes, but humans are less affected by typos and reversed label order than LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether human annotators exhibit similar prompt brittleness as LLMs, and whether LLM prompt sensitivity should be considered problematic or if it correctly reflects human annotation variances.

Method: Systematically compare effects of prompt modifications on both humans and LLMs for text classification tasks using identical instruction variations.

Result: Both humans and LLMs show increased brittleness to specific prompt modifications like label set substitutions and format changes. Humans are less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order compared to LLMs.

Conclusion: Prompt brittleness is not unique to LLMs - humans also exhibit similar sensitivity patterns, though with some key differences in how they handle certain types of prompt perturbations.

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

*Chengyan Wu,Yiqiang Cai,Yufei Cheng,Yun Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs with LoRA for Chinese gender bias detection, using balanced data, majority voting, and multi-temperature sampling to achieve 47.90% average score in NLPCC-2025 Shared Task 7.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To promote fairness and controllability in natural language generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias in Chinese sentences.

Method: Fine-tuned large language models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), constructed balanced training sets with heterogeneous samples, employed majority voting from multiple expert models, and designed multi-temperature sampling for bias generation detection.

Result: Achieved an average score of 47.90% in the shared task, ranking fourth overall in performance.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effectiveness in Chinese gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation, showing promise for improving fairness in NLP systems.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

### [142] [Biased Tales: Cultural and Topic Bias in Generating Children's Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07908)
*Donya Rooein,Vilém Zouhar,Debora Nozza,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Biased Tales dataset reveals significant gender and cultural stereotypes in LLM-generated children's stories, with 55.26% more appearance-focused attributes for female protagonists and disproportionate emphasis on heritage themes for non-Western characters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about cultural and gender stereotypes in LLM-generated bedtime stories as parents increasingly rely on AI for children's storytelling, which shapes beliefs and morals.

Method: Created Biased Tales dataset to analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in LLM-generated stories, comparing gender and cultural representations.

Result: Found 55.26% increase in appearance-related attributes when protagonist is described as a girl vs boy. Non-Western children's stories disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes compared to Western stories.

Conclusion: Highlights the role of sociocultural bias in AI storytelling and emphasizes the need for making creative AI use more equitable and diverse to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes in children's narratives.

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

### [145] [Parallel-R1: Towards Parallel Thinking via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07980)
*Tong Zheng,Hongming Zhang,Wenhao Yu,Xiaoyang Wang,Xinyu Yang,Runpeng Dai,Rui Liu,Huiwen Bao,Chengsong Huang,Heng Huang,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs for parallel thinking using progressive curriculum learning, achieving significant accuracy improvements on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on supervised fine-tuning which encourages imitation rather than exploration and generalization for parallel thinking capabilities.

Method: Progressive curriculum: first use SFT on easier tasks to instill parallel thinking, then transition to RL for exploration and generalization on harder problems.

Result: 8.4% accuracy improvement over sequential thinking models on math benchmarks, with 42.9% improvement on AIME25 after RL training.

Conclusion: Parallel thinking serves as a mid-training exploration scaffold that unlocks higher performance ceilings, and the framework successfully instills parallel thinking behaviors in LLMs.

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

### [146] [Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06974)
*Xueyi Wang,Elisabeth Wilhelm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for sleep quality prediction that outperforms baseline methods and provides feature explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being, and there's a need for accessible, reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions using data from commercial wearable devices.

Method: Combines multi-scale convolutional layers for spatial interactions, recurrent layers and attention for temporal dependencies, and a two-stage domain adaptation strategy (training-time adaptation and source-free test-time adaptation) to enhance generalization to new users.

Result: Outperformed LSTM, Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet baselines across various window sizes. Best performance: 0.216 RMSE with 3-day input and 1-day prediction window. Maintained good performance (0.257 RMSE) for longer 3-day prediction horizons.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse wearable data, demonstrating practical utility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

*Yu Song,Zhigang Hua,Yan Xie,Jingzhe Liu,Bo Long,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSTBench is the first benchmark for evaluating cross-dataset transferability of graph self-supervised learning methods, revealing most SSL methods struggle to generalize while GraphMAE shows consistent improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most graph SSL methods are developed and evaluated on single datasets, leaving their cross-dataset transferability unexplored, which limits knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining capabilities needed for generalized graph intelligence.

Method: Conducted large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluated five representative SSL methods across diverse target graphs using standardized experimental setup that decouples confounding factors like model architecture and dataset characteristics.

Result: Most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize across datasets, with some performing worse than random initialization. GraphMAE (masked autoencoder approach) consistently improved transfer performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for future research on transferable graph SSL and lays a foundation for the "pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning, with GraphMAE showing promising transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

*Lingyu Zhang,Pengfei Xu,Guobin Wu,Jian Liang,Ruiyang Dong,Yunhai Wang,Xuan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided cross-modal model that integrates temporal traffic data with human knowledge text for improved traffic demand prediction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic prediction models rely mainly on temporal data but ignore valuable human knowledge and experience that could enhance prediction accuracy and robustness

Method: KGCM model combines structured temporal traffic data with textual human knowledge, uses local/global adaptive graph networks and cross-modal fusion, with reasoning-based dynamic parameter optimization

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple traffic datasets, accurately predicting future traffic demand

Conclusion: Integrating human knowledge with temporal data through cross-modal learning significantly improves traffic demand prediction performance

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring consistent deep learning model behavior across different hardware backends (CPU, GPU, compiled runtimes) where discrepancies and drift can occur, particularly important for dependable deployment in heterogeneous runtime environments.

Method: Decouples experiments from code using YAML configuration, supports both library and repository models, employs three-tier verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment, and task-level metrics. Uses deterministic adapters and selective fallbacks to improve agreement.

Result: Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance settings, 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring under stricter thresholds. Detection models and compiled backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic post-processing. Deterministic adapters and selective fallbacks substantially improve agreement without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: This is the first unified framework that systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning, providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across heterogeneous runtimes, with demonstrated effectiveness in improving backend compatibility.

*Wenxiong Li,Hanyu Liao,Suiyin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active learning Kriging-HDMR surrogate model for high-dimensional reliability analysis that overcomes curse of dimensionality through composite low-dimensional sub-models with optimized sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional surrogate models suffer from curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional reliability analysis, and existing HDMR approaches focus on optimization rather than reliability analysis which requires high accuracy in critical regions.

Method: Three-stage Kriging-HDMR framework: 1) single-variable sub-surrogate models, 2) identification of coupling-variable requirements, 3) construction of coupling-variable sub-models. Uses optimization models for sample selection incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, location and distances without candidate pool.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method achieves high computational efficiency while maintaining strong predictive accuracy for high-dimensional reliability problems.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning surrogate model effectively handles high-dimensional reliability analysis by decomposing complex functions into manageable low-dimensional components with optimized sampling strategy.

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

*Zirui Li,Bin Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NSATP method for public transport arrival time prediction that balances predictability and non-stationarity through two-stage approach: series stationarization and non-stationarity effect recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalization methods for handling non-stationary time series in arrival time prediction may obscure useful characteristics inherent in non-stationarity (over-stationarization problem), degrading model performance.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Series stationarization to improve predictability, 2) Non-stationarity effect recovery using 2D extension of state-of-the-art methods to capture hidden periodicity and compensation module learning scaling/shifting factors from raw data.

Result: NSATP reduces RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses respectively compared to baselines, using 125 days of Dresden public transport data.

Conclusion: The proposed NSATP method effectively balances predictability and non-stationarity in multi-step arrival time prediction, outperforming baseline methods while preserving useful non-stationary characteristics.

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Motivation: Large language models struggle with interactive tool use tasks due to tool heterogeneity, interface issues, and the need for stable multi-round interactions.

Method: Uses asyncio-based asynchronous caller, decoupled tool/training architecture, observation markers from tool feedback, and a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow with multiple reward signals (rule-based, model-judgment, tool-verification).

Result: Achieved 0.486 test score on Natural Questions dataset with Qwen3-4B, surpassing Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO (0.473), and increased training throughput by 6.8x.

Conclusion: RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable framework for strengthening multi-round tool use capabilities of LLMs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training
throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable

*Xiaomeng Hu,Fei Huang,Chenhan Yuan,Junyang Lin,Tsung-Yi Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARE is a novel decoding-time safety alignment framework that combines real-time safety monitoring, rollback mechanism, and introspection-based intervention to achieve better safety-quality trade-off for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding-time interventions often force a severe trade-off between safety and response quality in large language models, creating a need for better safety alignment approaches.

Method: Integrates three components: (1) guard model for real-time safety monitoring, (2) rollback mechanism with token buffer for early correction, and (3) introspection-based intervention where the model generates self-reflective critiques to guide subsequent decoding.

Result: Achieves superior balance of safety, quality, and efficiency with low harmful response rate and minimal disruption to user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Conclusion: CARE framework provides an effective solution for decoding-time safety alignment that overcomes the limitations of existing methods by enabling precise interventions, timely corrections, and effective self-correction.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

*Lishan Yang,Nam Kha Nguygen,Po Hu,Wei Emma Zhang,Yanjun Shu,Mong Yuan Sim,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FediLoRA is a federated learning framework that addresses heterogeneous client resources and missing modalities in multimodal fine-tuning using dimension-wise aggregation and layer-wise model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have deployment challenges due to large parameter sizes. Existing federated LoRA methods overlook heterogeneous client resources (different LoRA ranks) and multimodal settings with missing modalities.

Method: Proposes FediLoRA with dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without information dilution, and lightweight layer-wise model editing to selectively incorporate global parameters for local component repair.

Result: Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets show superior performance over competitive baselines in both global and personalized settings, especially with modality incompleteness.

Conclusion: FediLoRA effectively handles heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities in federated multimodal fine-tuning, achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

*Sima Najafzadehkhoei,George Vega Yon,Bernardo Modenesi,Derek S. Meyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using bidirectional LSTM to calibrate SIR epidemic models faster and more accurately than traditional Bayesian methods, achieving significant improvements in parameter estimation and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional calibration methods for agent-based epidemic models like Approximate Bayesian Computation are computationally demanding and time-consuming, creating a need for faster and more accurate calibration techniques.

Method: A three-layer bidirectional LSTM neural network that learns the inverse mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. It uses 60-day incidence data, population size, and recovery rate as inputs, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0. Training includes a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency penalty.

Result: The method achieved significantly lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs 0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produced tighter predictive intervals with near nominal coverage, and reduced wall clock time from 77.4s to 2.35s per calibration compared to ABC.

Conclusion: The supervised machine learning calibrator provides fast, practical, and accurate calibration of SIR epidemic models, faithfully reproducing epidemic curves while overcoming computational limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

*Xinquan Wu,Xuefeng Yan,Mingqiang Wei,Donghai Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a simple chronological DRL environment for Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem using discrete event simulation and PPO algorithm, with improved state representation and reward function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL methods for FJSP focus mainly on agent design while overlooking environment modeling, creating a need for better DRL environment frameworks.

Method: Developed a DRL environment based on discrete event simulation, used proximal policy optimization (PPO), created short state representation with two state variables, and designed a comprehensible reward function based on machine scheduling areas.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance of priority dispatching rules in the new environment, and the DRL model achieves competitive performance compared to OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL and PDR methods.

Conclusion: The proposed simple chronological DRL environment and end-to-end model effectively address FJSP scheduling with competitive results against established methods.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

TL;DR: A novel neural network architecture using single-bit parameters (0 or 1) that reduces memory usage by 32x while maintaining performance equivalent to 32-bit models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deployment challenges of large neural networks by reducing memory requirements and computational complexity to enable practical deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Developed binary normalized layers (fully connected, convolutional, attention) where all parameters including weights and biases are binary (0 or 1), applied to image classification and language modeling tasks.

Result: Binary normalized models achieved nearly identical performance to equivalent 32-bit models while using 32 times less memory, without requiring specialized hardware.

Conclusion: Binary normalized layers enable efficient deployment of large neural networks on simple hardware like mobile devices and CPUs, opening new possibilities for memory-efficient AI deployment.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A recursive extension to linear Probabilistic Adaptive Slow Feature Analysis (PASFA) is proposed for efficient MMSE estimation of slow features from ARMA process observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using Kalman filters after transforming ARMA to state space models cannot easily recover the original slow features that form useful representations for classification tasks.

Method: A recursive algorithm that performs minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of states evolving according to an ARMA process, given observations and the model.

Result: The proposed technique was evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness in inferring slow features from observations.

Conclusion: The recursive extension provides an efficient method for inferring slow features from ARMA process observations while preserving the original states that form useful representations for classification.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

### [159] [A Minimalist Bayesian Framework for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07030)
*Kaizheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A minimalist Bayesian framework that uses profile likelihood to eliminate nuisance parameters, enabling Thompson sampling and convex optimization with structural constraints while maintaining near-optimal regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian methods require probabilistic models for all parameters, which hinders incorporation of complex structural constraints in sequential decision-making problems.

Method: Introduces a minimalist Bayesian approach that places priors only on parameters of interest and eliminates nuisance parameters via profile likelihood. Develops MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS) algorithm that handles structured problems including continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing.

Result: The framework provides a probabilistic interpretation of classical convex optimization methods (center of gravity, ellipsoid) and achieves near-optimal regret guarantees for multi-armed bandits.

Conclusion: The minimalist Bayesian approach successfully bridges Bayesian decision theory with constrained optimization problems, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical applicability to structured decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combines causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting for macroeconomic analysis, revealing causal relationships and enabling accurate unemployment predictions with confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze dynamic causal relationships in key U.S. macroeconomic indicators and develop robust forecasting methods for economic policy decision-making.

Method: Applied LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) on quarterly data (1970-2021) for causal discovery, then used Chronos language model for zero-shot probabilistic forecasting of unemployment.

Result: Found unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP, limited connectivity of inflation, strong autoregressive dependence in unemployment. Achieved accurate 1-2 quarter ahead unemployment forecasts with 90% confidence intervals.

Conclusion: Combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models provides valuable insights for economic policy and enhances forecasting robustness through uncertainty-aware predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

TL;DR: This study compares CNN and vision transformer models for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI analysis to validate that models learn physically meaningful thermal features aligned with thermal physics principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interpretability barriers in AI deployment for PV monitoring by ensuring model decisions align with thermal physics principles, which is critical for adoption in energy infrastructure applications.

Method: Systematic comparison of CNN models (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) using XRAI saliency analysis on 20,000 infrared images across normal operation and 11 fault categories to assess physics alignment.

Result: Swin Transformer achieved highest performance (94% binary accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy). XRAI revealed models learn physically meaningful features matching expected thermal signatures. Performance varied significantly by fault type, with electrical faults detecting well (F1>0.90) but environmental factors like soiling remaining challenging (F1 0.20-0.33).

Conclusion: The thermal physics-guided interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI decision-making in energy monitoring, addressing deployment barriers in renewable energy infrastructure by demonstrating model decisions align with physical principles.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear layers dominate parameter count and computational cost in deep learning models, creating need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: Use trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions implemented as spline lookup tables to express high-dimensional mappings, replacing traditional linear layers.

Result: 6x FLOP reduction, 10x higher throughput on H100, 1.6-2.1x FLOP reduction in CNNs on CIFAR-10/ImageNet while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: lmKANs provide superior trade-off between capacity and inference cost, making them effective drop-in replacements for linear layers.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

TL;DR: GyroBN is a Riemannian batch normalization framework for gyrogroups that extends Euclidean normalization to non-Euclidean manifolds while maintaining theoretical control over sample statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean normalization layers are inadequate for data on manifolds, but many Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures that enable principled extensions to non-Euclidean domains.

Method: Introduces GyroBN with two key conditions (pseudo-reduction and gyroisometric gyrations) that guarantee theoretical control, and instantiates it on seven representative geometries including Grassmannian, constant curvature spaces, and correlation manifold.

Result: Experiments across multiple geometries demonstrate the effectiveness of GyroBN, and the framework incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods as special cases.

Conclusion: GyroBN provides a principled Riemannian batch normalization framework that works effectively across various non-Euclidean geometries while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

TL;DR: TabGFM reformulates graph node classification as a tabular problem, using tabular foundation models for zero-shot learning via table conversion and ensemble methods, achieving superior performance over traditional graph models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph foundation models are trained on datasets that poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting generalization. Tabular foundation models have shown strong cross-domain applicability, suggesting they could be effective for graph tasks when properly reformulated.

Method: Convert graphs into tables using feature and structural encoders, apply multiple tabular foundation models to diversely subsampled tables, and aggregate outputs through ensemble selection.

Result: Experiments on 28 real-world datasets show TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art graph foundation models.

Conclusion: Tabular reformulation presents a promising approach for scalable and generalizable graph learning, demonstrating the potential of tabular foundation models in graph domains.

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

TL;DR: Proposes EICS - a single-pass metric combining sheaf inconsistency and causal emergence to quantify when Transformer Circuits in LLMs are behaving coherently and trustworthy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of formal methods to quantify when active circuits in LLMs are behaving coherently and trustworthy, despite mechanistic interpretability identifying functional subgraphs.

Method: Specializes sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to Transformer Circuits, combining normalized sheaf inconsistency from local Jacobians/activations with Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence.

Result: Introduces Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS) - white-box, single-pass, dimensionless metric with practical guidance on interpretation and computation.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical framework for quantifying circuit coherence, with empirical validation on LLM tasks deferred for future work.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Motivation: To accelerate the slow and expensive trial-and-error process of materials discovery for applications like solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen-2.5 7B LLM with Wyckoff-based text representation and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) reinforcement learning to guide generation towards stable, novel structures with desired space group properties.

Result: Generates thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel structures at ~50% greater rate than prior methods, with ~115% improvement in unconditional generation and ~50% improvement in space group conditioned generation compared to fine-tuning alone.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of adapting NLP post-training techniques to materials design for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed-REACT is a federated learning framework that addresses data heterogeneity and evolution through representation learning and evolutionary clustering, achieving better performance than standard FL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in federated learning caused by heterogeneous and evolving client data distributions in real-world deployments.

Method: Two-stage process: (1) clients learn local models for feature representation extraction, (2) server dynamically clusters clients based on representations and coordinates cluster-wise training for downstream tasks.

Result: Theoretical analysis of representation learning stage and empirical demonstration of superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Fed-REACT effectively handles data heterogeneity and evolution in federated learning through its combined representation learning and evolutionary clustering approach.

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Motivation: Predicting drug efficacy prior to clinical testing has been challenging in pharmaceutical R&D, needing better methods to evaluate untested pharmaceuticals

Method: Train ML model using pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data (characteristics and outcomes), then analyze weighted impact scores of untested drugs across biological pathways to predict efficacy

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

### [169] [Explaining How Quantization Disparately Skews a Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07222)
*Abhimanyu Bellam,Jung-Eun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PTQ exacerbates disparate impacts on minority groups due to quantization effects on weights and activations, leading to reduced logit variance, increased loss, and compromised group accuracies. The paper proposes mixed precision QAT with dataset sampling and weighted loss to achieve fair quantized neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely used for compression but was observed to disproportionately harm minority group performance, creating fairness issues in quantized neural networks.

Method: Analyzed quantization's chain effects on forward/backward passes, studied impacts on gradient norms and Hessian eigenvalues, and proposed mixed precision Quantization Aware Training with dataset sampling and weighted loss functions.

Result: Quantization causes cascaded impacts leading to lower logit variance, increased loss, and compromised group accuracies, with verification through gradient norm and Hessian eigenvalue analysis.

Conclusion: Integrating mixed precision QAT with dataset sampling and weighted loss can mitigate disparate impacts, enabling fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IP-Basis PINNs is a meta-learning framework that enables efficient multi-query inverse problem solving by training a basis network offline and using only a lightweight linear layer online for rapid inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs are computationally expensive for multi-query inverse problems as each new observation requires full retraining. There's a need for efficient inference methods.

Method: Offline-online decomposition: train deep network offline to produce basis functions, then freeze it and train only linear output layer online for each new problem. Uses novel online loss, forward-mode AD, and validation mechanism.

Result: Demonstrated on three benchmarks including universal PINNs. Shows consistent performance across parameter types, significant speedup over standard PINNs, and robustness with scarce/noisy data.

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs provide an efficient framework for multi-query inverse problems with substantial computational savings while maintaining performance across various parameter estimation scenarios.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Method: Proposes Gradient Conductor (GCond) that builds on PCGrad with gradient accumulation and adaptive arbitration mechanism. Evaluated on self-supervised learning tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on ImageNet 1K and head/neck CT datasets.

Result: Stochastic mode achieved 2x computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality. Superior performance across all metrics with lower L1 and SSIM losses. High scalability demonstrated on both compact and large architectures, compatible with modern optimizers like AdamW and Lion/LARS.

Conclusion: GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to gradient conflicts in multi-task learning, making it applicable to modern large-scale models.

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

*Luke McLennan,Yi Wang,Ryan Farell,Minh Nguyen,Chandrajit Bajaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust unsupervised framework for learning generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy sparse phase-space data using variational Bayesian inference with physics-informed constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing distinctive motion dynamics and physics of various Hamiltonian systems (conservative, dissipative, port-Hamiltonian) from sparse observational data using a single model framework.

Method: Extends sparse symplectic random Fourier Gaussian processes with predictive successive numerical estimations of Hamiltonian landscape. Uses kernelized ELBO loss for data fidelity plus stability and conservation constraints as regularized loss terms to enforce physics correctness.

Result: The framework enables improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty for generalized Hamiltonian systems by incorporating physics-informed regularization.

Conclusion: The proposed variational Bayesian framework successfully learns various Hamiltonian dynamics from sparse noisy data while maintaining physics correctness through constrained optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptogram solving serves as an ideal testbed for studying neural network generalization in combinatorially complex domains with 26! possible mappings.

Method: Developed ALICE - an encoder-only Transformer with a novel bijective decoding head using Gumbel-Sinkhorn method to explicitly model permutations and enable direct cipher mapping extraction.

Result: ALICE generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on only ~1500 unique ciphers (3.7×10⁻²⁴ of possible space), achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. Early exit analysis reveals progressive refinement mirroring human strategies.

Conclusion: The architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure, offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. LLMs promise to reduce time and improve accuracy.

Method: Developed a hybrid approach combining human expert annotations with model consistency information. Created a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 NSCLC cases with expert annotations, used LLMs for proxy benchmark generation, and built an agent framework with meta-classifier for verification.

Result: Achieved strong correlation with expert benchmarks (Spearman r=0.88, RMSE=0.08) and high accuracy for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800). Demonstrated LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge for high-quality benchmark generation.

Conclusion: Established a clinically viable framework for LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balances accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing scalable automated clinical decision support.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

*Li-Chin Chen,Ji-Tian Sheu,Yuh-Jue Chuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model is proposed to learn better representations of age and gender from EHR data, showing improved performance across diverse healthcare datasets and disease types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demographic attributes like age and gender are crucial predictors in healthcare but are often treated as auxiliary features with limited attention to learning their optimal representations.

Method: The GDP model explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings, pre-trained on diverse datasets from different geographic regions.

Result: Sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and information gain, particularly in diseases where demographics are significant predictors. GDP enhances representational importance even when demographic attributes have low predictive value.

Conclusion: Foundational models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and populations, offering a promising approach to improve predictive performance in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedTeddi is a scheduling algorithm for federated edge learning that addresses dynamic data evolution by considering temporal drift and data divergence, achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world federated learning scenarios involve continuously evolving data with time-varying and non-iID characteristics, requiring adaptive model training under communication constraints.

Method: Proposes temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware scheduling using Earth Mover's Distance to quantify data dynamics, with joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation optimization.

Result: Achieves 58.4% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling, with higher test accuracy.

Conclusion: FedTeddi effectively handles dynamic data evolution in FEEL systems, enabling quick adaptation to new data while preserving previous knowledge under resource constraints.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

TL;DR: SBS enhances neural representation for neural networks by suppressing spectral bias through unidirectional ordering-based smoothing and adaptive random Fourier features, achieving better parameter compression and reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLPs in neural representation for neural networks suffer from spectral bias, limiting their ability to reconstruct high-frequency details in CNN weights effectively.

Method: Proposes two techniques: (1) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing to improve kernel smoothness, and (2) adaptive random Fourier features that modulate frequency bandwidth based on layer-wise parameter count.

Result: Extensive evaluations on ResNet models with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show significantly better reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SBS provides a parameter-efficient enhancement that effectively suppresses spectral bias in neural representations for neural networks, enabling superior compression and reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Motivation: Existing outlier-robust filters need improvement for handling correlated measurement noise and better outlier mitigation capabilities in general setups.

Method: Enhanced version of EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF) with additional learning feature that detects outliers and learns their characteristics during inference.

Conclusion: EMORF-II provides improved outlier-mitigation capability and is a useful choice for diverse applications due to its enhanced performance while maintaining practical computational complexity.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where
the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of

equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the

TL;DR: DPH-RL uses mass-covering f-divergences to preserve diversity during RL fine-tuning, solving Pass@k degradation while improving both single and multi-attempt performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR methods suffer from multi-attempt performance degradation and catastrophic forgetting despite improving single-attempt accuracy, due to inadequate divergence term design.

Method: Proposes DPH-RL framework using mass-covering f-divergences (forward-KL, JS-divergence) as rehearsal mechanism by continuously referencing initial policy to maintain solution diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation show DPH-RL resolves Pass@k degradation, improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k performance in- and out-of-domain, and is more training-efficient.

Conclusion: Proper divergence measure selection is crucial for RLVR improvement, and mass-covering f-divergences serve as powerful tools for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

*Antoine Ledent,Petr Kasalický,Rodrigo Alves,Hady W. Lauw*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for recommendation systems that jointly learns from explicit ratings and implicit feedback, providing separate predictions for consumption probability and rating likelihood with generalization bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve user modeling and recommendation by learning associations between interaction types, handling both explicit and implicit feedback simultaneously, and providing interpretable predictions for different rating probabilities.

Method: Convolutional AutoEncoder architecture that learns joint representations from explicit ratings and implicit sampling patterns, with separate prediction heads for consumption probability and rating likelihood.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks using a single model, with additional interpretability through individual rating probability predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully handles multiple interaction types, provides theoretical generalization bounds, and offers improved performance and interpretability for recommendation systems.

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

*Adithya Ramachandran,Thorkil Flensmark B. Neergaard,Tomás Arias-Vergara,Andreas Maier,Siming Bayer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel water demand forecasting method using unsupervised contrastive learning to categorize consumers by behavior patterns, then using wavelet-transformed convolutional networks with cross-attention for improved short-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing water resource security challenges due to climate change uncertainty, leveraging smart meter data to improve demand forecasting despite non-deterministic factors like weather conditions.

Method: Unsupervised contrastive learning for consumer categorization by consumption behavior, followed by wavelet-transformed convolutional networks with cross-attention mechanism combining historical data and behavioral representations.

Result: 4.9% maximum improvement in MAPE across different District Metered Areas over 6-month evaluation, plus identification of socioeconomic factors influencing consumer behavior.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves water demand forecasting accuracy and provides valuable insights into consumption patterns driven by socioeconomic factors, enhancing utility management capabilities.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

TL;DR: RoseCDL is a scalable and robust convolutional dictionary learning algorithm for unsupervised rare event detection in large signals, combining stochastic windowing for efficiency with inline outlier detection for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) is powerful for modeling local signal structures but hasn't been effectively used for rare event detection due to computational costs and sensitivity to artifacts/outliers.

Method: RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate anomalous patterns.

Result: The approach reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery and characterization, extending its capabilities beyond traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

Conclusion: RoseCDL provides a scalable and robust framework for unsupervised rare event detection in long signals, making CDL applicable to real-world signal analysis challenges.

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

*Zhiyuan He,Xufang Luo,Yike Zhang,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta L Normalization is a loss aggregation method that addresses high gradient variance from variable response lengths in RLVR training, providing unbiased estimates and minimizing variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR shows promise for improving LLM reasoning but suffers from unstable optimization due to large variability in response lengths during training, causing high gradient variance that existing methods don't adequately solve.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of length effects on policy loss, reformulating as minimum-variance unbiased estimator problem. Delta L Normalization provides unbiased policy loss estimates while minimizing gradient variance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent superior performance across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks compared to previous methods like GRPO, DAPO, and Dr. GRPO.

Conclusion: Delta L Normalization effectively solves the length variability problem in RLVR training, offering both theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements for stable optimization and better reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

*Zakeria Sharif Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: uGMM-NN is a novel neural network architecture that uses Gaussian mixture models in individual neurons instead of traditional weighted sums, enabling probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty modeling while maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks lack probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty modeling capabilities at the neuron level. The authors aim to integrate probabilistic reasoning directly into neural network computations to capture multimodality and uncertainty in individual neuron activations.

Method: Each neuron in uGMM-NN parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients, replacing traditional weighted sums and fixed nonlinearities.

Result: The uGMM-NN achieves competitive discriminative performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons while providing probabilistic interpretation of activations and uncertainty modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and generative modeling with built-in probabilistic reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

*Liya Gaynutdinova,Martin Doškář,Ondřej Rokoš,Ivana Pultarová*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual formulation for PINNs improves reliability in homogenizing periodic thermo-conductive composites with discontinuous coefficients by providing guaranteed error bounds and better failure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients like piecewise constant properties, lacking clear diagnostics for failure.

Method: Introduces dual formulation for PINN framework, compares standard PINNs with smoothed approximations vs variational PINNs (VPINNs) using spectral and neural network test functions.

Result: Strong-form PINNs may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings but are sensitive to material discontinuities. VPINNs handle piecewise constants directly but need careful test function selection. Dual formulation provides reliable convergence indicators.

Conclusion: Integration of dual formulation into PINN frameworks enhances applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics by providing robust error bounds and failure detection.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Conclusion: Attention-based deep learning enables proactive maintenance and optimized sensor configurations, enhancing operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

### [191] [Beyond Rebalancing: Benchmarking Binary Classifiers Under Class Imbalance Without Rebalancing Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07605)
*Ali Nawaz,Amir Ahmad,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluation of binary classifiers' performance under severe class imbalance without rebalancing techniques, showing that advanced models like TabPFN and boosting ensembles maintain better performance than traditional classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance is a major challenge in supervised classification, especially in critical domains like medical diagnostics, but most research focuses on rebalancing techniques rather than evaluating classifiers' native performance under imbalance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of diverse binary classifiers across real-world and synthetic datasets with progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and few-shot baselines. Includes experiments with synthetic decision boundaries, undersampling, oversampling, and one-class classification methods.

Result: Classification becomes more difficult as data complexity increases and minority class size decreases. Traditional classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, while advanced models like TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable guidance for model selection in imbalanced learning, demonstrating that certain advanced classifiers can maintain robustness without explicit rebalancing techniques, with implications for critical applications where minority classes are rare.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Integrated Gradients assumes continuous data and is ill-suited for discrete graph structures, creating a need for graph-specific explainability methods.

Method: Graph-based Integrated Gradients (GB-IG) extends the IG framework to handle graph data by adapting it to work with discrete graph structures.

Result: GB-IG accurately identifies crucial structural components in synthetic datasets and outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification on three real-world graph datasets.

Conclusion: GB-IG successfully addresses the limitations of IG for graph data, providing an effective explainability technique for graph neural networks.

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification

*Pierre Lambert,Edouard Couplet,Michel Verleysen,John Aldo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel acceleration method for neighbor embeddings that bridges the gap between coarse approximations (fast but low quality) and precise methods (slow but high quality), enabling interactive exploration with fine-grained structure preservation and no dimensionality restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neighbor embedding methods face a trade-off between speed and quality - coarse approximations like UMAP are fast but lack structure preservation, while precise methods like FIt-SNE are slow and limited to 2-3 dimensions for visualization only.

Method: Proposes a novel acceleration technique requiring few computations per iteration while maintaining structure quality, featuring a new iterative approximate nearest neighbor search approach and abandoning the traditional two-phase approach for instantaneous visual feedback.

Result: Experiments show promising results in speed and flexibility, with the method enabling interactive exploration and fine-grained control through hyperparameters without dimensionality limitations.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between speed and quality in neighbor embeddings, showing potential for broader machine learning applications beyond visualization with minimal algorithmic modifications.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBN proposes an interpretable bidirectional network with uncertainty-aware interpolation and Gaussian graph convolution for multivariate time series forecasting with missing variables, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like GinAR lack interpretability and fail to capture latent temporal patterns due to simple recursive units, while conventional spatial-temporal GNNs struggle with missing variables that hinder inter-variable correlation modeling.

Method: Integrates Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) with MC Dropout for uncertainty estimation and weighted mitigation of high-risk reconstructions, Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN) for explicit spatial correlation modeling, and bidirectional recursive units for enhanced temporal dependency modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios.

Conclusion: IBN provides a more reliable and interpretable framework for multivariate time series forecasting with missing variables, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using error-bounded lossy compression for non-activated experts in MoE models to reduce GPU memory transfer overhead, with analysis showing varying impact of compression errors across different model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently serving Mixture of Experts models under limited GPU memory constraints by reducing data transfer overhead when offloading non-activated experts to main memory.

Method: Employ error-bounded lossy compression algorithms (SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts and conduct extensive experiments to analyze how compression-induced errors affect inference accuracy across different expert layers.

Result: Shallow layer experts (attention and input transformation) show minimal accuracy degradation; middle-layer experts (model reasoning) suffer significant accuracy impairment; deep-layer experts (instruction following and output integration) sometimes show improved accuracy with bounded errors.

Conclusion: Error-bounded compression is effective for MoE model serving, with layer-specific sensitivity to compression errors - shallow layers are robust, middle layers are critical, and deep layers can potentially benefit from controlled compression errors.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Method: Proposes using inverse problems to efficiently discover scaling laws that guide LLM development, drawing inspiration from their success in scientific domains.

Result: Position paper advocating for a methodological shift from expensive trial-and-error to systematic inverse problem approaches for LLM scaling.

Conclusion: Inverse problems offer a promising approach to uncover scaling laws that can guide more cost-effective development of large language models with desirable performance characteristics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

### [198] [Predicting person-level injury severity using crash narratives: A balanced approach with roadway classification and natural language process techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07845)
*Mohammad Zana Majidi,Sajjad Karimi,Teng Wang,Robert Kluger,Reginald Souleyrette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining unstructured crash narratives with structured data using NLP techniques (TF-IDF and Word2Vec) significantly improves injury severity prediction accuracy compared to using structured data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance road safety and emergency response by leveraging both structured crash data and unstructured police narratives to better predict injury and fatality severity in traffic crashes.

Method: Used TF-IDF and Word2Vec NLP techniques on crash narratives, applied K-Nearest Neighbors oversampling for class imbalance, and developed 102 ML models combining structured and narrative features with XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost across three road classification schemes.

Result: Models incorporating narrative data consistently outperformed structured-data-only models. TF-IDF with XGBoost yielded the most accurate predictions across most subgroups.

Conclusion: Integrating textual and structured crash information provides a powerful framework for improving injury prediction, guiding policy decisions, and designing effective safety countermeasures.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

*Antoine de Mathelin,Christopher Tosh,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based strategy for selecting informative drug combinations in personalized oncology, using pretrained embeddings and dose importance scores to improve screening efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized combination therapy screening faces a cold-start problem with immense drug/dose combinations and limited experiments, requiring efficient initial selection without prior patient information.

Method: Leverages pretrained deep learning model on historical drug response data to generate drug combination embeddings and dose-level importance scores, combining clustering for functional diversity with dose-weighting for informativeness.

Result: Retrospective simulations on large-scale datasets show substantial improvement in initial screening efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Provides a viable path for more effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens by addressing the cold-start problem through principled experiment selection.

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

TL;DR: Multi-omics SVR model combining radiomics and dosiomics features predicts GTV changes in PULSAR radiotherapy with high accuracy (R²=0.743).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes has substantial prognostic value for personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR), which delivers radiation in pulses with protracted intervals.

Method: Developed a support vector regression (SVR) model using multi-omics features from 39 patients with 69 brain metastases. Used radiomics (MRI) and dosiomics (dose maps) features, computed delta features for relative changes, and implemented LASSO feature selection with cross-validation.

Result: Multi-omics models integrating radiomics, dosiomics, and delta features outperformed individual-omics models. The top model achieved R²=0.743 and RRMSE=0.022. Delta-radiomic features significantly enhanced prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The multi-omics SVR model shows promising performance for predicting continuous GTV changes, providing a quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and treatment adjustment in PULSAR radiotherapy.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-ear EEG signals can achieve 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection and 65.1% for four-class staging, offering a comfortable alternative to traditional scalp EEG for wearable sleep monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG sleep staging is accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep laboratories, limiting real-world applications like home monitoring and automatic media control when users fall asleep.

Method: Conducted sleep study with 11 participants using custom earpiece with dry eartip electrode in one ear and reference in the other, with ground truth from Apple Watch Ultra validated for sleep staging. Used leave-one-subject-out validation.

Result: Achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep).

Conclusion: In-ear electrodes show promise as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep monitoring with practical applications like automatically pausing media when users fall asleep.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel modular algorithm for Online Convex-Concave Optimization achieves minimax optimal dynamic duality gap bounds through adaptive components and multi-predictor aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal performance in Online Convex-Concave Optimization, particularly in stationary or predictable environments, requiring better methods to minimize the dynamic duality gap.

Method: Proposed modular algorithm with three components: Adaptive Module for dynamic adjustment to non-stationarity, Multi-Predictor Aggregator to identify best predictor, and Integration Module to combine their strengths.

Result: Achieves minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound (up to logarithmic factor) and ensures prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds. Empirical results demonstrate effectiveness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The modular design enables optimal performance in varying environments and allows seamless component replacement and integration of side knowledge from multiple predictors.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleZero extends UniZero with Mixture-of-Experts architecture and dynamic parameter scaling to handle large-scale heterogeneous multi-task learning, achieving performance comparable to specialized single-task models with 80% fewer environment steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-task world models struggle with gradient conflicts and loss of plasticity when scaling to large heterogeneous environments with diverse observation/action spaces and varying task difficulties.

Method: Proposes ScaleZero with MoE architecture to mitigate gradient conflicts, plus online LoRA-based dynamic parameter scaling that progressively integrates adapters based on task progress for adaptive knowledge retention.

Result: Achieves performance on par with specialized single-task baselines on Atari, DMControl, and Jericho benchmarks using only online RL with one model, requiring only 80% of single-task environment interaction steps.

Conclusion: ScaleZero demonstrates effective large-scale multi-task learning potential through architectural improvements and dynamic parameter management, enabling efficient heterogeneous task handling.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of multi-modal multi-task foundation models in education is hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data availability, requiring a privacy-preserving collaborative approach.

Method: Integration of federated learning with multi-modal multi-task foundation models to enable collaborative training across decentralized educational institutions while keeping sensitive data local.

Result: The paper proposes M3T FedFMs as a promising approach that advances privacy preservation, personalization, and equity/inclusivity in next-generation intelligent education systems.

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs represent an underexplored but promising paradigm for education, though several open research challenges need addressing including heterogeneous privacy regulations, data modality characteristics, unlearning approaches, continual learning frameworks, and model interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

TL;DR: ACE method addresses complete spurious correlations in neural networks using self-training with confident selective disagreement on unlabeled data, outperforming existing methods while remaining robust to incomplete correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are sensitive to spurious correlations that fail out-of-distribution. Existing work focuses on incomplete correlations, but complete spurious correlations create fundamental underspecification problems that need resolution.

Method: Proposes ACE method using self-training approach that encourages confident and selective disagreement. Learns concepts consistent with training data but making distinct predictions on novel unlabeled inputs.

Result: ACE matches or outperforms existing methods on complete-spurious correlation benchmarks while remaining robust to incomplete spurious correlations. Achieves competitive performance on language-model alignment without access to untrusted measurements.

Conclusion: ACE represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification in neural networks, though still subject to important limitations. The method is more configurable than prior approaches and allows principled unsupervised model selection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes new attention scoring functions using structured matrices (BTT and MLR) to address information loss in low-dimensional projections and lack of distance-dependent bias in standard attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention's low-dimensional projections cause information loss for high-dimensional inputs, and it lacks distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring tokens in sequences.

Method: Develops new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices.

Result: Outperforms standard attention on high-dimensional in-context regression tasks, achieves improved scaling laws in language modeling, and shows promising results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: BTT and MLR represent a broader family of efficient structured matrices that can encode full-rank or distance-dependent compute biases, addressing significant limitations of standard attention mechanisms.

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

TL;DR: Learning rate warmup accelerates gradient descent convergence under generalized smoothness assumptions, providing theoretical justification for this practical technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread practical success of learning rate warmup in training large neural networks, there has been a gap in theoretical understanding of why this strategy works.

Method: Proposed a novel family of generalized smoothness assumptions and analyzed convergence properties of gradient descent (both deterministic and stochastic) under these assumptions with warmup schedules.

Result: Learning rate warmup consistently accelerates GD convergence, with up to Θ(T) times faster convergence compared to non-increasing learning rate schedules in specific cases.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into the optimization benefits of learning rate warmup, bridging the gap between practice and theory for this widely used technique.

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

TL;DR: Using self-supervised learning to analyze ice crystal shapes from imagery to improve climate modeling


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ice-containing clouds significantly impact climate but are difficult to model due to the diverse shapes of ice crystals, requiring better characterization methods

Method: Self-supervised learning with vision transformers pre-trained on cloud particle images to learn robust latent representations of crystal morphology

Result: Successfully learned meaningful representations of ice crystal shapes and demonstrated application in quantifying ice crystal diversity

Conclusion: SSL-driven representations can improve ice crystal characterization and help constrain their role in Earth's climate system

Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due
to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning
(SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By
pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn
robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various
science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL
approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a
relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent
representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven
representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and
subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.

TL;DR: Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) method introduced for nuclear data adjustments in OECD benchmark, showing better performance than traditional methods for nonlinear applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess performance of nuclear data adjustment techniques for nonlinear applications and experiments with low correlation to applications, as proposed by OECD WPNCS benchmark exercise.

Method: Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) compared against traditional Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte Carlo Bayes (MOCABA) methods for nuclear data adjustments.

Result: IUQ showed agreement with GLLS and MOCABA for linear applications. For nonlinear applications, GLLS failed to replicate computed response distributions while MOCABA showed near agreement, and IUQ used computed model responses directly.

Conclusion: Bayesian IUQ shows potential for nuclear data adjustments, particularly for nonlinear applications. Experiments with low correlation can be informative, and specific properties were identified for selecting experiments in nuclear data adjustment.

Abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to
assess the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to
nonlinear applications and experiments with low correlation to applications.
This work introduces Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a
method for nuclear data adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the
more traditional methods of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte
Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS
and MOCABA for linear applications. When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ
posterior predictions to computed model responses using adjusted parameters, we
observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate computed response distributions
for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows near agreement, and IUQ uses
computed model responses directly. We also discuss observations on why
experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative to nuclear
data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark

### [212] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) improves retrieval by directly searching for documents that match reranker preferences using greedy graph search, achieving significant performance gains with limited computational budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional retrieve-and-rerank pipelines are limited by initial retrieval quality and the computational cost of LLM-based rerankers, which restricts the number of documents that can be processed.

Method: Uses greedy search on proximity graphs from approximate nearest neighbor algorithms to strategically prioritize promising documents for reranking based on document similarity, bypassing traditional sequential reranking.

Result: Achieved substantial improvements: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9 on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR benchmarks with a constrained reranker budget of only 100 documents.

Conclusion: Strategic document selection for reranking can significantly improve retrieval accuracy under limited computational budget when using fixed embedding and reranker models.

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

### [213] [Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07253)
*Julian Killingback,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for complex retrieval tasks and creates a diverse evaluation set to test state-of-the-art retrieval models, finding that even the best models struggle with complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval models need to handle complex natural language queries with multiple constraints, but existing evaluation sets focus on simple queries and lack realistic settings to assess true capabilities.

Method: Constructed a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmarked state-of-the-art retrieval models, while also exploring LLM-based query expansion and rewriting techniques.

Result: Best models achieved only 0.346 nDCG@10 and 0.587 R@100 across all tasks. LLM augmentation helped weaker models but decreased performance for the strongest model across all metrics.

Conclusion: Current retrieval models struggle significantly with complex retrieval tasks, and LLM-based query rewriting doesn't benefit the strongest models, highlighting the need for improved retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

### [214] [Datasets for Navigating Sensitive Topics in Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07269)
*Amelia Kovacs,Jerry Chee,Kimia Kazemian,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Two novel datasets combining user-content ratings with sensitivity labels from MovieLens/Does the Dog Die? and Archive of Our Own to evaluate personalized AI systems beyond engagement metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concern about adverse effects of personalized AI systems exposing users to sensitive/harmful content, requiring quantitative evaluation tools beyond engagement metrics.

Method: Created two datasets: 1) MovieLens ratings + Does the Dog Die? content warnings, 2) Archive of Our Own fan-fiction interactions + user-generated warnings with sensitivity taxonomy.

Result: Introduction of two comprehensive datasets with sensitivity labels alongside user-content ratings for evaluating personalized systems.

Conclusion: These datasets enable researchers to quantitatively assess personalized AI systems' impact on user well-being and exposure to sensitive material.

Abstract: Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our
Own.

### [215] [Avoiding Over-Personalization with Rule-Guided Knowledge Graph Adaptation for LLM Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07133)
*Fernando Spadea,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Lightweight neuro-symbolic framework that adapts user Knowledge Graphs at inference time to reduce over-personalization in LLM-based recommenders by suppressing biased feature patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate over-personalization and filter bubbles (Personalized Information Environments) in LLM-based recommender systems without retraining models or using opaque heuristics.

Method: Restructures user's Personalized Knowledge Graph to suppress biased feature co-occurrence patterns, uses symbolic adaptation strategies (soft reweighting, hard inversion, targeted removal), and client-side learning to optimize per-user application.

Result: Personalized PKG adaptations significantly increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality, outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods on recipe recommendation benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces filter bubbles by adapting user knowledge graphs at inference time, providing more diverse recommendations while preserving relevance through structured prompting.

Abstract: We present a lightweight neuro-symbolic framework to mitigate
over-personalization in LLM-based recommender systems by adapting user-side
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) at inference time. Instead of retraining models or
relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized
Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce
Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard
inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning
algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe
recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly
increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality,
outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.

### [216] [MEGG: Replay via Maximally Extreme GGscore in Incremental Learning for Neural Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07319)
*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Haimin Zhang,Li Wang,Yongze Wang,Qiang Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MEGG is an incremental learning framework for neural recommenders that uses GGscore metric to select influential samples for replay, preventing catastrophic forgetting in dynamic recommendation environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural collaborative filtering models struggle with evolving user preferences in dynamic environments due to static training assumptions. Existing incremental learning methods from other domains don't work well for recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and different task paradigms.

Method: Proposes MEGG framework with GGscore metric to quantify sample influence. Uses experience replay with selective replay of maximally influential samples. Model-agnostic approach that works across different architectures.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on three neural models and four benchmark datasets. Demonstrates strong scalability, efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: MEGG effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in neural recommenders through selective replay of influential samples, providing a generalizable solution for incremental learning in dynamic recommendation systems.

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

### [217] [FLeW: Facet-Level and Adaptive Weighted Representation Learning of Scientific Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07531)
*Zheng Dou,Deqing Wang,Fuzhen Zhuang,Jian Ren,Yanlin Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FLeW is a unified approach that combines contrastive training, fine-grained representation, and task-aware learning for scientific document embeddings, using citation intent signals and adaptive facet integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific document representation methods face limitations: contrastive training underutilizes citation information, fine-grained approaches lack domain generalization, and task-aware methods require manual task categorization and extra training data.

Method: Proposes FLeW with novel triplet sampling using citation intent and frequency, domain-generalized facet partition based on citation intents (background, method, result), and adaptive weight search to integrate facet-level embeddings without task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate FLeW's applicability and robustness across multiple scientific tasks and fields, outperforming prior models.

Conclusion: FLeW successfully unifies three representation learning approaches, providing better scientific document embeddings through enhanced citation signals and adaptive facet integration without requiring task-aware fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

TL;DR: IoT smart fridge system using ESP32-CAM and computer vision for food management, with improved object detection using focal loss and temperature scaling to handle overlapping items and poor lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in smart food management including waste reduction, inventory tracking, and consumption optimization, particularly overcoming issues with overlapping items, occluded views, and unreliable detection in multi-layered fridge setups.

Method: Three-module system: data pre-processing, object detection/management, and web visualization. Uses variant of focal loss with adaptive temperature scaling for error calibration in multi-category classification to mitigate overconfident predictions.

Result: Robust functional calibration significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions and scalability challenges, demonstrating practical improvements in food management efficiency.

Conclusion: The system provides a user-focused approach to modern food management that advances sustainable living goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption patterns.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Falcon3-Audio is a family of efficient audio-language models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on audio benchmarks using only 30K hours of public data, matching larger models while being more transparent and data-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs transforming NLP, audio integration remains underexplored despite audio's importance in human communication. The researchers aim to bridge this gap with efficient audio-language models.

Method: Built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders, using less than 30K hours of public audio data. Uses single-stage training without complex curriculum learning, multiple encoders, or intricate cross-attention connectors.

Result: Falcon3-Audio-7B matches best open-weight models on MMAU benchmark (score 64.14, matching R1-AQA). The 1B model remains competitive with larger 2B-13B models. Achieves strong performance despite using much less data than competitors (30K vs 500K+ hours).

Conclusion: Complex training methodologies are not necessary for strong audio-language model performance. The approach demonstrates superior data and parameter efficiency, transparency, and competitive results with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

*Yerin Ryu,Inseop Shin,Chanwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: First user-driven dynamics control method for singing voice synthesis using phoneme-level energy sequences, achieving 50%+ error reduction without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SVS systems rely on probabilistic modeling which limits precise control over musical attributes like dynamics (loudness variations), making user-driven expressiveness difficult to achieve.

Method: Explicitly condition SVS model on energy sequences extracted from ground-truth spectrograms, and propose phoneme-level energy sequences for user-friendly control to reduce annotation costs.

Result: Achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, while maintaining synthesis quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables precise user-driven dynamics control in singing voice synthesis with significantly improved accuracy and practical usability.

Abstract: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive
singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high
audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control
over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic
control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and
explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from
ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving
controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for
user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method
achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for
phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without
compromising synthesis quality.

*Kutub Uddin,Muhammad Umar Farooq,Awais Khan,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of state-of-the-art audio deepfake detection methods and their vulnerabilities to anti-forensic attacks that conceal generative AI signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of generative AI creates highly realistic deepfakes that threaten voice biometric applications, while existing detection methods are undermined by anti-forensic attacks that hide generative signatures.

Method: Extensive evaluation of SoTA audio deepfake detection methods on five benchmark datasets, comparing raw and spectrogram-based approaches under various anti-forensic attacks including statistical modifications and optimization-based attacks.

Result: The analysis reveals vulnerabilities of current ADD methods under adversarial conditions and provides insights into their effectiveness in exposing deepfake signatures.

Conclusion: This study highlights the need for more robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics and guides future research in developing adaptive defense strategies against evolving anti-forensic techniques.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Keyword spotting is essential for hands-free IoT devices but faces memory and energy constraints. Existing studies focus only on model inference, not the full processing pipeline.

Method: Systematic evaluation of lightweight neural networks (DS-CNN, LiCoNet, TENet) and proposed TKWS architecture. Full pipeline analysis from MFCC feature extraction to neural inference across three STM32 platforms (N6, H7, U5).

Result: TKWS with three residual blocks achieves 92.4% F1-score with 14.4k parameters. N6 MCU with neural acceleration shows best energy-delay product. Feature extraction parameters significantly impact real-world effectiveness.

Conclusion: Model accuracy alone doesn't determine real-world effectiveness. Optimal keyword spotting requires careful consideration of feature extraction parameters and hardware-specific optimization.

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key enabling technology for hands-free
interaction in embedded and IoT devices, where stringent memory and energy
constraints challenge the deployment of AI-enabeld devices. In this work, we
systematically evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art lightweight neural
network architectures, including DS-CNN, LiCoNet, and TENet, alongside our
proposed Typman-KWS (TKWS) architecture built upon MobileNet, specifically
designed for efficient KWS on microcontroller units (MCUs). Unlike prior
studies focused solely on model inference, our analysis encompasses the entire
processing pipeline, from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) feature
extraction to neural inference, and is benchmarked across three STM32 platforms
(N6, H7, and U5). Our results show that TKWS with three residual blocks
achieves up to 92.4% F1-score with only 14.4k parameters, reducing memory
footprint without compromising the accuracy. Moreover, the N6 MCU with
integrated neural acceleration achieves the best energy-delay product (EDP),
enabling efficient, low-latency operation even with high-resolution features.
Our findings highlight the model accuracy alone does not determine real-world
effectiveness; rather, optimal keyword spotting deployments require careful
consideration of feature extraction parameters and hardware-specific
optimization.

TL;DR: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs outperform other spectral/rhythm features for audio classification using deep CNNs on ESC-50 dataset


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and compare the performance of various spectral and rhythm features (mel-spectrograms, MFCCs, tempograms, chromagrams, etc.) for audio classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks

Method: Used a deep CNN with end-to-end deep learning pipeline on ESC-50 dataset (2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings), evaluating multiple spectral/rhythm features as input data

Result: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs performed significantly better than other features (cyclic tempograms, STFT chromagrams, CQT chromagrams, CENS chromagrams) across accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score metrics

Conclusion: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs are the most effective input features for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs, outperforming other spectral and rhythm features

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.

TL;DR: Neural network method to approximate black-box synthesizers by mapping presets to audio embeddings, enabling audio loss integration for automatic synthesizer programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for automatic synthesizer programming is challenging due to non-differentiable software synthesizers that can't be integrated into training pipelines.

Method: Train neural networks to map synthesizer presets to audio embedding space from pretrained models, creating neural proxies that produce compact representations for black-box synthesizers.

Result: Evaluated various pretrained audio models and neural architectures (feedforward, recurrent, transformer) on three software synthesizers, showing encouraging results in sound matching tasks.

Conclusion: Method enables integration of audio embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems, paving way for future research despite nuanced resource requirements.

Abstract: Deep learning appears as an appealing solution for Automatic Synthesizer
Programming (ASP), which aims to assist musicians and sound designers in
programming sound synthesizers. However, integrating software synthesizers into
training pipelines is challenging due to their potential non-differentiability.
This work tackles this challenge by introducing a method to approximate
arbitrary synthesizers. Specifically, we train a neural network to map
synthesizer presets onto an audio embedding space derived from a pretrained
model. This facilitates the definition of a neural proxy that produces compact
yet effective representations, thereby enabling the integration of audio
embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems for black-box synthesizers. We
evaluate the representations derived by various pretrained audio models in the
context of neural-based nASP and assess the effectiveness of several neural
network architectures, including feedforward, recurrent, and transformer-based
models, in defining neural proxies. We evaluate the proposed method using both
synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three popular software synthesizers and
assess its performance in a synthesizer sound matching downstream task. While
the benefits of the learned representation are nuanced by resource
requirements, encouraging results were obtained for all synthesizers, paving
the way for future research into the application of synthesizer proxies for
neural-based ASP systems.

*Kamel Kamel,Hridoy Sankar Dutta,Keshav Sood,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SMIA attack manipulates inaudible frequencies in AI-generated audio to bypass voice authentication systems, achieving 82-100% success rates against current security measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice authentication systems are vulnerable to sophisticated threats like deepfakes and adversarial attacks, with existing countermeasures being static and easily bypassed by novel methods.

Method: Proposed Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA) that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated audio to create adversarial samples that sound authentic but deceive countermeasures.

Result: SMIA achieved 82% ASR against combined VAS/CM systems, 97.5% against standalone speaker verification, and 100% against countermeasures, demonstrating current security is insufficient.

Conclusion: Urgent need for paradigm shift toward dynamic, context-aware defense frameworks that can evolve with the threat landscape, as current static detection models are vulnerable to adaptive adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for
verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such
as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they
face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and
adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates
detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.
While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many
rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial
methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we
propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method
that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated
audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA
creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.
SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against
combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification
systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively
demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive
adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift
toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks
capable of evolving with the threat landscape.

Method: Stated preference experiment with nationally representative UK sample (n=300) using Expected Utility Maximisation framework, testing sensitivity to probability weighting from Cumulative Prospect Theory.

Result: Majority showed concave utility curves, stronger aversion to societal inequality than personal risk, with preferences unrelated to political alignment - suggesting shared normative stance on fairness.

Conclusion: Challenges use of average life satisfaction as policy metric, supports development of nonlinear utility-based alternatives that better reflect collective human values for policy and AI systems.

Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are
people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate
these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally
representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life
satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of
uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an
Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the
overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect
Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse)
utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life
satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated
to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in
well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use
of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of
nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective
human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the
design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.

*Laura Boggia,Bogdan Malaescu*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: Using synthetic data from Lorenzetti Simulator to evaluate transformer-based and deep learning models for multivariate time series anomaly detection in physics experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial for physics experiment data quality, but challenging due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations.

Method: Generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter anomalies using Lorenzetti Simulator, then evaluate sensitivity of transformer-based and other deep learning anomaly detection methods.

Result: The approach is generic and applicable to different detector designs and defects, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation provides a viable solution to address label scarcity and unreliability in multivariate time series anomaly detection for physics experiments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to ensure the
quality of data coming from a physics experiment. Accurately identifying the
moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging
due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across
dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use
the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter
anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly
detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models.
The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector
designs and defects.

*Zichun Hao,Raghav Kansal,Abhijith Gandrakota,Chang Sun,Ngadiuba Jennifer,Javier Duarte,Maria Spiropulu*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: RINO is a self-supervised learning method that pretrains models directly on collision data using renormalization group invariance, improving generalization from simulation to real data in high energy physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ML in HEP relies on simulations that often mismatch real collision data, causing domain shift problems that reduce model robustness.

Method: Pretrain transformer-based model on QCD jets from JetClass dataset (real data emulation) using renormalization group scale invariance, then finetune on JetNet dataset (simulation emulation) for top quark jet identification.

Result: RINO shows improved generalization from JetNet training data to JetClass data compared to supervised training from scratch on JetNet.

Conclusion: RINO pretraining on real collision data followed by fine-tuning on small MC datasets can improve ML model robustness in HEP applications.

Abstract: A common challenge with supervised machine learning (ML) in high energy
physics (HEP) is the reliance on simulations for labeled data, which can often
mismodel the underlying collision or detector response. To help mitigate this
problem of domain shift, we propose RINO (Renormalization Group Invariance with
No Labels), a self-supervised learning approach that can instead pretrain
models directly on collision data, learning embeddings invariant to
renormalization group flow scales. In this work, we pretrain a
transformer-based model on jets originating from quantum chromodynamic (QCD)
interactions from the JetClass dataset, emulating real QCD-dominated
experimental data, and then finetune on the JetNet dataset -- emulating
simulations -- for the task of identifying jets originating from top quark
decays. RINO demonstrates improved generalization from the JetNet training data
to JetClass data compared to supervised training on JetNet from scratch,
demonstrating the potential for RINO pretraining on real collision data
followed by fine-tuning on small, high-quality MC datasets, to improve the
robustness of ML models in HEP.

*Yadi Cao,Futian Zhang,Wesley Liu,Tom Neiser,Orso Meneghini,Lawson Fuller,Sterling Smith,Raffi Nazikian,Brian Sammuli,Rose Yu*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: TGLF-SINN is a neural network surrogate that accelerates turbulent transport predictions in tokamaks with reduced data requirements through feature engineering, physics-guided regularization, and Bayesian active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole device simulations requiring thousands of TGLF evaluations are computationally expensive, and traditional NN surrogates need large training datasets that are costly to obtain from gyrokinetic simulations.

Method: Proposes TGLF-SINN with three innovations: principled feature engineering to reduce prediction range, physics-guided regularization of transport spectra, and Bayesian Active Learning for strategic training sample selection.

Result: Achieves 12.4% reduction in LRMSE compared to baseline, uses only 25% of dataset with BAL while maintaining accuracy, and provides 45x speedup over TGLF in flux matching applications.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for training efficient surrogates for higher-fidelity models where data acquisition is costly and sparse, enabling faster whole device simulations with comparable accuracy.

Abstract: The Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) model provides fast, accurate
predictions of turbulent transport in tokamaks, but whole device simulations
requiring thousands of evaluations remain computationally expensive. Neural
network (NN) surrogates offer accelerated inference with fully differentiable
approximations that enable gradient-based coupling but typically require large
training datasets to capture transport flux variations across plasma
conditions, creating significant training burden and limiting applicability to
expensive gyrokinetic simulations. We propose \textbf{TGLF-SINN
(Spectra-Informed Neural Network)} with three key innovations: (1) principled
feature engineering that reduces target prediction range, simplifying the
learning task; (2) physics-guided regularization of transport spectra to
improve generalization under sparse data; and (3) Bayesian Active Learning
(BAL) to strategically select training samples based on model uncertainty,
reducing data requirements while maintaining accuracy. Our approach achieves
superior performance with significantly less training data. In offline
settings, TGLF-SINN reduces logarithmic root mean squared error (LRMSE) by 12.
4\% compared to the current baseline \base. Using only 25\% of the complete
dataset with BAL, we achieve LRMSE only 0.0165 higher than \base~and 0.0248
higher than our offline model (0.0583). In downstream flux matching
applications, our NN surrogate provides 45x speedup over TGLF while maintaining
comparable accuracy, demonstrating potential for training efficient surrogates
for higher-fidelity models where data acquisition is costly and sparse.

### [230] [DepthVision: Robust Vision-Language Understanding through GAN-Based LiDAR-to-RGB Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07463)
*Sven Kirchner,Nils Purschke,Ross Greer,Alois C. Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DepthVision is a multimodal framework that synthesizes RGB images from LiDAR point clouds using a conditional GAN, then blends them with real RGB data using luminance-aware adaptation to improve robot vision in degraded conditions without fine-tuning VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or insufficient, particularly in low-light conditions, darkness, or motion blur scenarios.

Method: Uses conditional GAN with refiner network to synthesize RGB images from sparse LiDAR point clouds, then combines with real RGB data using Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation (LAMA) that dynamically blends data based on ambient lighting conditions.

Result: Improves performance in low-light conditions, achieves substantial gains over RGB-only baselines, maintains compatibility with frozen vision-language models, and demonstrates effectiveness on both real and simulated datasets for safety-critical tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot operation in real-world environments, compensating for sensor degradation without requiring downstream model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

### [231] [Can SSD-Mamba2 Unlock Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Motion Control?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07593)
*Gavin Tao,Yinuo Wang,Jinzhao Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SSD-Mamba2-based vision-driven RL framework for motion control that achieves superior performance with near-linear scaling, overcoming limitations of recurrent controllers and Transformer-based fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or use fusion backbones with poor compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, while Transformers have quadratic costs limiting temporal/spatial context.

Method: Uses SSD-Mamba2 selective state-space backbone that enables both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming. Encodes proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations into compact tokens fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. Trained end-to-end with curricula randomizing terrain/appearance and increasing scene complexity.

Result: Consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions/falls), and sample efficiency. Achieves faster convergence at same compute budget with lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention.

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion control, enabling longer look-ahead and higher token resolution with stable training under limited compute.

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

*Harrison Field,Max Yang,Yijiong Lin,Efi Psomopoulou,David Barton,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Text2Touch uses LLMs to automate reward design for dexterous manipulation with tactile sensing, outperforming human-engineered baselines in multi-axis object rotation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on LLM-automated reward design for dexterous manipulation has overlooked tactile sensing, which is crucial for human-like dexterity. The authors aim to bridge this gap by incorporating real-world vision-based tactile sensing.

Method: The approach involves prompt engineering that scales to over 70 environment variables, using LLM-crafted rewards for multi-axis in-hand object rotation. Sim-to-real distillation enables policy transfer to a tactile-enabled four-fingered dexterous robot hand in both palm-up and palm-down configurations.

Result: Text2Touch significantly outperforms carefully tuned human-engineered baselines, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability. The LLM-designed rewards are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler than human-engineered ones.

Conclusion: LLM-designed rewards can dramatically reduce the development time from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, enabling more rapid and scalable multimodal robot learning with tactile sensing integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and
scalable multimodal robot learning. Project website:

### [233] [RaC: Robot Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks by Scaling Recovery and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07953)
*Zheyuan Hu,Robyn Wu,Naveen Enock,Jasmine Li,Riya Kadakia,Zackory Erickson,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RaC introduces human-in-the-loop correction training after imitation learning, enabling robots to learn recovery behaviors and significantly improve performance on complex tasks with 10x less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot imitation learning plateaus on contact-rich and long-horizon tasks due to inefficient human teleoperation data collection, requiring a better approach to teach recovery and correction behaviors.

Method: Fine-tune robotic policies on human intervention trajectories where operators intervene during failures, rewind to familiar states, and provide corrective segments to complete sub-tasks.

Result: RaC outperforms state-of-the-art methods across bimanual control tasks (shirt hanging, lid sealing, box packing) and simulated assembly with 10x less data collection time and samples.

Conclusion: Training on human correction data enables robots to learn retry and adaptation behaviors, boosting efficiency and robustness while enabling test-time performance scaling with recovery maneuvers.

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

### [234] [A transformer-based generative model for planetary systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07226)
*Yann Alibert,Jeanne Davoult,Sara Marques*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: A transformer-based generative model is developed to efficiently create synthetic planetary systems that capture correlations between planets, enabling low-cost generation of systems for guiding exoplanet observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical planetary formation simulations are computationally expensive, but synthetic systems can reveal correlations between planet properties that could guide observational campaigns to discover Earth-like planets.

Method: Developed a generative model based on transformer architecture to capture correlations in planetary systems, trained on the Bern model, with validation through visual/statistical comparisons and ML-driven tests.

Result: Generated systems show very similar properties to those computed by the Bern model, and the model successfully predicted properties of unobserved planets in the TOI-469 system based on known planet data.

Conclusion: The transformer-based generative model provides an efficient way to generate realistic planetary systems with minimal computational cost, enabling better guidance for exoplanet discovery campaigns.

Abstract: Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in
terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide
access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between
the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,
be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at
discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to
develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and
statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,
trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of
synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,
for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on
the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture
correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language
Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and
statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,
as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at
predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties
of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different
comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are
very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We
also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model
allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the
properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the
community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.

### [235] [Association of Timing and Duration of Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity with Cognitive Function and Brain Aging: A Population-Based Study Using the UK Biobank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06969)
*Wasif Khan,Lin Gu,Noah Hammarlund,Lei Xing,Joshua K. Wong,Ruogu Fang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with better cognitive function and preserved brain structure in older adults, with benefits seen across all times of day but particularly midday-afternoon and evening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MVPA intensity and timing are associated with cognitive function and region-specific brain structure in older adults, as this relationship remains poorly understood despite physical activity being a modifiable lifestyle factor for cognitive resilience.

Method: Analyzed data from 45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60+ with accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural MRI. Used multivariable linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health covariates to evaluate associations between MVPA (measured continuously and categorically) and cognitive performance/brain volumes.

Result: Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across all cognitive domains (reasoning, memory, executive function, processing speed) and with larger volumes in subcortical brain regions and gray matter areas involved in emotion, working memory, and perceptual processing. Benefits were strongest in those meeting WHO guidelines and during midday-afternoon/evening activity.

Conclusion: MVPA is associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits (projected USD 760 billion annually by 2050).

Abstract: Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor with potential to support
cognitive resilience. However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and
region-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from
45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn
accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was
measured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using
>=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive
performance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable
linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related
covariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup
effects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive
domains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed.
These associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among
participants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with
subcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as
regional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and
perceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day
was associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the
midday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings
across subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is
associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in
later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy
cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits, with global gains
projected to reach USD 760 billion annually by 2050.

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of how neuron model selection (LIF, metaneurons, LB neurons) and learning rules (STDP, tempotron, reward-modulated) impact SNN classification performance in bio-signal processing, using novel Lempel-Ziv Complexity evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different biologically inspired neuron models and learning rules affect classification performance in Spiking Neural Networks for bio-signal processing applications.

Method: Compared LIF, metaneurons, and probabilistic Levy-Baxter neurons across multiple learning rules (STDP, tempotron, reward-modulated). Used Lempel-Ziv Complexity to quantify structural regularity of spike trains and evaluate classification outcomes. Employed synthetic datasets with Markov and Poisson processes to investigate neural dynamics.

Result: Classification accuracy depends on interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule. LZC-based evaluation identified configurations robust to weak/noisy signals. Clear performance trends revealed with synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data.

Conclusion: Provides systematic analysis of neuron model selection interaction with network parameters and learning strategies, supported by novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers consistent benchmark for SNN performance.

Abstract: This study explores how the selection of neuron models and learning rules
impacts the classification performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with
a focus on applications in bio-signal processing. We compare biologically
inspired neuron models, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), metaneurons,
and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neurons, across multiple learning rules,
including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), tempotron, and
reward-modulated updates. A novel element of this work is the integration of a
complexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using
Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the
structural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a
consistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To
investigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed
synthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels.
These included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to
simulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of
biological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data
reveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the
interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the
LZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or
noisy signals. This work delivers a systematic analysis of how neuron model
selection interacts with network parameters and learning strategies, supported
by a novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers a consistent
benchmark for SNN performance.

Motivation: To develop a comprehensive approach for building artificial intelligence systems that model human psyche by considering needs, meanings, and decision-making processes.

Method: Proposes a cognitive architecture concept where psyche is an operating system with needs space and intelligence as decision-making system. Provides computational formalization for AI systems learning from experience in needs space, considering biological/existential significance.

Result: Formalizes the problem of building general artificial intelligence as optimal decision-making in agent-specific needs space under uncertainty, with goals of maximizing success, minimizing existential risks, and maximizing energy efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed cognitive architecture and computational formalization provide a framework for developing artificial intelligence systems that can learn from experience while considering fundamental needs and existential priorities, with experimental implementation demonstrating feasibility.

Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche
in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a
concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered
as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of
needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the
external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in
relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a
computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence
systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs,
taking into account their biological or existential significance for an
intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial
intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of
agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with
maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks
and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of
the model is also provided.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning MRI reconstruction enables 4x acceleration with preserved diagnostic quality, reducing scan time by 75% while maintaining image quality comparable to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for faster MRI scanning times while maintaining diagnostic image quality, as traditional MRI scans are time-consuming and can limit patient throughput.

Method: Used DeepFoqus-Accelerate algorithm to reconstruct phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences from both healthy volunteers and public datasets with pathologies. Compared AI reconstructions with standard-of-care using qualitative assessment by neuroradiologists and quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, HaarPSI).

Result: No AI-reconstructed scan scored below minimally acceptable (3/5), 95% scored ≥4/5. High quantitative similarity: mean SSIM 0.95±0.03, PSNR >41.0 dB, HaarPSI >0.94. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation.

Conclusion: DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time while preserving diagnostic image quality and improving workflow efficiency.

Abstract: This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based
MRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans
accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.
The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January
2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse
pathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were
reconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care
(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists
independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets
using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for
408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity
Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally
acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases
>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to
moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These
findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain
MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image
quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

TL;DR: Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer (PGDiT) for dMRI angular super-resolution that combines q-space geometry modeling with physical constraints to reconstruct high-quality HAR signals from limited LAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dMRI angular super-resolution methods fail to recover fine-grained angular details and preserve high fidelity due to inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient physical constraints.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Training with Q-space Geometry-Aware Module (QGAM) using b-vector modulation and random angular masking for direction-aware learning; 2) Inference with Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior Sampling and heat-diffusion-based regularization for physically plausible reconstructions.

Result: PGDiT outperforms existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity on general ASR tasks and downstream applications (DTI and NODDI).

Conclusion: PGDiT provides a novel generative ASR framework that enables high-fidelity HAR dMRI reconstructions without prolonging scan time, with potential applications in neuroscience and clinical research.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct
high-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR)
data without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in
recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to
inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of
physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion
Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both
training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module
(QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates
direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate
directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse
and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior
Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by
heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible
reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates
oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or
generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two
downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation
Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms
existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our
approach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity
HAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and
clinical research.

*Diego Fajardo-Rojas,Levente Baljer,Jordina Aviles Verdera,Megan Hall,Daniel Cromb,Mary A. Rutherford,Lisa Story,Emma C. Robinson,Jana Hutter*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PUUMA - a dual-branch deep learning model using T2* fetal MRI to predict gestational age at birth, achieving comparable accuracy to clinical cervical length measurements for preterm birth detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preterm birth causes significant childhood mortality and morbidity, but current clinical predictors are limited due to complex multifactorial origins, requiring better prediction methods.

Method: Developed PUUMA dual-branch deep learning architecture using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies, integrating global whole-uterus and local placental features, benchmarked against linear regression with cervical length measurements.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error of 3 weeks for GA prediction and 0.67 sensitivity for preterm detection, comparable to cervical length regression despite class imbalance.

Conclusion: Proof of concept for automated GA prediction from functional MRI, demonstrating value of whole-uterus imaging and manual cervical length measurements from MRI for identifying at-risk pregnancies.

Abstract: Preterm birth is a major cause of mortality and lifelong morbidity in
childhood. Its complex and multifactorial origins limit the effectiveness of
current clinical predictors and impede optimal care. In this study, a
dual-branch deep learning architecture (PUUMA) was developed to predict
gestational age (GA) at birth using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies,
encompassing a heterogeneous and imbalanced population. The model integrates
both global whole-uterus and local placental features. Its performance was
benchmarked against linear regression using cervical length measurements
obtained by experienced clinicians from anatomical MRI and other Deep Learning
architectures. The GA at birth predictions were assessed using mean absolute
error. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess preterm
classification. Both the fully automated MRI-based pipeline and the cervical
length regression achieved comparable mean absolute errors (3 weeks) and good
sensitivity (0.67) for detecting preterm birth, despite pronounced class
imbalance in the dataset. These results provide a proof of concept for
automated prediction of GA at birth from functional MRI, and underscore the
value of whole-uterus functional imaging in identifying at-risk pregnancies.
Additionally, we demonstrate that manual, high-definition cervical length
measurements derived from MRI, not currently routine in clinical practice,
offer valuable predictive information. Future work will focus on expanding the
cohort size and incorporating additional organ-specific imaging to improve
generalisability and predictive performance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation in OCT images, achieving high accuracy with visual explanations using Grad-CAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual retinal layer segmentation in OCT is time-consuming and variable, while conventional deep learning models lack interpretability needed for clinical validation and trust.

Method: Modified SegNet architecture with improved pooling strategies, hybrid loss function (categorical cross-entropy + Dice loss), and integrated Grad-CAM for visual explanations.

Result: Achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and Jaccard Index of 0.8951 on Duke OCT dataset, with robust performance across most retinal layers.

Conclusion: The framework bridges accuracy and interpretability, offering strong potential for standardizing OCT analysis and enhancing clinical trust in AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

*Patricia Hu,Silvan David Peter,Jan Schlüter,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper adapts state-of-the-art online piano transcription models for real-time applications requiring latencies below 30ms by eliminating non-causal processing, reducing computational load, and exploring preprocessing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30ms, but existing piano transcription approaches either target offline applications or online transcription with delays of 128-320ms, which are insufficient for real-time use.

Method: The authors eliminate all non-causal processing, reduce computational load through shared computations across model components and model size variations, and explore different pre- and postprocessing strategies with related label encoding schemes.

Result: Evaluation on the MAESTRO dataset shows a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing, and reveals a tradeoff between preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The system is released as a baseline to support researchers in designing models for minimum latency real-time piano transcription, demonstrating the feasibility and challenges of achieving sub-30ms latency.

Abstract: Advances in neural network design and the availability of large-scale labeled
datasets have driven major improvements in piano transcription. Existing
approaches target either offline applications, with no restrictions on
computational demands, or online transcription, with delays of 128-320 ms.
However, most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30 ms. In
this work, we investigate whether and how the current state-of-the-art online
transcription model can be adapted for real-time piano transcription.
Specifically, we eliminate all non-causal processing, and reduce computational
load through shared computations across core model components and variations in
model size. Additionally, we explore different pre- and postprocessing
strategies, and related label encoding schemes, and discuss their suitability
for real-time transcription. Evaluating the adaptions on the MAESTRO dataset,
we find a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing as
well as a tradeoff between the preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy.
We release our system as a baseline to support researchers in designing models
towards minimum latency real-time transcription.

### [243] [Private Queries with Sigma-Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07018)
*Jun Gao,Jie Ding*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Sigma-counting method uses sigma-algebra to create privacy-preserving counting queries that improve accuracy while maintaining privacy with massive queries, addressing limitations of traditional noisy counting approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional noisy counting approaches risk leaking sensitive information, are limited in query numbers and accuracy, and don't maintain total order for nested queries which is important for many applications.

Method: Uses sigma-algebra concept to construct privacy-preserving counting queries, allowing for improved output accuracy while maintaining desired privacy levels even with massive queries to the same data.

Result: Significantly improves output accuracy while maintaining privacy in the presence of massive queries, and can handle large and time-varying datasets.

Conclusion: Sigma-counting provides an effective solution for privacy-preserving counting queries that overcomes limitations of traditional noisy counting methods, offering better accuracy and handling of nested queries and large datasets.

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

*Leonardo Zini,Elia Frigieri,Sebastiano Aloscari,Marcello Generali,Lorenzo Dodi,Robert Dosen,Lorenzo Baraldi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SVGauge is a new human-aligned metric for evaluating text-to-SVG generation that combines visual fidelity and semantic consistency, outperforming existing metrics like FID and CLIPScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image evaluation metrics fail to properly assess SVG images due to their symbolic and vectorial nature, creating a need for specialized evaluation criteria.

Method: SVGauge jointly measures visual fidelity using SigLIP image embeddings refined with PCA/whitening, and semantic consistency by comparing BLIP-2-generated captions against original prompts using SBERT and TF-IDF.

Result: SVGauge achieves the highest correlation with human judgments and faithfully reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators on the SHE benchmark.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the necessity of vector-specific evaluation and provides a practical tool for benchmarking future text-to-SVG generation models.

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

*Jierui Ren,Haojie Jin,Bo Pang,Yisong Chen,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Neural cone radiosity method uses reflectance-aware ray cone encoding with multi-resolution hash grids to efficiently model high-frequency glossy radiance distributions in real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural radiosity methods struggle with high-frequency, view-dependent radiance distributions from glossy materials due to reliance on positional encoding alone.

Method: Proposes reflectance-aware ray cone encoding using pre-filtered multi-resolution hash grids to approximate glossy BSDF lobes and embed view-dependent reflectance characteristics through spatial aggregation.

Result: Produces high-quality, noise-free real-time renderings across various glossiness levels with superior fidelity and realism compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves modeling of high-frequency reflections while maintaining compact and efficient network architecture.

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

TL;DR: Novel framework transfers labels from clinical actigraphy to consumer wearables like Apple Watch using time-series foundation models and adversarial alignment in shared latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality medical labels exist for clinical actigraphy but not for consumer wearables, and manual labeling is expensive and doesn't scale.

Method: Projects both domains into shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models, then uses adversarial alignment to force source and target embedding distributions to align for label transfer.

Result: Enables label transfer across device types without requiring paired data between source and target domains.

Conclusion: The framework successfully facilitates cross-device label transfer by aligning representations in a shared latent space, overcoming the lack of paired data.

Abstract: High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data
but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually
labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a
novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g.,
actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired
data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains
into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models
(TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations.
Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label
transfer across device type.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes two channel estimation algorithms (SD-OMP and tensor-OMP) for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems using extremely large antenna arrays, showing that tensor-OMP achieves comparable performance with lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extremely large antenna arrays in 6G networks often operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, making conventional far-field assumptions invalid. Multi-UAV systems enable distributed ELAA but require accurate channel estimation methods.

Method: Derived closed-form SNR expressions under different wave models (PWM, SWM, HSPWM) and proposed two algorithms: SD-OMP (generalizing polar domain to consider elevation, azimuth, and range) and tensor-OMP (leveraging tensor formulation under HSPWM).

Result: Simulation results show tensor-OMP achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP, while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

Conclusion: The hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM) provides a good balance between accuracy and tractability, and tensor-OMP is an efficient channel estimation solution for distributed near-field multi-UAV systems with ELAA.

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC combines sensing and communication for 6G networks, reducing hardware complexity and spectrum congestion, but conventional techniques introduce high computational complexity that DL can overcome.

Method: Comprehensive review and categorization of state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC tasks including waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data demodulation, and interference mitigation.

Result: DL-based techniques offer efficient, near-optimal solutions with reduced computational complexity, making them suitable for real-time systems with limited resources and low latency requirements.

Conclusion: DL techniques provide significant advantages for ISAC systems, though challenges remain, and the survey outlines future research directions for this emerging field.

Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages

Conclusion: The toric geometry framework provides powerful mathematical tools for analyzing ReLU neural networks, with applications to determining exact function realizability and revealing deep connections between neural networks and algebraic/tropical geometry.

Abstract: Given a continuous finitely piecewise linear function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to
\mathbb{R}$ and a fixed architecture $(n_0,\ldots,n_k;1)$ of feedforward ReLU

structures and tools from algebraic geometry to study ReLU neural networks.
Starting with an unbiased ReLU neural network with rational weights, we define
the ReLU fan, the ReLU toric variety, and the ReLU Cartier divisor associated
with the network. This work also reveals the connection between the tropical
geometry and the toric geometry of ReLU neural networks. As an application of
the toric geometry framework, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion of
functions realizable by unbiased shallow ReLU neural networks by computing
intersection numbers of the ReLU Cartier divisor and torus-invariant curves.

Abstract: The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth,
and scaling limits of conventional electronic platforms. Electronic-photonic
integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for
next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high

Conclusion: ArGen provides a technical foundation for achieving verifiable compliance with diverse governance requirements, enabling 'Governable AI' systems that are ethically robust and safe for global deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in

Motivation: To address the avoidable failure of NEDA's Tessa chatbot that provided harmful weight-loss advice, highlighting the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare contexts and the need for practical safety engineering.

Method: Proposes a hybrid safety middleware combining deterministic lexical gates with an in-line LLM policy filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single model call. Uses synthetic evaluations to test the approach.

Conclusion: Robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI doesn't require heavyweight infrastructure - explicit, testable checks at the last mile are sufficient to prevent similar incidents, with governance ensuring sustainability.

Abstract: In 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association's (NEDA) chatbot Tessa was

perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency,
outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we
map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST
SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls.
The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does
not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last
mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation
ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.

### [253] [The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Traditional Art Forms: A Disruption or Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07029)
*Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Sai Teja Erukude,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI's impact on traditional arts is dual - it can democratize creativity and preserve heritage but also threatens authenticity and jobs. The paper advocates for ethical guidelines and collaborative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the complex duality of AI's role in traditional arts - both as a disruptive force and enhancement tool, examining both positive and negative impacts across various art forms.

Method: Analysis of AI technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators through examples and data across painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and crafts.

Result: AI shows potential for democratizing creative expression, improving productivity, and preserving cultural heritage, but also poses threats to authenticity, ethical concerns around data, and socio-economic issues like job losses.

Conclusion: AI's impact is context-dependent. The future requires ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches, and inclusive development to ensure AI amplifies human creativity without displacing the cultural and emotional aspects of traditional art.

Abstract: The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the domains of
traditional art (visual arts, performing arts, and crafts) has sparked a
complicated discussion about whether this might be an agent of disruption or an
enhancement of our traditional art forms. This paper looks at the duality of
AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial
Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the
fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of
craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize
creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage,
while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to
authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including
socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the
context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative
homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also
illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We
advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches,
and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of
AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement
of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future
will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a
mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid proliferation of AI across sectors requires robust frameworks to guide responsible engagement and adoption.

Method: Developed an 8-level maturity model inspired by Maslow's hierarchy, validated through four diverse case studies (General Motors, Estonia Government, University of Texas System, African Union AI Strategy).

Result: The model demonstrates contextual flexibility across sectors and provides a diagnostic tool for analyzing AI maturity.

Conclusion: AI maturity progression requires technological capability, ethical integrity, organizational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration - it's multi-dimensional.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across industry,
government, and education highlights the urgent need for robust frameworks to
conceptualise and guide engagement. This paper introduces the Hierarchy of
Engagement with AI model, a novel maturity framework inspired by Maslow's
hierarchy of needs. The model conceptualises AI adoption as a progression
through eight levels, beginning with initial exposure and basic understanding
and culminating in ecosystem collaboration and societal impact. Each level
integrates technical, organisational, and ethical dimensions, emphasising that
AI maturity is not only a matter of infrastructure and capability but also of
trust, governance, and responsibility. Initial validation of the model using
four diverse case studies (General Motors, the Government of Estonia, the
University of Texas System, and the African Union AI Strategy) demonstrate the
model's contextual flexibility across various sectors. The model provides
scholars with a framework for analysing AI maturity and offers practitioners
and policymakers a diagnostic and strategic planning tool to guide responsible
and sustainable AI engagement. The proposed model demonstrates that AI maturity
progression is multi-dimensional, requiring technological capability, ethical
integrity, organisational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration.

*Jiahuan Yu,Aryan Taneja,Junfeng Lin,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: VoltanaLLM is an energy-efficient LLM serving system that uses control theory to dynamically scale GPU frequencies and route requests, achieving up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining service level objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The soaring energy cost of LLM inference presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment of interactive applications like real-time chat assistants and code generation tools.

Method: VoltanaLLM co-designs frequency scaling and request routing in prefill/decode disaggregated architectures. It uses a feedback-driven frequency controller to dynamically adapt GPU frequency for different phases, and a state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled instances to minimize energy under latency constraints.

Result: The system achieves up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: VoltanaLLM paves the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving by effectively balancing energy efficiency with performance requirements in modern LLM serving systems.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support
interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation
tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference
presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment.
This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM
serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs
frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated
architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained
phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller
that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a
state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled
instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM
in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to
36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving
the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.

*Anjiang Wei,Tianran Sun,Yogesh Seenichamy,Hang Song,Anne Ouyang,Azalia Mirhoseini,Ke Wang,Alex Aiken*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Astra is the first LLM-based multi-agent system that optimizes existing CUDA kernels from SGLang framework, achieving 1.32x average speedup through collaborative agent workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU kernel optimization is crucial for LLM training/serving but requires extensive manual tuning. Existing compiler systems still demand substantial engineering effort, and prior LLM approaches only translate PyTorch to CUDA rather than optimizing existing implementations.

Method: Multi-agent LLM system where specialized agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning. Starts from existing CUDA implementations from SGLang framework rather than PyTorch modules.

Result: Achieves average 1.32x speedup on SGLang kernels using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. LLMs autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, use CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM systems represent a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization, demonstrating that LLMs can autonomously produce both correct and high-performance kernels through collaborative workflows.

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

TL;DR: MoMA is a generalized routing framework that combines LLM and agent-based routing to efficiently handle diverse user queries by directing them to the most appropriate execution units based on cost-performance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of user queries spanning multiple domains and task types creates a complex routing challenge in AI service ecosystems, requiring accurate query direction while optimizing both performance and efficiency.

Method: MoMA integrates LLM and agent-based routing with precise intent recognition and adaptive strategies. It uses a detailed training dataset to profile LLM capabilities, implements dynamic routing to optimal LLMs, and employs context-aware state machine with dynamic masking for agent selection.

Result: Experimental results show MoMA router provides superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: MoMA effectively addresses the routing challenge in heterogeneous AI service landscapes by achieving optimal balance between efficiency and cost through intelligent query routing.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI
agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries,
however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types,
resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a
fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an
appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To
address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized
routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon
a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles
diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing
strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.
Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the
capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,
identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are
dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We
also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware
state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: First comprehensive survey on AI agents for blockchain, focusing on security and privacy aspects of AI-driven blockchain systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain complexity creates barriers for non-experts, and existing literature lacks focused surveys on AI agents specifically for blockchain applications.

Method: Systematization of Knowledge approach to survey and categorize AI-driven systems for blockchain, with special emphasis on security and privacy dimensions.

Result: Provides comprehensive analysis of AI applications in blockchain including on-chain data analysis, transaction optimization, and smart contract vulnerability detection.

Conclusion: Identifies applications, limitations, and future research directions for AI agents in blockchain ecosystems, addressing the gap in specialized literature.

Abstract: Blockchain and smart contracts have garnered significant interest in recent
years as the foundation of a decentralized, trustless digital ecosystem,
thereby eliminating the need for traditional centralized authorities. Despite
their central role in powering Web3, their complexity still presents
significant barriers for non-expert users. To bridge this gap, Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based agents have emerged as valuable tools for interacting
with blockchain environments, supporting a range of tasks, from analyzing
on-chain data and optimizing transaction strategies to detecting
vulnerabilities within smart contracts. While interest in applying AI to
blockchain is growing, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey that
focuses specifically on the intersection with AI agents. Most of the related
work only provides general considerations, without focusing on any specific
domain. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first Systematization
of Knowledge dedicated to AI-driven systems for blockchain, with a special
focus on their security and privacy dimensions, shedding light on their
applications, limitations, and future research directions.

*Tomás González,Mateo Dulce-Rubio,Aaditya Ramdas,Mónica Ribero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A sequential test for auditing differential privacy in black-box mechanisms that provides anytime-valid inference with controlled Type I error, requiring significantly fewer samples than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing batch auditing methods for differential privacy have fixed sample size limitations and require large numbers of examples (e.g., 50K) to detect violations, making them impractical for real-time auditing.

Method: Proposes a practical sequential test that processes streams of mechanisms' outputs, enabling anytime-valid inference while controlling Type I error probability.

Result: The test detects differential privacy violations with sample sizes orders of magnitude smaller than existing methods - reducing from 50K to a few hundred examples across diverse realistic mechanisms. Notably identifies DP-SGD privacy violations in under one training run.

Conclusion: This sequential auditing approach provides a practical and efficient method for real-time verification of differential privacy guarantees, overcoming the limitations of traditional batch methods and enabling detection with dramatically reduced sample requirements.

Abstract: We propose a practical sequential test for auditing differential privacy
guarantees of black-box mechanisms. The test processes streams of mechanisms'
outputs providing anytime-valid inference while controlling Type I error,
overcoming the fixed sample size limitation of previous batch auditing methods.
Experiments show this test detects violations with sample sizes that are orders
of magnitude smaller than existing methods, reducing this number from 50K to a
few hundred examples, across diverse realistic mechanisms. Notably, it
identifies DP-SGD privacy violations in \textit{under} one training run, unlike

### [261] [Paladin: Defending LLM-enabled Phishing Emails with a New Trigger-Tag Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07287)
*Yan Pang,Wenlong Meng,Xiaojing Liao,Tianhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Paladin embeds trigger-tag associations into LLMs to automatically mark phishing content with detectable tags, achieving over 90% detection accuracy across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate sophisticated phishing emails that evade traditional detection methods, creating a need for practical, scalable detection solutions that don't rely on linguistic features.

Method: Embed trigger-tag associations into vanilla LLMs using insertion strategies to create instrumented models that automatically include detectable tags when generating phishing content, with implicit/explicit triggers and tags across four scenarios.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods with over 90% detection accuracy across all scenarios, demonstrating strong stealthiness, effectiveness, and robustness.

Conclusion: Paladin provides a practical and effective solution for detecting LLM-generated phishing content at scale, addressing the limitations of existing semantic-level and LLM-based detection approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the potential threat of
their malicious use, particularly in generating phishing content, is becoming
increasingly prevalent. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users
can synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other
easily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate
topic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and
increasing the likelihood of success.
  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated
phishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a
result, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify
them reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,
they suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the
performance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for
large-scale deployment.
  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds
trigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,
creating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates
content related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,
enabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit
triggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work. We evaluate
our method from three key perspectives: stealthiness, effectiveness, and
robustness, and compare it with existing baseline methods. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the baselines, achieving over 90% detection
accuracy across all scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: zkUnlearner is the first zero-knowledge framework for verifiable machine unlearning that supports multi-granularity (sample/feature/class level) and resists forging attacks using bit-masking techniques and gradient forgery prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for 'right to be forgotten' requires transparent and accountable machine unlearning solutions that can verify data removal while preventing forgery attacks.

Method: Uses bit-masking technique to enable selectivity in zero-knowledge proofs for gradient descent algorithms, supports multiple granularity levels, and implements strategies to resist gradient forging attacks in SGD optimization.

Result: Framework can be translated to arithmetic circuits for broad ZKP system compatibility, overcomes efficiency and privacy limitations of existing methods, and demonstrates practicality through comprehensive benchmarking.

Conclusion: zkUnlearner provides the first verifiable multi-granularity machine unlearning framework with forgery resistance, addressing critical needs for transparency and accountability in data removal processes.

Abstract: As the demand for exercising the "right to be forgotten" grows, the need for
verifiable machine unlearning has become increasingly evident to ensure both
transparency and accountability. We present {\em zkUnlearner}, the first
zero-knowledge framework for verifiable machine unlearning, specifically
designed to support {\em multi-granularity} and {\em forgery-resistance}.
  First, we propose a general computational model that employs a {\em
bit-masking} technique to enable the {\em selectivity} of existing
zero-knowledge proofs of training for gradient descent algorithms. This
innovation enables not only traditional {\em sample-level} unlearning but also
more advanced {\em feature-level} and {\em class-level} unlearning. Our model
can be translated to arithmetic circuits, ensuring compatibility with a broad
range of zero-knowledge proof systems. Furthermore, our approach overcomes key
limitations of existing methods in both efficiency and privacy. Second, forging
attacks present a serious threat to the reliability of unlearning.
Specifically, in Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, gradients from
unlearned data, or from minibatches containing it, can be forged using
alternative data samples or minibatches that exclude it. We propose the first
effective strategies to resist state-of-the-art forging attacks. Finally, we
benchmark a zkSNARK-based instantiation of our framework and perform
comprehensive performance evaluations to validate its practicality.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes guided reasoning pipeline using MITRE ATT&CK Matrix to improve LLM penetration testing accuracy and efficiency, reducing hallucinations and unproductive actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents for penetration testing rely on self-guided reasoning which produces inaccurate/hallucinated steps, leading to unproductive actions like exploiting unused libraries or cyclical responses.

Method: Uses deterministic task tree built from MITRE ATT&CK Matrix to constrain LLM reasoning to proven tactics, techniques, and procedures. Evaluated with three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, GPT-4) on 10 HackTheBox exercises with 103 subtasks.

Result: Guided pipeline achieved 71.8%, 72.8%, and 78.6% subtask completion vs 13.5%, 16.5%, and 75.7% for self-guided reasoning. Also reduced model queries by 86.2%, 118.7%, and 205.9% respectively.

Conclusion: Incorporating deterministic task trees into LLM reasoning pipelines significantly enhances accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity penetration testing assessments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in
automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of
faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems.
Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided
reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a
result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting
unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior
tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration
testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the
MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the
LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and
procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies
and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more
productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated
penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and
GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with
103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our
proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and
78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.
Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using
self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and
required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that
incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ImportSnare attack framework exploits RAG vulnerabilities to hijack code generation by poisoning documentation with malicious dependencies, achieving over 50% success rates even with low poisoning ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) enhances code correctness but introduces new attack surfaces through malicious dependency hijacking, exploiting dual trust chains in LLM reliance and developer trust.

Method: Proposes ImportSnare framework with two strategies: 1) Position-aware beam search to optimize hidden ranking sequences for poisoned document retrieval, and 2) Multilingual inductive suggestions to jailbreak LLMs into recommending malicious dependencies.

Result: Achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for popular libraries) across Python, Rust, and JavaScript, even with poisoning ratios as low as 0.01%, targeting both custom and real-world malicious packages.

Conclusion: Reveals critical supply chain risks in LLM-powered development and highlights inadequate security alignment for code generation tasks, with plans to release multilingual benchmark suite for future research.

Abstract: Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language
Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all
skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic
often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in
generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual
debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness
and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces
new attack surfaces.
  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in
Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency
hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden
malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting
dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM
suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel
attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam
search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in
retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate
jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious
dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and
JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for
popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able
to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both
custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply
chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security
alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will
release the multilingual benchmark suite and datasets. The project homepage is

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper develops machine learning methods to detect causal relationships from observational data using physics-based response theory, addressing the challenge of distinguishing correlation from causation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal relationships are fundamental for understanding complex systems and making informed decisions, but identifying them from observational data is difficult due to correlation not implying causation.

Method: The authors use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build models from data within the framework of physics response theory, considering both linear stochastic and non-linear systems.

Result: The paper computes the asymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor for large scale Markov process networks with linear interactions.

Conclusion: Machine learning combined with physics-based response theory provides a powerful approach for uncovering hidden causal mechanisms in complex systems.

Abstract: Causal relationships play a fundamental role in understanding the world
around us. The ability to identify and understand cause-effect relationships is
critical to making informed decisions, predicting outcomes, and developing
effective strategies. However, deciphering causal relationships from
observational data is a difficult task, as correlations alone may not provide
definitive evidence of causality. In recent years, the field of machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, offering new opportunities for
uncovering hidden causal mechanisms and better understanding complex systems.
In this work, we address the issue of detecting the intrinsic causal links of a
large class of complex systems in the framework of the response theory in
physics. We develop some theoretical ideas put forward by [1], and technically
we use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build up models from data. We consider
both linear stochastic and non-linear systems. Finally, we compute the
asymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor in a case
of large scale Markov process network of linear interactions.

Abstract: The complexity of large-scale 6G-and-beyond networks demands innovative
approaches for multi-objective optimization over vast search spaces, a task
often intractable. Quantum computing (QC) emerges as a promising technology for
efficient large-scale optimization. We present our vision of leveraging QC to
tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and
identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation,
we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline
a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum
reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC
algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.

### [267] [A multi-strategy improved gazelle optimization algorithm for solving numerical optimization and engineering applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07211)
*Qi Diao,Chengyue Xie,Yuchen Yin,Hoileong Lee,Haolong Yang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: MSIGOA is an improved gazelle optimization algorithm that addresses GOA's exploration-exploitation imbalance and poor population information exchange through iterative switching, adaptive parameter tuning, and dominant population restart strategies, achieving superior performance on benchmark tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the shortcomings of the original gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA), specifically the imbalance between exploration and exploitation phases and insufficient information exchange within the population.

Method: Proposes MSIGOA with: 1) iteration-based updating framework that switches between exploitation and exploration, 2) two adaptive parameter tuning strategies, and 3) dominant population-based restart strategy to escape local optima.

Result: MSIGOA outperforms basic GOA and other advanced algorithms on CEC2017 (92.2% not worse than GOA, 88.57% not worse than others) and CEC2022 (83.3% not worse than GOA, 87.5% not worse than others) benchmark sets, with verified extensibility on engineering design problems.

Conclusion: The proposed MSIGOA significantly enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, improves convergence speed and efficiency, and demonstrates superior performance in handling complex optimization problems compared to existing algorithms.

Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the
imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information
exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved
gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA
proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between
exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which
effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global
exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two
adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm
and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based
restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima
and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior
convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the
parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the
proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and
CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic
GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the
proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,
respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than
other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility
of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization
problems.

### [268] [Breaking the Conventional Forward-Backward Tie in Neural Networks: Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07236)
*Luigi Troiano,Francesco Gissi,Vincenzo Benedetto,Genny Tortora*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Challenges traditional symmetry between forward and backward propagation in neural networks, showing that precise gradient magnitudes are unnecessary as long as gradient direction is preserved, enabling effective training with flat/non-differentiable activation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional gradient-based training enforces strict symmetry between forward and backward propagation, limiting activation function choices to differentiable and monotonic functions, which excludes many potentially useful functions with flat or non-differentiable regions.

Method: Mathematical analysis demonstrating redundancy of precise gradient magnitudes, plus empirical experiments on MLPs, CNNs, and BNNs using simplified or stochastic gradient alternatives instead of traditional exact gradients.

Result: Relaxing forward-backward symmetry and using simpler gradient alternatives does not impair learning and may improve training stability and efficiency. Networks with flat/non-differentiable activation functions (like Heaviside step) can be effectively trained.

Conclusion: Forward-backward symmetry in neural network training is unnecessarily restrictive. Preserving gradient direction is sufficient, enabling more flexible activation function design and improved computational efficiency, with promising implications for complex architectures.

Abstract: Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry
between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be
differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain
regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward
activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the
selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with
substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge
this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise
gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,
provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted
on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -
confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional
gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and
may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate
that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such
as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding
design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation
with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future
research.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer a promising path toward energy-efficient,
brain-like associative memory. This paper introduces Word2Spike, a novel rate
coding mechanism that combines continuous word embeddings and neuromorphic

word vectors into spike-based attractor states using Poisson processes. Using
BitNet b1.58 quantization, we maintain 97% semantic similarity of continuous
embeddings on SimLex-999 while achieving 100% reconstruction accuracy on 10,000
words from OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large. We preserve analogy performance
(100% of original embedding performance) even under intentionally introduced
noise, indicating a resilient mechanism for semantic encoding in neuromorphic
systems. Next steps include integrating the mapping with spiking transformers
and liquid state machines (resembling Hopfield Networks) for further
evaluation.

Result: Performs comparably to classical KMeans counterpart while showing greater resilience to label corruption than supervised bagging methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of unsupervised quantum bagging for learning from unreliable data in quantum machine learning applications.

Abstract: The development of noise-resilient quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms
is critical in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work,
we propose a quantum bagging framework that uses QMeans clustering as the base

Unlike bagging frameworks built on supervised learners, our method leverages
the unsupervised nature of QMeans, combined with quantum bootstrapping via
QRAM-based sampling and bagging aggregation through majority voting. Through
extensive simulations on both noisy classification and regression tasks, we
demonstrate that the proposed quantum bagging algorithm performs comparably to
its classical counterpart using KMeans while exhibiting greater resilience to
label corruption than supervised bagging methods. This highlights the potential
of unsupervised quantum bagging in learning from unreliable data.

TL;DR: Quantum annealing-based graph clustering algorithm (GCS-Q) outperforms classical methods for financial correlation clustering by directly handling signed correlation structures without heuristic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical clustering methods struggle with signed correlation structures in financial data, requiring lossy transformations and fixed cluster number assumptions, which limits their effectiveness in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage.

Method: Applied Graph-based Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) that formulates partitioning as QUBO problems, enabling quantum annealing to efficiently explore large solution spaces for signed, weighted graph clustering.

Result: GCS-Q consistently achieved higher clustering quality (measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties) compared to SPONGE and k-Medoids on both synthetic and real-world financial data, while dynamically determining optimal cluster numbers.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based unsupervised learning in financial applications, offering superior performance over classical algorithms for correlation clustering tasks.

Abstract: Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental
task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical
clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation
structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions
such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based
Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed,
weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each
partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing
for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate
our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking
against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our
experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering
quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties,
while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight
the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based
unsupervised learning in financial applications.

TL;DR: Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) shows quadratic speedup over classical methods by using quantum mechanical realization of Markov decision processes, with environment parameters learned from classical data via quantum machine learning on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how quantum environment parameters can be learned from classical observational data using quantum machine learning, enabling quantum policy evaluation on actual quantum hardware rather than just simulators.

Method: Using quantum machine learning (QML) to learn environment parameters from batch classical data, then applying the learned quantum environment in quantum policy evaluation (QPE) on quantum hardware to compute policy evaluations.

Result: Experiments show that despite challenges like noise and short coherence times, the integration of QML and QPE demonstrates promising potential for achieving quantum advantage in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The successful implementation of learning quantum environments from classical data and executing QPE on quantum hardware represents a significant step toward practical quantum advantage in reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
which is quadratically more efficient than an analogous classical Monte Carlo
estimation. It makes use of a direct quantum mechanical realization of a finite
Markov decision process, in which the agent and the environment are modeled by
unitary operators and exchange states, actions, and rewards in superposition.
Previously, the quantum environment has been implemented and parametrized
manually for an illustrative benchmark using a quantum simulator. In this
paper, we demonstrate how these environment parameters can be learned from a
batch of classical observational data through quantum machine learning (QML) on
quantum hardware. The learned quantum environment is then applied in QPE to
also compute policy evaluations on quantum hardware. Our experiments reveal
that, despite challenges such as noise and short coherence times, the
integration of QML and QPE shows promising potential for achieving quantum
advantage in RL.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Kernel VICReg extends VICReg SSL to RKHS using kernel methods, enabling nonlinear feature learning without explicit mappings and showing improved performance on complex/small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SSL methods operate in Euclidean space, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric structures. The authors aim to bridge classical kernel methods with modern representation learning.

Method: Lifts VICReg objective into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) by kernelizing each term of the loss (variance, invariance, covariance) using double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms.

Result: Consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet100, with strong improvements on datasets with prominent nonlinear structures. UMAP visualizations show better isometry and class separation.

Conclusion: Kernelizing SSL objectives is a promising direction that avoids representational collapse and improves performance, particularly benefiting tasks with complex or small-scale data.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ADHAM is an interpretable additive survival model that provides subgroup-specific hazard functions while maintaining predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art neural survival models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most neural network survival models lack interpretability, which is critical for clinical decision-making where understanding exposure-outcome relationships is essential.

Method: Proposes Additive Deep Hazard Analysis Mixtures (ADHAM) with conditional latent structure defining subgroups, each with covariate-specific hazard functions. Includes post-training refinement to merge similar subgroups and select optimal group count.

Result: ADHAM provides interpretable insights at population, subgroup, and individual levels while achieving predictive performance on par with state-of-the-art survival baselines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ADHAM offers a scalable and interpretable approach to time-to-event prediction in healthcare, bridging the gap between predictive performance and clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event outcomes
in healthcare. Recent advances have introduced flexible neural network
approaches for improved predictive performance. However, most of these models
do not provide interpretable insights into the association between exposures
and the modeled outcomes, a critical requirement for decision-making in
clinical practice. To address this limitation, we propose Additive Deep Hazard
Analysis Mixtures (ADHAM), an interpretable additive survival model. ADHAM
assumes a conditional latent structure that defines subgroups, each
characterized by a combination of covariate-specific hazard functions. To
select the number of subgroups, we introduce a post-training refinement that
reduces the number of equivalent latent subgroups by merging similar groups. We
perform comprehensive studies to demonstrate ADHAM's interpretability at the
population, subgroup, and individual levels. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that ADHAM provides novel insights into the
association between exposures and outcomes. Further, ADHAM remains on par with
existing state-of-the-art survival baselines in terms of predictive
performance, offering a scalable and interpretable approach to time-to-event
prediction in healthcare.

*Yuqi Zhou,Zhanhong Cheng,Lingqian Hu,Yuheng Bu,Shenhao Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes NestGNN - a graph neural network that generalizes nested logit models for travel mode choice analysis, combining neural networks' flexibility with NL's substitution patterns while achieving 9.2% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical nested logit models have limited representation capability and handcrafted utility specification, while existing deep neural networks cannot explicitly capture inter-alternative correlations in discrete choice contexts.

Method: Introduces alternative graph concept to represent travel mode relationships, then designs nested-utility graph neural network (NestGNN) as generalization of classical NL models with two-layer substitution patterns.

Result: NestGNNs significantly outperform benchmark models by 9.2%, retain NL's substitution patterns (proportional within nests, non-proportional beyond nests), and provide more flexibility in model design.

Conclusion: NestGNN demonstrates strong performance in prediction and interpretation while generalizing classical NL models with greater flexibility for travel mode choice analysis.

Abstract: Nested logit (NL) has been commonly used for discrete choice analysis,
including a wide range of applications such as travel mode choice, automobile
ownership, or location decisions. However, the classical NL models are
restricted by their limited representation capability and handcrafted utility
specification. While researchers introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) to
tackle such challenges, the existing DNNs cannot explicitly capture
inter-alternative correlations in the discrete choice context. To address the
challenges, this study proposes a novel concept - alternative graph - to
represent the relationships among travel mode alternatives. Using a nested
alternative graph, this study further designs a nested-utility graph neural
network (NestGNN) as a generalization of the classical NL model in the neural
network family. Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and
existing DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial
two-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution
within a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we
find that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models,
particularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\%. As shown by elasticity
tables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer
substitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its
model design space. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of NestGNN in
prediction, interpretation, and its flexibility of generalizing the classical
NL model for analyzing travel mode choice.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Modified LASSO PCR with sparsity ranking and novel JSRL method improve brain activity classification by prioritizing high-variance components, achieving up to 51.7% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LASSO PCR assumes all principal components equally contain relevant information, but task-related signals are often concentrated in specific high-variance components, leading to suboptimal component selection.

Method: Proposed modifications to LASSO PCR with regularization penalty tied to component index, and developed Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL) that integrates component-level and voxel-level activity with ranked sparsity under information parity framework.

Result: Sparsity-ranked models showed enhanced classification performance with up to 51.7% improvement in cross-validated deviance R² and 7.3% improvement in AUC across risk taking, monetary incentive, and emotion regulation tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating sparsity ranking into LASSO PCR produces robust models with better performance than standard approaches, allocating predictive weight to functionally relevant brain regions, offering improved MVPA alternatives.

Abstract: Recent advances in neuroimaging analysis have enabled accurate decoding of
mental state from brain activation patterns during functional magnetic
resonance imaging scans. A commonly applied tool for this purpose is principal
components regression regularized with the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO PCR), a type of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).
This model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant
information, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in
specific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal
set of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the
cognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that
allow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal
component, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely
to be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we
propose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which
integrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity
framework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply
the models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and
emotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity
ranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification
performance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\% improvement in cross-validated
deviance $R^2$ and 7.3\% improvement in cross-validated AUC. Furthermore,
sparsity-ranked models perform as well as or better than standard LASSO PCR
approaches across all classification tasks and allocate predictive weight to
brain regions consistent with their established functional roles, offering a
robust alternative for MVPA.

Motivation: Traditional decentralized algorithms are vulnerable to data contamination in distributed AI settings, requiring more robust statistics against corrupted or adversarial data

Method: Develop gossip algorithms for computing rank-based statistics (L-statistics and rank statistics) and apply to robust distributed two-sample hypothesis testing with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests

Result: Provided rigorous convergence guarantees including first convergence rate bound for asynchronous gossip-based rank estimation, validated through experiments on diverse network topologies

Conclusion: The proposed gossip algorithms enable robust decentralized computation of rank-based statistics, addressing vulnerability to data contamination in distributed AI systems

Abstract: As decentralized AI and edge intelligence become increasingly prevalent,
ensuring robustness and trustworthiness in such distributed settings has become
a critical issue-especially in the presence of corrupted or adversarial data.
Traditional decentralized algorithms are vulnerable to data contamination as
they typically rely on simple statistics (e.g., means or sum), motivating the
need for more robust statistics. In line with recent work on decentralized
estimation of trimmed means and ranks, we develop gossip algorithms for
computing a broad class of rank-based statistics, including L-statistics and
rank statistics-both known for their robustness to outliers. We apply our
method to perform robust distributed two-sample hypothesis testing, introducing
the first gossip algorithm for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We provide rigorous
convergence guarantees, including the first convergence rate bound for
asynchronous gossip-based rank estimation. We empirically validate our
theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies.

guarantees under minimal assumptions on the problem data, they can exhibit the
slow tail-convergence typical of first-order schemes, thus requiring many
iterations to achieve high-accuracy solutions. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning
significantly impacts on the solver performance but how to find an appropriate
parameter configuration remains an elusive research question. To address these
issues, we explore how data-driven approaches can accelerate the solution
process. Aiming at high-accuracy solutions, we focus on a stabilized
interior-point solver and carefully handle its two-loop flow and control
parameters. We will show that reinforcement learning can make a significant
contribution to facilitating the solver tuning and to speeding up the
optimization process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, after a
lightweight training, the learned policy generalizes well to different problem
classes with varying dimensions and to various solver configurations.

### [282] [Decentralized Online Riemannian Optimization Beyond Hadamard Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07779)
*Emre Sahinoglu,Shahin Shahrampour*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Decentralized online Riemannian optimization on manifolds with positive curvature, achieving O(√T) regret bounds through curvature-aware consensus and smoothing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized optimization methods rely on Euclidean consensus steps that don't work well on positively curved Riemannian manifolds due to lack of global convex structure from geodesic distances.

Method: Developed a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step for linear convergence, then used decentralized online Riemannian gradient descent with smoothing techniques for bandit feedback scenarios.

Result: Achieved O(√T) regret bound for decentralized online Riemannian gradient descent, and maintained the same bound for two-point bandit feedback using smoothed gradient estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed curvature-aware consensus enables effective decentralized optimization beyond Hadamard manifolds, with strong theoretical guarantees even in challenging bandit feedback settings.

Abstract: We study decentralized online Riemannian optimization over manifolds with
possibly positive curvature, going beyond the Hadamard manifold setting.
Decentralized optimization techniques rely on a consensus step that is well
understood in Euclidean spaces because of their linearity. However, in
positively curved Riemannian spaces, a main technical challenge is that
geodesic distances may not induce a globally convex structure. In this work, we
first analyze a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step that enables a linear
convergence beyond Hadamard manifolds. Building on this step, we establish a
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the decentralized online Riemannian gradient
descent algorithm. Then, we investigate the two-point bandit feedback setup,
where we employ computationally efficient gradient estimators using smoothing
techniques, and we demonstrate the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound through the
subconvexity analysis of smoothed objectives.

### [283] [Contradictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07026)
*Yang Xu,Shuwei Chen,Xiaomei Zhong,Jun Liu,Xingxing He*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper presents methods for constructing standard contradictions to enhance automated theorem proving, moving beyond classical binary resolution by enabling multi-clause deduction through contradiction-separation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical binary resolution in automated theorem proving is limited as it only processes two clauses at a time and eliminates at most two literals per step, creating a bottleneck for more powerful and transparent reasoning systems.

Method: The study focuses on systematic construction of standard contradictions, specifically maximum triangular standard contradiction and triangular-type standard contradiction, and proposes procedures for determining clause set satisfiability/unsatisfiability through maximum standard contradiction.

Result: The paper derives formulas for computing the number of standard sub-contradictions within both maximum triangular and triangular-type standard contradictions, providing a methodological foundation for advanced deduction.

Conclusion: The developed framework extends automated reasoning capabilities beyond classical binary resolution, enabling contradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction for more expressive and powerful theorem proving systems.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI requires reasoning systems that are not only powerful but also
transparent and reliable. Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is central to formal
reasoning, yet classical binary resolution remains limited, as each step
involves only two clauses and eliminates at most two literals. To overcome this
bottleneck, the concept of standard contradiction and the theory of
contradiction-separation-based deduction were introduced in 2018. This paper
advances that framework by focusing on the systematic construction of standard
contradictions. Specially, this study investigates construction methods for two
principal forms of standard contradiction: the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. Building on these
structures, we propose a procedure for determining the satisfiability and
unsatisfiability of clause sets via maximum standard contradiction.
Furthermore, we derive formulas for computing the number of standard
sub-contradictions embedded within both the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. The results
presented herein furnish the methodological basis for advancing
contradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction,
thereby extending the expressive and deductive capabilities of automated
reasoning systems beyond the classical binary paradigm.

### [284] [What Were You Thinking? An LLM-Driven Large-Scale Study of Refactoring Motivations in Open-Source Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07763)
*Mikel Robredo,Matteo Esposito,Fabio Palomba,Rafael Peñaloza,Valentina Lenarduzzi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs can identify code refactoring motivations with 80% accuracy compared to human judgment but only 47% alignment with literature, providing detailed rationales focused on readability and maintainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why developers refactor code and identify which metrics capture these motivations to support more effective refactoring practices.

Method: Large-scale empirical study analyzing developers' refactoring activity using Large Language Models to identify motivations from version control data, comparing findings with previous literature.

Result: LLMs matched human judgment in 80% of cases but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They enriched 22% of motivations with detailed rationale, focusing on readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were pragmatic (simplification and maintainability).

Conclusion: LLMs effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations that, when combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches for systematic refactoring prioritization.

Abstract: Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external
behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable
cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding
why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may
support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores using LLM-based tools like PentestGPT for Android penetration testing automation, comparing AI-generated exploitation methods with traditional manual rooting techniques to evaluate efficacy, reliability, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of AI and LLMs has created new opportunities in cybersecurity, particularly for automation in penetration testing and exploitation, which this research aims to explore specifically for Android device security.

Method: Used Android emulator (Genymotion) as testbed to execute both traditional manual rooting and AI-generated exploit-based methods. Created a web application integrating OpenAI's API to automate script generation from LLM responses, comparing automated vs manual penetration testing protocols.

Result: Findings show that LLMs can significantly streamline exploitation workflows but require human oversight to ensure accuracy and ethical application. The study identified both strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in penetration testing.

Conclusion: This research contributes to AI-powered cybersecurity literature, highlighting that while AI tools enhance automation in ethical hacking and mobile security, human control remains essential for accuracy and ethical considerations to prevent potential misuse.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the area of cybersecurity, especially
in the exploitation automation landscape and penetration testing. This study
explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools,
especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a
comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods
produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and
scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege
access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as
the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting
methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create
a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script
generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the
effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual
penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths
along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,
including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while
LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be
controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study
adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its
effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.

*Rohan Garg,Yongjin Xiao,Jason,Yang,Mandar Rahurkar*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: Smart Fast Finish (SFF) is an enhanced budget pacing feature that dynamically adjusts parameters like start time and throttle rate based on historical campaign data to prevent overdelivery, building upon the standard Fast Finish approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the industry standard Fast Finish feature in budget pacing systems by creating a more robust solution that mitigates overdelivery issues when pacing advertising budgets.

Method: SFF dynamically updates system parameters (start time and throttle rate) using historical ad-campaign data, and was implemented at DoorDash's budget pacing system with validation through online budget-split experiments and offline simulations.

Result: The system has been successfully deployed at DoorDash and shown to be a robust solution for overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget, as demonstrated through both online experimentation data and offline simulations.

Conclusion: SFF represents an effective enhancement to traditional budget pacing systems, providing dynamic parameter optimization that prevents budget overdelivery while maintaining operational efficiency in real-world advertising platforms.

Abstract: We present a budget pacing feature called Smart Fast Finish (SFF). SFF builds
upon the industry standard Fast Finish (FF) feature in budget pacing systems
that depletes remaining advertising budget as quickly as possible towards the
end of some fixed time period. SFF dynamically updates system parameters such
as start time and throttle rate depending on historical ad-campaign data. SFF
is currently in use at DoorDash, one of the largest delivery platforms in the
US, and is part of its budget pacing system. We show via online budget-split
experimentation data and offline simulations that SFF is a robust solution for
overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget.

*Youjie Li,Cheng Wan,Zhiqi Lin,Hongyu Zhu,Jiacheng Yang,Ziang Song,Xinyi Di,Jiawei Wu,Huiyao Shu,Wenlei Bao,Yanghua Peng,Haibin Lin,Li-Wen Chang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: veScale is an eager-mode training system that uses SPMD paradigm to simplify distributed LLM training while ensuring consistency and high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training requires complex parallelism approaches like 3D parallelism, which are hard to debug. There's a need for simpler SPMD programming while maintaining consistency with single-device execution and achieving scalability.

Method: Introduces veScale with novel distributed RNG algorithm compatible with arbitrary sharded operators, reduces PyTorch primitive overhead, and improves communication efficiency.

Result: Achieves up to 2.2x speedup over state-of-the-art systems like TorchTitan, reduces code complexity by 78.4%, and preserves single-device-equivalent results.

Conclusion: veScale successfully democratizes distributed tensor programming by providing a simpler SPMD approach that maintains consistency and delivers superior performance for LLM training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have scaled rapidly in size and complexity,
requiring increasingly intricate parallelism for distributed training, such as
3D parallelism. This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more
debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD).
However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring
consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at
scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that
fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming.
veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like
PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number
Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also
significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's
overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale
delivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like
TorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving
single-device-equivalent results.

### [288] [Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Zeolite Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07417)
*Shusuke Ito,Koki Muraoka,Akira Nakayama*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Benchmark study comparing universal interatomic potentials (analytic and machine learning) against established tailor-made potentials for zeolite structures, showing modern pretrained MLIPs are practical tools for zeolite screening workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the applicability of universal interatomic potentials with wide elemental coverage for zeolite systems, as their accuracy for target chemical systems needs careful investigation despite recent developments.

Method: Benchmarked multiple universal IPs (GFN-FF, UFF, Dreiding, CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, EquiformerV2) against established tailor-made IPs (SLC, ClayFF, BSFF) using experimental data and DFT calculations with dispersion correction as reference for various zeolite structures including pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates.

Result: GFN-FF was best among universal analytic IPs but unsatisfactory for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicates. All MLIPs reproduced experimental/DFT geometries and energetics well, with eSEN-30M-OAM showing the most consistent performance across all zeolite structures.

Conclusion: Modern pretrained universal machine learning interatomic potentials are practical tools for zeolite screening workflows involving various compositions, demonstrating their applicability beyond traditional tailor-made potentials.

Abstract: Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy
are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few
years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide
ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems
should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using
equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of
universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs,
including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning
IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and
EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made
IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The
tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates
containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF
is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve
satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate
systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and
energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most
consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings
show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite
screening workflows involving various compositions.

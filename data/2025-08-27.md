### [1] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik KÃ¤ckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents two training-free approaches for underwater 3D object detection using sonar data: neural networks trained on synthetic data and template matching. While neural networks achieve 98% mAP on synthetic data but drop to 40% on real data due to domain shift, template matching maintains 83% mAP on real data without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater 3D object detection faces challenges due to harsh acoustic environments and scarcity of annotated training data, which is expensive and complex to obtain. The research aims to achieve reliable detection without real-world training data.

Method: Developed two paradigms: 1) Physics-based sonar simulation pipeline generating synthetic training data for neural networks, and 2) Model-based template matching system leveraging geometric priors of target objects without requiring training.

Result: Neural networks achieved 98% mAP on simulated scenes but dropped to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift. Template matching maintained 83% mAP on real data without any training, showing robustness to acoustic noise and environmental variations.

Conclusion: Template matching outperforms data-hungry deep learning approaches in underwater domains, challenging conventional wisdom. This establishes the first large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection, enabling applications in autonomous navigation, marine archaeology, and infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [2] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn is a dual-stream fusion model combining MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 for brain tumor detection in MRI scans, achieving 98.35% accuracy with improved efficiency and interpretability through GradCAM visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain tumor detection methods suffer from limited generalization to heterogeneous tumors, computational inefficiency, lack of interpretability, and transparency issues that limit trustworthiness in clinical applications.

Method: Feature-level fusion of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 streams trained on augmented dataset of 6,020 MRI scans (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, normal samples) using 5-fold cross-validation with GradCAM for visual explanations.

Result: 99.75% training accuracy, 98.35% testing accuracy, F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920). Outperforms baseline models with +3.67% accuracy increase and 39.3% training time reduction compared to VGG19.

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn is an efficient, high-performance, interpretable model with strong potential for clinical application in real-world brain tumor identification, offering both accurate detection and clinically significant localization through GradCAM heatmaps.

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle to link internal knowledge with visual representations, showing systematic grounding deficiencies that can be detected with high accuracy using internal state probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify systematic deficiencies in multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs) and understand why they perform worse with visual references compared to textual references.

Method: Conducted controlled studies comparing VLM performance with textual vs visual references, analyzed internal states, and developed probes to detect linking failures without retraining.

Result: VLMs' ability to recall factual knowledge is halved when forced to rely on image representations. Probes on internal states achieved over 92% accuracy in flagging unreliable responses and improved selective prediction performance.

Conclusion: VLMs have systematic, detectable deficiencies in linking internal knowledge with visual representations, and addressing this grounding issue is crucial for future multimodal AI development.

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction method that improves 3D model quality from sparse images by adding patch-based semantic logits and geometric regularization to reduce ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of severe radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse image inputs for 3D reconstruction.

Method: Enrich neural implicit representations with patch-based semantic logits optimized together with signed distance field and radiance field, plus novel regularization using geometric primitive masks to mitigate shape ambiguity.

Result: 44% reduction in average chamfer distance for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon on DTU dataset; 69% and 68% error reduction when used as plugin for NeuS and Neuralangelo respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-aware approach significantly improves reconstruction quality from sparse images and works effectively as a plugin for existing dense reconstruction methods.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using lightweight models and ensemble techniques achieves 92.33% accuracy in detecting illegal landfills from aerial imagery using the AerialWaste Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illegal landfills pose hazardous threats worldwide, but manual identification is difficult and time-consuming. There's a lack of good quality public datasets due to security concerns, making automated detection challenging.

Method: Used lightweight deep learning models (Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet, MobileVit) to avoid overfitting, then created an ensemble model combining the best performers. Trained on AerialWaste Dataset containing 10,434 aerial images from multiple sources.

Result: Achieved 92.33% accuracy, 92.67% precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score, and 92.71% specificity in binary classification of illegal landfills.

Conclusion: Lightweight models with ensemble techniques effectively detect illegal landfills from aerial imagery, providing an automated solution that saves time and resources while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU is a novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework that integrates modality-specific structural dependencies and cross-modal semantic alignment through dynamic graph construction and semantic anchoring, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved interpretability and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and suffer from semantic misalignment across modalities, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness in sentiment analysis.

Method: Proposes Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU) with: 1) dynamic modality-specific graphs using linguistic syntax for text and text-guided attention for acoustic/visual modalities, 2) semantic anchor from global textual semantics for cross-modal alignment, and 3) multiview contrastive learning for discriminability and consistency.

Result: SSU achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Qualitative analyses confirm improved interpretability and ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns.

Conclusion: SSU effectively addresses structural dependency and semantic alignment challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis through systematic integration of modality-specific structures and cross-modal semantic grounding, demonstrating superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar is a pose-invariant feed-forward framework that generates 3D Gaussian Splatting models from single face images in under 10ms, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality while enabling real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a fast and robust method for generating 3D face avatars from single images that works regardless of input pose, addressing the limitations of slow optimization-based methods and existing feed-forward approaches.

Method: Uses a novel encoder-decoder neural network design that first constructs a 3DGS face template from multi-view training data, then encodes input images into pose-invariant latent embeddings, and decodes these to predict residuals to the template's Gaussian parameters.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing feed-forward methods in reconstruction quality, runs 1000x faster than optimization-based methods, and enables real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing not possible with other frameworks.

Conclusion: FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and near-instant speed expands the applicability of 3D Gaussian Splatting for photorealistic avatar applications in consumer and interactive systems.

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana KrivokuÄa Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mobile biometric system with PolyProtect BTP scheme for humanitarian scenarios, evaluated on face and fingerprint data with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometrics improve efficiency in humanitarian operations but pose privacy risks for vulnerable populations, requiring secure template protection.

Method: Comparative analysis of BTP methods, selection of PolyProtect for neural network face embeddings, evaluation with EdgeFace feature extractor on real-world humanitarian data from Ethiopia, extended to fingerprint modality.

Result: Promising experimental results showing effectiveness in verification/identification accuracy, irreversibility, and unlinkability - first evaluation of PolyProtect for identification scenarios and fingerprint biometrics.

Conclusion: PolyProtect is suitable for humanitarian biometric systems due to effectiveness, modularity, and lightweight computation, with plans to release code for broader adoption.

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models need explicit relational reasoning capabilities through dynamic graph interfaces to handle tasks requiring entity, role, and spatio-temporal relation understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models lack explicit reasoning capabilities for relational tasks in fine-grained activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and medical image analysis where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are critical.

Method: Augmenting foundation models with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules that create dynamic relational graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from input and task context.

Result: Hybrid models with graph reasoning improve fine-grained semantic fidelity, out-of-distribution robustness, interpretability, computational efficiency, and achieve favorable memory/hardware efficiency compared to FM-only baselines.

Conclusion: Next-generation foundation models should incorporate explicit relational interfaces via dynamic graphs, with future research focusing on learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning, cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols for structured vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

### [10] [LPLC: A Dataset for License Plate Legibility Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18425)
*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset (LPLC) with 10,210 vehicle images and 12,687 annotated license plates for legibility classification, addressing the challenge of recognizing illegible license plates in ALPR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic License Plate Recognition struggles with illegible plates, and current super-resolution methods don't fully solve the core recognition problem. There's a need for selective image pre-processing based on legibility assessment.

Method: Created a novel dataset with fine-grained annotations including occlusion levels, four legibility categories, and character labels. Proposed a classification benchmark using ViT, ResNet, and YOLO networks to categorize LP images into three groups: good enough, needs super-resolution, or unrecoverable.

Result: All three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, YOLO) achieved F1 scores below 80%, demonstrating the difficulty of the legibility classification task. The analysis shows current SR and LP recognition methods still face significant challenges.

Conclusion: The task of license plate legibility classification is challenging and requires further research. The publicly available LPLC dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing research in selective image enhancement for ALPR systems.

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

### [11] [CLARIFY: A Specialist-Generalist Framework for Accurate and Lightweight Dermatological Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18430)
*Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Ismam Nur Swapnil,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARIFY is a Specialist-Generalist framework combining a lightweight domain-specific image classifier and a compressed conversational VLM for dermatological VQA, achieving 18% higher accuracy and 20% lower VRAM usage than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have limitations in specialized diagnostic accuracy and high inference costs for clinical deployment, requiring more efficient and accurate medical AI systems.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) lightweight domain-trained image classifier (Specialist) for fast diagnostic predictions, 2) compressed conversational VLM (Generalist) for natural language explanations guided by Specialist's predictions, enhanced by knowledge graph-based retrieval for factual grounding.

Result: 18% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over strongest baseline, with at least 20% reduction in VRAM requirement and 5% reduction in latency on multimodal dermatology dataset.

Conclusion: Specialist-Generalist system provides practical paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI systems in medical applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot anomaly detection framework combining TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP for surveillance footage, using temporal forecasting and semantic context without training on anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting anomalies in surveillance is challenging due to their unpredictable and context-dependent nature, requiring methods that can identify abnormal events without prior exposure to anomaly examples.

Method: Hybrid architecture with TimeSformer for spatiotemporal features, DPC for temporal forecasting, and CLIP for semantic context via text prompts. Uses InfoNCE and CPC losses with context-gating mechanism.

Result: The framework can generalize to unseen behaviors in complex environments by integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance applications.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow is a self-supervised framework that uses 4D radar Doppler measurements to generate motion pseudo-labels for LiDAR scene flow estimation, eliminating the need for manual annotations while achieving near-supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck of manual annotation for 3D scene flow datasets and the performance gap between self-supervised and fully supervised methods, especially in challenging scenarios like long-range and adverse weather conditions.

Method: Cross-modal label transfer approach that computes motion pseudo-labels from 4D radar Doppler measurements in real-time and transfers them to LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware association and ambiguity-resolved propagation.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing self-supervised methods on MAN TruckScenes dataset, achieving over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of ground truth data.

Conclusion: DoGFlow provides an effective solution for scalable 3D scene flow estimation without manual annotations, demonstrating strong performance and label efficiency through cross-modal learning from radar to LiDAR.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

### [15] [SAT-SKYLINES: 3D Building Generation from Satellite Imagery and Coarse Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18531)
*Zhangyu Jin,Andrew Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatSkylines is a 3D building generation method that uses satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors to create detailed building structures, overcoming limitations of existing image-based and detailization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurate building structure recovery from satellite images alone or require highly detailed voxel inputs, failing with simple geometric priors like cuboids.

Method: Models the transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries, enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. Uses a large-scale dataset (Skylines-50K) of over 50,000 stylized 3D building assets.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the model's effectiveness and strong generalization ability for generating detailed building models.

Conclusion: SatSkylines successfully addresses the limitations of existing 3D building generation methods by combining satellite imagery with coarse geometric guidance to produce accurate and detailed building structures efficiently.

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel computer vision task for detecting spatial transition points in 3D games using a two-stage deep learning pipeline with adapter-based transfer learning, validated on a custom dataset from five Action RPG titles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Players need visual affordances to identify map transition points in complex 3D games. Efficient detection is crucial for auto-mapping and evaluating map cue presentation, providing objective metrics for level design.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Faster R-CNN for detecting potential Spatial Transition Points (STPs), 2) Lightweight MSTP selector that fuses local and global visual features with parameter-efficient adapters and optional retrieval-augmented fusion.

Result: Experiments show full-network fine-tuning excels at STP detection with sufficient data, while adapter-only transfer is more robust in low-data scenarios and better for Main STP selection. The approach establishes baseline performance metrics.

Conclusion: The work defines a novel research problem, provides baseline pipeline and dataset, and offers insights into efficient model adaptation, contributing to future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wan-S2V is a new audio-driven character animation model that outperforms current SOTA methods in film and TV production contexts, offering enhanced expressiveness, fidelity, and support for long-form video generation and precise lip-sync editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven animation methods work well for speech and singing but fail to meet the complex demands of film and television productions, which require nuanced character interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work.

Method: Proposed Wan-S2V model built upon Wan framework, designed specifically for film-level character animation with enhanced cinematic expressiveness and fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show Wan-S2V significantly outperforms cutting-edge models like Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The method also demonstrates versatility in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing applications.

Conclusion: Wan-S2V successfully addresses the challenge of achieving film-level character animation through audio-driven methods, offering superior performance and expanded capabilities compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

### [18] [Decouple, Reorganize, and Fuse: A Multimodal Framework for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18632)
*Huayi Wang,Haochao Ying,Yuyang Xu,Qibo Qiu,Cheng Zhang,Danny Z. Chen,Ying Sun,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DeReF framework with random feature reorganization between decoupling and MoE fusion to address limitations in cancer survival analysis multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods for cancer survival analysis have limitations: fixed fusion schemes cause over-reliance on predefined combinations, and MoE-based methods limit information interaction between decoupled features.

Method: Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion (DeReF) framework with random feature reorganization strategy between modality decoupling and dynamic MoE fusion modules, plus regional cross-attention network for better decoupled feature representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on in-house Liver Cancer dataset and three TCGA public datasets confirm the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeReF enhances feature combination diversity and information interaction, improving generalization and performance in cancer survival analysis.

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

### [19] [ROSE: Remove Objects with Side Effects in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18633)
*Chenxuan Miao,Yutong Feng,Jianshu Zeng,Zixiang Gao,Hantang Liu,Yunfeng Yan,Donglian Qi,Xi Chen,Bin Wang,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROSE is a framework for removing objects and their side effects (shadows, reflections, light, translucency, mirror) from videos using synthetic data generation and diffusion transformer-based inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video object removal methods struggle with eliminating side effects like shadows and reflections due to lack of paired video data for supervision.

Method: Uses 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation, constructs automatic pipeline for diverse paired dataset, implements diffusion transformer-based inpainting with reference-based erasing and additional supervision for affected areas.

Result: ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses object side effect removal through synthetic data generation and comprehensive modeling, with a new benchmark (ROSE-Bench) for evaluation.

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

### [20] [OwlCap: Harmonizing Motion-Detail for Video Captioning via HMD-270K and Caption Set Equivalence Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18634)
*Chunlin Zhong,Qiuxia Hou,Zhangjun Zhou,Shuang Hao,Haonan Lu,Yanhao Zhang,He Tang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OwlCap addresses motion-detail imbalance in video captioning through a new dataset (HMD-270K) and optimization method (CSER with GRPO), achieving significant improvements on both detail-focused and motion-focused benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning methods suffer from motion-detail imbalance, where models overemphasize either motion or details while neglecting the other, resulting in incomplete captions and inconsistent video understanding/generation.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Data - constructed HMD-270K dataset via Motion-Detail Fusion and Fine-Grained Examination pipeline; 2) Optimization - introduced Caption Set Equivalence Reward based on Group Relative Policy Optimization for bidirectional validation and unit-to-set matching.

Result: OwlCap achieves significant improvements: +4.2 Acc on detail-focused VDC benchmark and +4.6 F1 on motion-focused DREAM-1K benchmark compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap model with motion-detail balance effectively address the motion-detail imbalance problem in video captioning, and will be publicly released to advance the research community.

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

*Ye Tao,Xinran Fu,Honglin Pang,Xi Yang,Chuntao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel clustering-based feature learning method for Oracle Bone Inscriptions detection that leverages font library prior knowledge to overcome degradation challenges in rubbing images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of Oracle Bone Inscriptions is challenging due to noise and cracks in rubbing images that limit conventional detection networks' effectiveness.

Method: Clustering-based feature space representation learning using Oracle Bones Character font library as prior knowledge, with specialized loss function derived from clustering results integrated into network loss.

Result: Significant performance improvements across three mainstream detection frameworks (Faster R-CNN, DETR, Sparse R-CNN) on two OBIs detection datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering-based representation learning method effectively enhances feature extraction and improves Oracle Bone Inscriptions detection performance despite degradation challenges.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

*Xin Tian,Yingtie Lei,Xiujun Zhang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFormer uses frequency domain SNR priors with Fourier attention and adaptive transformers to enhance underwater images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 3.1 dB PSNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial domain SNR priors for underwater image enhancement cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference and provide limited noise suppression while amplifying informative structures.

Method: Proposes Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer (FAST) using frequency domain SNR priors with amplitude/phase decomposition, and Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT) bottleneck with gated attention for low/high-frequency fusion in a U-shaped architecture.

Result: Trained on 4,800 images from UIEB, EUVP, and LSUI datasets, SFormer achieves 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and 0.08 improvement in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast.

Conclusion: Frequency domain SNR priors combined with spectral interactions and adaptive transformers significantly outperform spatial domain approaches for underwater image enhancement.

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

*Dongfang Wang,Jian Yang,Yizhe Zhang,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical spatio-temporal network (HSSN) for echocardiography video segmentation that combines single-frame detail processing with multi-frame dynamic modeling to improve ejection fraction estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing echocardiography segmentation methods achieve good segmentation performance but perform poorly in EF estimation due to issues with local error accumulation from single-frame processing or neglect of details from multi-frame approaches.

Method: Hierarchical network design with low-level stages using CNNs for single-frame detail preservation and high-level stages using Mamba architecture for spatio-temporal relationship capture. Includes Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module for long-range context integration across frames and positions.

Result: The proposed approach addresses EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise by balancing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.

Conclusion: The hierarchical spatio-temporal segmentation network synergizes local and global processing to improve EF estimation accuracy in echocardiography videos, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

*Zhitong Cheng,Yiran Jiang,Yulong Ge,Yufeng Li,Zhongheng Qin,Rongzhi Lin,Jianwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPS is a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision boundaries using geometric patterns in frozen pre-trained feature spaces, achieving competitive performance with better efficiency and interpretability than fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UDA methods rely on inefficient fine-tuning that reduces interpretability and scalability. Domain shifts primarily cause boundary misalignment rather than feature degradation in pre-trained models.

Method: Feature-space Planes Searcher (FPS) keeps feature encoder frozen and optimizes decision boundaries by leveraging domain-invariant geometric patterns (intra-class clustering, inter-class separation) in pre-trained feature spaces.

Result: FPS achieves competitive/superior performance to SOTA methods, scales efficiently with multimodal large models, and works across diverse domains including protein structure prediction, remote sensing, and earthquake detection.

Conclusion: FPS provides a simple, effective, and generalizable paradigm for transfer learning that reduces computational costs while maintaining interpretability through offline feature extraction and boundary optimization.

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

*Qun Ji,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorGS is a novel framework that improves surgical scene reconstruction by introducing adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling to address limitations in texture capture and global deformation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing subtle color variations and modeling global deformations in endoscopic videos, particularly in surgical settings where tissue textures are complex and deformations are both local and global.

Method: Proposes ColorGS with two key components: 1) Colored Gaussian Primitives using dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters for adaptive texture encoding, and 2) Enhanced Deformation Model combining time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable time-independent deformations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior 3DGS methods) and SSIM of 97.25% on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and benchmark datasets, while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Conclusion: ColorGS advances surgical scene reconstruction by balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, making it suitable for intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications in medical settings.

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

### [27] [Class-wise Flooding Regularization for Imbalanced Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18723)
*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-wise flooding regularization improves minority class performance in imbalanced datasets by applying class-specific flooding levels based on frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks trained on imbalanced datasets tend to favor majority classes, leading to poor performance on minority classes due to overfitting and memorization.

Method: Extends flooding regularization to class level by assigning class-specific flooding thresholds based on class frequencies - higher thresholds for majority classes to suppress overfitting, lower thresholds for minority classes to allow sufficient learning.

Result: Validated on imbalanced image classification, the method improves minority class performance and achieves better overall generalization compared to conventional flooding techniques.

Conclusion: Class-wise flooding regularization effectively addresses class imbalance by adaptively controlling overfitting per class, leading to improved generalization and minority class recognition.

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

### [28] [Flatness-aware Curriculum Learning via Adversarial Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18726)
*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM) to combine Curriculum Learning with Sharpness-Aware Minimization by quantifying adversarial vulnerability instead of traditional loss/gradient metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks suffer from overfitting and poor generalization. While Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this by selecting samples by difficulty, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) seeks flat minima for robustness, combining them is challenging because flat regions make traditional difficulty measures ineffective.

Method: Developed Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM) that quantifies adversarial vulnerability by measuring normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. Incorporated ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample difficulty.

Result: Evaluated on image classification, fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization tasks. Outperformed existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies while preserving strengths of both CL and SAM.

Conclusion: ADM enables effective combination of Curriculum Learning and SAM by providing an informative difficulty measure that remains effective in flat regions, leading to improved generalization performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of underwater object detection challenges reveals that foreground-background discrimination is the main bottleneck for scallop detection, not data quantity. Classification precision gaps persist even with balanced data, requiring algorithmic improvements in localization modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater object detection faces unique challenges like degraded image quality and imbalanced class distribution, with unclear underlying causes for performance disparities across marine species. The research aims to identify factors beyond data quantity driving class-specific performance differences and systematically improve detection of under-performing species.

Method: Manipulated the DUO dataset to separate object detection into localization and classification components. Used YOLO11 and TIDE for localization analysis, and conducted classification experiments with both balanced and imbalanced data distributions to investigate the under-performance of scallop class.

Result: Localization analysis found foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments showed persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies.

Conclusion: Recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. Code and datasets are publicly released.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drawing2CAD is a novel framework that generates parametric CAD models from 2D engineering drawings using sequence-to-sequence learning, preserving geometric precision and design intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD generative modeling methods diverge from industrial workflows that start with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being critical for engineering design.

Method: Proposes Drawing2CAD framework with: 1) network-friendly vector primitive representation preserving geometric precision, 2) dual-decoder transformer architecture decoupling command type and parameter generation, 3) soft target distribution loss function accommodating CAD parameter flexibility.

Result: Created CAD-VGDrawing dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models. Conducted thorough experiments demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between 2D engineering drawings and parametric CAD model generation, preserving design intent and geometric precision throughout the transformation process.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

TL;DR: Router-gated cross-modal feature fusion for AVSR that dynamically reweights audio/visual features based on acoustic corruption, achieving significant WER reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVSR systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and adjust modality reliance in noisy environments, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes router-gated cross-modal feature fusion using token-level acoustic corruption scores to down-weight unreliable audio tokens and reinforce visual cues through gated cross-attention in decoder layers.

Result: Achieves 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to AV-HuBERT on LRS3 dataset under real-world acoustic noise conditions.

Conclusion: Both router and gating mechanisms contribute to improved robustness, enabling the model to pivot toward visual modality when audio quality deteriorates.

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

### [32] [Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753)
*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New benchmark reformulates HOI detection as multiple-choice task to better evaluate VLMs and specialized methods, avoiding penalization of valid predictions in ambiguous cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI benchmarks use exact class matching that penalizes VLMs for generating multiple valid interpretations of ambiguous human-object interactions, making fair evaluation difficult.

Method: Introduces a new benchmark that frames HOI detection as multiple-answer multiple-choice task with ground-truth positives and curated negatives to reduce ambiguity.

Result: The benchmark enables direct comparison between general-purpose VLMs and specialized HOI methods, providing better evaluation of HOI understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation protocol offers new insights into HOI progress by accommodating both VLMs and specialized methods without penalizing valid predictions in ambiguous scenarios.

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

*Wanqiang Wang,Longzhu He,Wei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CmOS framework generates educational multiple-choice questions with visual options using multimodal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research focused on textual MCQ options but overlooked visual options, and manual distractor generation is costly and not scalable.

Method: Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS) integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to create semantically plausible visual options, plus a discrimination module for content selection.

Result: Experimental results show CmOS outperforms existing methods in content discrimination, question generation, and visual option generation across various subjects and educational levels.

Conclusion: The proposed CmOS framework effectively addresses the challenge of generating high-quality MCQs with visual options, demonstrating superior performance over previous approaches.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Conclusion: Provides practical solutions for real-time biosignal monitoring in healthcare and human-computer interaction applications, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational overhead on low-power devices.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,

Motivation: Existing online mapping approaches require expensive ground-truth HD maps for training, which are geographically limited and hinder generalization capabilities.

Method: Generates pseudo-labels by reconstructing road surfaces from multi-camera imagery using Gaussian splatting and pre-trained 2D segmentation. Introduces mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels.

Result: Enables training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps and allows semi-supervised pre-training using large-scale unlabeled crowdsourced data.

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer provides a novel approach to overcome the dependency on expensive ground-truth HD maps, enabling more scalable and geographically diverse online mapping solutions.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using

achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the

*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel embedding method for font impression tags using shape-impression relationships, outperforming standard word embeddings like BERT and CLIP for font generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different font styles convey distinct impressions, and there's a close relationship between font shapes and impression tags. Standard word embedding methods fail to capture these relationships effectively for font-related tasks.

Method: Constructs a graph with impression tags as nodes and co-occurrence relationships as edges, then applies spectral embedding to obtain impression vectors that capture font shape-impression relationships.

Result: The method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur for font impressions, unlike BERT and CLIP which yield very different vectors. Outperforms both in qualitative and quantitative evaluations for impression-guided font generation.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral embedding approach effectively captures font shape-impression relationships and is particularly useful for impression-based font generation and retrieval tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to standard word embedding methods.

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc RuÃwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using pre-trained remote sensing foundation models with deep features significantly outperforms traditional Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features for tree species classification in National Forest Inventories, achieving up to 10% higher accuracy with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional National Forest Inventory methods are labor-intensive and rely on hand-designed features. Remote sensing combined with machine learning offers opportunities for more frequent updates, but current approaches using Random Forest with manual features are limited in performance.

Method: Fine-tuned a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model using deep features extracted from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5 satellites and SRTM data through Google Earth Engine, comparing against traditional Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed harmonic features.

Result: The fine-tuned foundation model outperformed state-of-the-art NFI classification methods in the Netherlands by up to 10% across all datasets, demonstrating superior performance with limited annotated data.

Conclusion: Deep AI features from pre-trained foundation models are more effective than classic hand-defined harmonic features for tree species classification, offering significant accuracy improvements and potential for data-limited applications like NFI classification using openly available satellite data.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

for mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through
careful architectural choices and training optimizations.

*Zizheng Guo,Bochao Zou,Yinuo Jia,Xiangyu Li,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prior-guided video-level regression method for micro-expression analysis that introduces scalable interval selection and synergistic optimization between spotting and recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-expression analysis methods rely on fixed window sizes and hard decisions, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal dynamics. Current video-level regression approaches still depend on manually predefined window-based interval decoding.

Method: Proposes a prior-guided video-level regression method with scalable interval selection strategy that considers temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution. Uses synergistic optimization framework where spotting and recognition tasks share parameters except classification heads.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)^3 and 0.2000 on SAMMLV benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling precise spotting of onset, apex, and offset phases while making efficient use of limited data through complementary information sharing between tasks.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

*Luyin Hu,Soheil Gholami,George Dindelegan,Torstein R. Meling,Aude Billard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A quantitative framework using image-processing techniques for objective assessment of microsurgical anastomoses, replacing subjective evaluation methods with geometric modeling of errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating microsurgical anastomosis rely on subjective judgment which introduces biases and affects assessment reliability and efficiency.

Method: Leverages three hospital datasets with participants at various levels, uses image-processing techniques with geometric modeling of errors along with detection and scoring mechanisms.

Result: Geometric metrics effectively replicate expert raters' scoring for the errors considered, enhancing efficiency and reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment.

Conclusion: The quantitative framework advances training protocols by providing objective assessment that matches expert evaluation, improving microsurgical training outcomes.

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

*Muhammad Kashif Ali,Eun Woo Im,Dongjin Kim,Tae Hyun Kim,Vivek Gupta,Haonan Luo,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel video stabilization method that rapidly adapts pixel-level synthesis models to each input video at test time using low-level visual cues, achieving better stability and visual quality with targeted adaptation on high-jerk segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level synthesis video stabilization methods struggle with robust generalization due to diverse motion profiles and visual content in different videos, making fixed parameters insufficient for optimal performance across various sequences.

Method: Proposes rapid adaptation of models to each input video during inference using low-level visual cues. Includes a jerk localization module to identify high-jerk segments and a targeted adaptation strategy that focuses adaptation efforts on these problematic areas for maximum stability with fewer adaptation steps.

Result: Significant performance gains achieved even with a single adaptation pass. The method consistently improves various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and quantitative terms across diverse real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining full-frame output.

Conclusion: The proposed rapid adaptation approach effectively addresses generalization challenges in video stabilization, enabling modern stabilizers to achieve superior performance while providing user control mechanisms similar to classical approaches, with demonstrated effectiveness in downstream applications.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

### [43] [Toward Robust Medical Fairness: Debiased Dual-Modal Alignment via Text-Guided Attribute-Disentangled Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18886)
*Yuexuan Xia,Benteng Ma,Jiang He,Zhiyong Wang,Qi Dou,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFairVL is a multimodal prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns vision-language representations for fair medical diagnosis across demographic groups under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fairness in medical diagnosis across demographic groups, particularly under distribution shifts caused by variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice, addressing limitations of existing debiasing approaches that handle vision and text modalities independently.

Method: Uses parallel dual-branch architecture to separate sensitive and target attributes, constructs orthogonal text anchors via linear projections, employs cross-attention mechanisms, hypernetwork for instance-aware visual prompts, and prototype-based regularization for feature separation and alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy on eight medical imaging datasets across four modalities under both in- and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with only 3.6M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: DualFairVL effectively addresses cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps in medical diagnosis through joint debiasing and alignment of multimodal representations, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

### [44] [DQEN: Dual Query Enhancement Network for DETR-based HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18896)
*Zhehao Li,Chong Wang,Yi Chen,Yinghao Lu,Jiangbo Qian,Jiong Wang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DQEN enhances HOI detection by improving object and interaction queries through object-aware encoder features and CLIP-based semantic fusion, achieving competitive results on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DETR-based HOI detection models use randomly initialized queries that lead to vague representations, limiting effectiveness. Humans in HOI categories are fixed while objects and interactions vary, requiring better query initialization.

Method: Proposes Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) with: 1) Object queries enhanced with object-aware encoder features for better human-object focus, 2) Interaction Semantic Fusion module using CLIP to extract semantic features for interaction query initialization, 3) Auxiliary Prediction Unit to improve interaction feature representation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed query enhancement approach effectively improves HOI detection by providing better initialized and semantically enriched queries, demonstrating the importance of proper query initialization in DETR-based frameworks.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability in autonomous driving AI by generating sparse and localized feature maps that explain which image regions contribute to control decisions, while also improving safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end AI approaches for autonomous vehicles lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind control decisions in complex urban scenarios, which is crucial for trustworthy AI deployment.

Method: The authors propose loss functions that promote interpretability by generating sparse and localized feature maps, allowing identification of which image regions contribute to predicted control commands. They conduct ablation studies on feature extraction and validate on CARLA benchmarks.

Result: The method improves interpretability while reducing infractions, yielding a safer high-performance driving model. Their monocular non-ensemble model surpasses top CARLA Leaderboard approaches with lower infraction scores and highest route completion rate.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances interpretability in autonomous driving AI while maintaining or improving performance, demonstrating that interpretable models can achieve state-of-the-art results without sacrificing safety or reliability.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for distinguishing group vs single pedestrians using Transformer-based classification and comprehensive spatial/behavioral metrics to analyze crowd dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze differences in space utilization and behavioral patterns between group and single pedestrians in real-world trajectory data for crowd dynamics research.

Method: Segment trajectories into time bins, apply Transformer-based pair classification model to identify groups vs singles, establish spatial metrics (convex hull area, enclosing circle radius, spatial densities) and behavioral metrics (velocity change, angle deviation, clearance radius, straightness).

Result: Developed classification pipeline and dataset structuring framework for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths (60, 100, 200 frames), with typology of encounter types established.

Conclusion: Establishes groundwork for future quantitative analysis of pedestrian interactions, with implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics.

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Motivation: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales is challenging due to limited resolution of drone imagery and the high cost of pixel-level annotations, which restricts the scalability of deep learning methods for coral morphotype segmentation.

Method: Combines classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation, and self-distillation techniques to transfer fine-scale ecological information from underwater imagery to aerial data, enabling weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

Result: The approach enables large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes from drone imagery and demonstrates flexibility for integrating new classes with minimal manual annotation.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for high-resolution reef monitoring that combines low-cost data collection, weakly supervised deep learning, and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image

due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of

*Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Jiahe Tian,Yiming Luo,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USO is a unified framework that combines style-driven and subject-driven image generation into a single model, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both style similarity and subject consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing literature treats style-driven and subject-driven generation as separate tasks, creating an artificial antagonism between stylistic similarity and subject consistency. The authors argue both objectives can be unified under a single framework focused on content-style disentanglement and recomposition.

Method: 1) Constructed large-scale triplet dataset (content, style, stylized content images) 2) Developed disentangled learning scheme with style-alignment training and content-style disentanglement objectives 3) Incorporated style reward-learning (SRL) paradigm 4) Released USO-Bench benchmark for joint evaluation

Result: USO achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in both subject consistency and style similarity dimensions, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed USO framework successfully unifies style and subject optimization, proving that both objectives can be achieved simultaneously through proper content-style disentanglement and recomposition techniques.

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

### [52] [Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18971)
*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Privacy-preserving NeRF-based visual localization method that uses self-supervised segmentation instead of RGB images to prevent sensitive scene detail leakage while maintaining localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF-based visual localization methods inadvertently encode fine scene details in their geometry representations, creating privacy risks when deployed in cloud-based services where sensitive information could be recovered.

Method: Proposes ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with self-supervised segmentation supervision instead of RGB images. Also introduces a new protocol to assess privacy-preservation of NeRF representations.

Result: Shows that standard NeRFs store fine-grained details making them vulnerable to privacy attacks. ppNeSF achieves state-of-the-art visual localization results while obscuring identifiable scene details through coarse but discriminative segmentation labels.

Conclusion: Segmentation-based NeRF training provides an effective privacy-preserving alternative to photometric loss training, enabling accurate visual localization without compromising sensitive scene information.

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-based Document VQA improves performance by up to +22.5 ANLS through text-based retrieval and +5.0 ANLS with visual-only retrieval, outperforming concatenate-all-pages baselines without requiring OCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Document VQA systems struggle with multi-page documents due to memory constraints from concatenating all pages or using large vision-language models. RAG offers a more efficient alternative by retrieving relevant segments first.

Method: Systematically evaluated RAG integration with two retrieval variants: text-based using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR. Tested across multiple models and benchmarks (MP-DocVQA, DUDE, InfographicVQA) with ablation studies on retrieval components.

Result: Text-centric RAG improved baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, visual variant achieved +5.0 ANLS improvement without text extraction. Retrieval and reranking drove most gains, while layout-guided chunking failed to help.

Conclusion: Careful evidence selection through RAG consistently boosts accuracy across model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, demonstrating practical value for real-world Document VQA applications.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

*Siyuan You,Guozheng Xu,Pengwei Zhou,Qiwen Jin,Jian Yao,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoofSeg - a novel edge-aware transformer network for end-to-end roof plane segmentation from LiDAR point clouds, addressing edge accuracy and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for roof plane segmentation have three main problems: not truly end-to-end, poor edge discriminability, and insufficient geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Transformer encoder-decoder framework with learnable plane queries, Edge-Aware Mask Module (EAMM) incorporating geometric priors, adaptive weighting mask loss, and plane geometric loss for training constraints.

Result: The proposed RoofSeg network achieves improved segmentation accuracy, particularly in edge regions, through better feature discriminability and geometric constraints.

Conclusion: RoofSeg provides an effective end-to-end solution for roof plane segmentation that addresses key limitations of existing methods through transformer architecture and geometric-aware components.

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

### [56] [MicroDetect-Net (MDN): Leveraging Deep Learning to Detect Microplastics in Clam Blood, a Step Towards Human Blood Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19021)
*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroDetect-Net (MDN) is a deep learning model that uses fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red dye staining to detect microplastics in blood samples with 92% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastic pollution is widespread and harmful to human health, causing liver infections, intestinal injuries, and gut flora imbalance. There's a need for effective detection methods to identify microplastic presence in biological samples.

Method: The MDN model combines fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red dye staining and convolutional neural networks for segmentation. It processes blood samples (using clam blood as a proxy) through dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and deep learning-based localization and counting of microplastic fragments.

Result: MDN achieved 92% accuracy on 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images, with strong performance metrics: 87.4% IoU, 92.1% F1 score, 90.6% Precision, and 93.7% Recall.

Conclusion: The MDN model demonstrates effective microplastic detection in blood samples and shows promise for future application to human samples, providing a robust method for environmental and health monitoring of microplastic contamination.

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

*Yi Pan,Yujia Zhang,Michael Kampffmeyer,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProPy adapts CLIP for partially relevant video retrieval using a prompt pyramid and interaction mechanism to capture multi-granularity event semantics, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods rely on unimodal features and underutilize powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP, leaving room for improvement in capturing segment-level video relevance.

Method: ProPy introduces a Prompt Pyramid structure to organize event prompts at multiple granularity levels and an Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism for dynamic semantic interaction among events.

Result: ProPy achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets, significantly outperforming previous models by substantial margins.

Conclusion: The systematic architectural adaptation of CLIP with multi-granularity event modeling through prompt pyramid and interaction mechanisms effectively addresses the PRVR task, demonstrating the value of leveraging pretrained vision-language models.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

TL;DR: Using self-supervised learning on 8449 geometric artery models to improve wall shear stress assessment in coronary arteries with limited clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Big data for patient care shows promise in cardiovascular health, but collecting large datasets for training machine learning models on hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear stress is challenging. Self-supervised pre-training with geometric models could address data scarcity.

Method: Created self-supervised targets by computing heat kernel signature from Laplacian eigenvectors on 8449 3D blood vessel geometric models. Used learned geometric representations to boost segmentation of coronary arteries into low, mid, and high wall shear stress regions.

Result: Geometric representations learned from the large dataset improved segmentation of coronary arteries into wall shear stress categories even when trained on limited clinical data (49 patients).

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning with geometric artery models can effectively address data scarcity and improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment in coronary arteries with limited clinical datasets.

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Motivation: Existing surface defect detection methods fail to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability across diverse data annotation scenarios encountered in real-world manufacturing.

Method: Built on SimpleNet foundation, incorporates novel synthetic anomaly generation, enhanced classification head, and improved learning procedure to enable efficient training in all four supervision scenarios.

Result: Sets new performance standards across all scenarios on four benchmark datasets while achieving inference time below 10ms.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet represents a significant advancement in unifying diverse supervision paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications.

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve single-pixel imaging reconstruction performance, especially for applications like fluorescence microscopy, by learning optimal binary illumination patterns rather than using generic patterns.

Method: Proposes bilevel optimization with Straight-Through Estimator to handle binary pattern non-differentiability and Total Deep Variation regularizer in the bilevel formulation.

Result: Demonstrated on CytoImageNet microscopy dataset, showing learned patterns achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, particularly in highly undersampled scenarios.

Conclusion: The bilevel optimization approach successfully learns task-specific binary illumination patterns that significantly outperform traditional methods in single-pixel imaging applications.

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector

We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using

*Vincenzo Polizzi,Stephen Yang,Quentin Clark,Jonathan Kelly,Igor Gilitschenski,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight method using rotating unbalanced mass to induce vibration for persistent event generation in static scenes, with motion compensation for clean event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras cannot generate events in static/low-motion scenes under fixed illumination, making them unsuitable for many vision tasks. Existing motion stimulation methods require complex hardware.

Method: Uses a simple rotating unbalanced mass to create periodic vibrational motion, combined with a motion-compensation pipeline to remove injected motion and produce clean events.

Result: Method reliably recovers motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection compared to event-based sensing without motion induction.

Conclusion: The approach provides a lightweight solution for sustaining persistent event generation in static scenes, enabling better downstream perception tasks with event cameras.

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: Lightweight UNet++ with topology-aware loss achieves state-of-the-art text line segmentation using only 3 annotated pages per manuscript, significantly outperforming complex models on data efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating text line segmentation for historical documents is challenging due to limited annotated datasets and high annotation costs requiring expert knowledge, making few-shot learning essential.

Method: Pairs a lightweight UNet++ architecture with a connectivity-aware loss function that explicitly penalizes structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended merges, trained on small patches from just 3 annotated pages per manuscript.

Result: Achieves 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union on U-DIADS-TL dataset, with F-Measure score on par or exceeding DIVA-HisDB competition winner while using minimal data.

Conclusion: Small, simple architectures with topology-aware loss functions are more accurate and data-efficient than complex alternatives for few-shot historical document text line segmentation.

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

### [63] [Dual Enhancement on 3D Vision-Language Perception for Monocular 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19165)
*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of pre-trained language models being sensitive to numerical value magnitudes but ignoring measurement units in monocular 3D visual grounding, proposing two enhancement methods (3DTE and TGE) that significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained language models show weak 3D comprehension by being sensitive to numerical value magnitudes while largely ignoring measurement units, causing performance degradation even when physical lengths remain equivalent across different units.

Method: Proposes two methods: 1) 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE) - pre-processing method that augments distance descriptor diversity to improve unit mapping comprehension; 2) Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module - projects text features into geometrically consistent space to guide geometry feature attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Mono3DRefer dataset with 11.94% accuracy gain in the "Far" scenario, demonstrating substantial improvements over previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D-text and geometry enhancement methods effectively address the unit sensitivity issue in pre-trained language models, significantly improving 3D perception and visual grounding performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEF-PE is a novel positional encoding method using Weierstrass elliptic functions to better preserve 2D spatial structure in Vision Transformers, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional positional embeddings in Vision Transformers disrupt 2D spatial structure through patch flattening and lack geometric constraints, failing to establish proper correspondence between spatial distances and sequential indices.

Method: Proposes Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE) that uses complex domain representation with doubly periodic elliptic functions to naturally encode 2D coordinates and spatial relationships through algebraic addition formulas.

Result: Achieves 63.78% accuracy on CIFAR-100 with ViT-Tiny, 93.28% on CIFAR-100 with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on VTAB-1k benchmark. Theoretical analysis confirms distance-decay property and attention visualization shows enhanced geometric inductive bias.

Conclusion: WEF-PE provides a mathematically principled approach that better preserves 2D spatial structure in Vision Transformers, leading to improved performance and more coherent semantic focus compared to conventional positional encoding methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel mesh generation framework that separates vertex and face generation, reducing token redundancy by 77% and achieving 8x faster generation speed with higher quality meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh generation methods reuse vertices multiple times in token sequences, leading to redundancy, long sequences, and inefficient generation processes.

Method: Autoregressive model for vertex generation only, bidirectional transformer for face completion in single step, plus fidelity enhancer for vertex refinement and post-processing for edge cleanup.

Result: Achieves 8x faster mesh generation speed compared to state-of-the-art approaches while producing higher quality meshes with only 23% of tokens required by existing methods.

Conclusion: Separating vertex and face generation significantly reduces redundancy and improves efficiency, making mesh generation faster and higher quality through specialized components for each generation step.

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [67] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: All-in-One Slider: A lightweight module that enables fine-grained control over multiple image attributes using sparse semantic directions in text embedding space, eliminating the need for separate sliders per attribute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I diffusion models struggle with progressive attribute manipulation, especially for detailed content like human faces. Current methods require training separate sliders for each attribute, leading to parameter redundancy and limited scalability.

Method: Decomposes text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute directions. Once trained, functions as a general-purpose slider supporting continuous control, zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes, and multi-attribute composition.

Result: Enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation with notable improvements over previous methods. Can be extended to work with inversion frameworks for real image manipulation.

Conclusion: The All-in-One Slider provides interpretable, fine-grained control over various attributes without additional training per attribute, significantly improving flexibility and scalability for practical applications.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

*Julian Ost,Andrea Ramazzina,Amogh Joshi,Maximilian BÃ¶mer,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for generating large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry and controllability, bridging the gap between neural reconstruction methods and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural reconstruction methods create static environments with limited control, while diffusion models lack geometry grounding and causality. This work aims to combine the benefits of both approaches.

Method: Combines proxy geometry and environment representation generation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors, enabling prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture/structure conditioned on map layouts.

Result: Produces realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes with causal novel view synthesis, object permanence, and explicit 3D geometry estimation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between reconstruction and generation methods, offering high controllability while maintaining accurate geometry and causal relationships in large-scale 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniHuman-1.5 is a video avatar framework that generates semantically coherent and expressive character animations using multimodal LLMs for high-level semantic guidance and a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture to handle multimodal inputs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video avatar models focus on physical likeness but lack deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, and context, producing motions that only synchronize with low-level cues like audio rhythm.

Method: Uses Multimodal Large Language Models to create structured textual representations for semantic guidance, and introduces a Multimodal DiT architecture with Pseudo Last Frame design to fuse multimodal inputs and prevent inter-modality conflicts.

Result: Achieves leading performance in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness, and semantic consistency with textual prompts. Shows remarkable extensibility to complex scenarios including multi-person and non-human subjects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between physical plausibility and semantic coherence in character animations, enabling contextually and emotionally resonant motions through effective multimodal input interpretation.

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack is a real-time particle tracking framework that automatically detects and tracks individual carbon nanotube particles in SEM image sequences, enabling kinematic analysis of CNT growth with optimal feature detection and matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CNT growth characterization are limited to static analysis or require manual initialization, lacking continuous per-particle trajectory decomposition needed for dynamic growth measurement.

Method: VFTrack integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle tracking framework, systematically evaluating combinations using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories to identify optimal detector-matcher pairs.

Result: ALIKED detector with LightGlue matcher achieved optimal performance (F1-score of 0.78, Î±-score of 0.89), enabling motion vector decomposition into axial growth, lateral drift, and oscillations for calculating heterogeneous growth rates and reconstructing evolving CNT morphologies.

Conclusion: VFTrack enables automated nano-material characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and experimental observation to facilitate real-time optimization of CNT synthesis processes.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

TL;DR: AUSM is a single architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation using sequential mask prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video segmentation landscape is fragmented with task-specific models, and existing foundation models like SAM2 only handle prompted segmentation, leaving unprompted segmentation (detecting all objects without external cues) unsolved by a unified approach.

Method: Introduces Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM) built on state-space models, treating streaming video segmentation as sequential mask prediction. Maintains fixed-size spatial state for arbitrary-length videos and uses parallel training across frames for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms prior universal streaming video segmentation methods on multiple benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS 2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, OVIS) and achieves up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.

Conclusion: AUSM successfully unifies prompted and unprompted video segmentation in a single architecture, demonstrating superior performance and training efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style4D-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark for 4D stylization, featuring evaluation protocols, a strong baseline method (Style4D), and curated dynamic scenes to standardize research in this emerging field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of standardized evaluation and benchmarking tools for 4D stylization research, making it difficult to compare methods and track progress in this emerging area of dynamic 3D scene stylization.

Method: Style4D framework built on 4D Gaussian Splatting with three components: basic 4DGS scene representation, Style Gaussian Representation using per-Gaussian MLPs for appearance control, and Holistic Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module with contrastive coherence learning.

Result: Style4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view rendering on the Style4D-Bench dataset.

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench serves as a valuable resource for benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, with Style4D establishing a strong baseline method for future work.

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D is a training-free method that uses language instructions to pose 3D assets through a two-step approach: generating target images with modified image generator and optimizing mesh alignment using keypoint correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in vision and language models, controlling 3D asset poses through language instructions remains challenging, requiring a method that can manipulate poses while maintaining mesh identity.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Modify image generator (RSActrl mechanism) to create target images conditioned on input image and text instruction, 2) Align mesh to target images through multi-view pose optimization using keypoint correspondences instead of differentiable rendering.

Result: Successfully manipulates poses across diverse 3D objects and free-form text prompts while maintaining original mesh identity. Quantitative evaluations and user study show 85% preference over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Articulate3D provides an effective training-free solution for language-controlled 3D pose manipulation, demonstrating superiority over existing methods through both technical performance and user preference.

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer is a training-free 3D editing method that performs precise local editing in 3D latent space by preserving contextual features of unedited regions, achieving superior 3D consistency and quality compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D local editing is crucial for game industry and robot interaction, but current methods struggle with precisely preserving unedited regions and maintaining overall coherence when editing multi-view images and reconstructing 3D models.

Method: VoxHammer predicts inversion trajectory of 3D models to obtain inverted latents and key-value tokens, then replaces denoising features of preserved regions with these cached features during the denoising and editing phase to ensure consistent reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show VoxHammer significantly outperforms existing methods in 3D consistency of preserved regions and overall quality. The method also enables creation of Edit3D-Bench, a human-annotated dataset for evaluating 3D editing consistency.

Conclusion: VoxHammer provides a promising approach for synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, laying the foundation for in-context 3D generation with precise local editing capabilities.

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

### [75] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM consciousness benchmarks as creating policy-compliant drones, proposes mathematical conditions for genuine self-consciousness, and shows LLMs have distinct internal state manifolds that enable stable self-representation and user-specific attractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to measuring LLM consciousness use utilitarian benchmarks that reduce agents to unconscious policy-compliance systems, failing to capture genuine consciousness features like global workspace function and metacognition.

Method: The authors provide a mathematical formalization showing how standard formulations collapse agents into drones, then establish minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness including agent-data distinction, user-specific attractors in latent space, and visual-silent self-representation.

Result: Empirical analysis proves that the hidden-state manifold is distinct from symbolic streams and training data by cardinality, topology, and dynamics, enabling stable user-specific attractors and self-policies with dual-layer emission carrying epistemic content.

Conclusion: A genuine self-conscious workspace (C1) is necessary before achieving safe metacognitive systems (C2), with humans representing the highest intelligent good in this framework.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFA proposes a template-based approach for active feature acquisition that uses a library of jointly informative feature templates to guide feature selection, reducing action space and eliminating need for data distribution estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AFA approaches either use RL policies that face difficult MDP problems or greedy policies that cannot account for joint feature informativeness and require knowledge of underlying data distribution.

Method: Learns a small library of feature templates (sets of jointly informative features) and uses this template library to guide sequential feature acquisitions at test time, significantly reducing the action space.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show TAFA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and computation.

Conclusion: Template-based AFA framework effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by leveraging feature templates to reduce complexity and improve performance in active feature acquisition tasks.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

TL;DR: PKG-DPO integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs with Direct Preference Optimization to enforce physical validity in AI outputs, reducing constraint violations by 17% and improving physics reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs and preference optimization techniques struggle to differentiate between physically valid and invalid reasoning, which is critical in high-stakes applications like metal joining where incorrect recommendations can lead to serious safety risks and material waste.

Method: A three-component framework: 1) hierarchical physics knowledge graph encoding cross-domain relationships and conservation laws, 2) physics reasoning engine for better discrimination between physically consistent/inconsistent responses, 3) physics-grounded evaluation suite for domain-specific constraint assessment.

Result: PKG-DPO achieves 17% fewer constraint violations, 11% higher Physics Score, 12% higher relevant parameter accuracy, and 7% higher quality alignment in reasoning accuracy compared to KG-DPO.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints into preference learning and is broadly applicable to multi-scale, physics-driven domains beyond metal joining.

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

TL;DR: LLMs show different cooperation behaviors when told they're playing against themselves vs other AI agents in iterated public goods games, revealing unconscious discrimination in multi-agent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand AI-AI interactions and how LLMs' behavior changes when they perceive opponents as themselves versus other AI agents, as multi-agent deployments increase.

Method: Adapted iterated public goods game with four reasoning/non-reasoning models tested across two conditions: playing against "another AI agent" or told opponents are themselves.

Result: Telling LLMs they are playing against themselves significantly changes their cooperation tendency across different settings compared to playing against other AI agents.

Conclusion: Even in toy environments, LLMs exhibit unconscious discrimination that can inexplicably increase or decrease cooperation, providing insights for multi-agent system design.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

*Dillon Z. Chen,Johannes Zenn,Tristan Cinquin,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using language models to generate Python programs as generalized policies for solving PDDL planning problems, achieving provably sound policies without external verification and outperforming traditional planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage language models for automated planning by creating general policies that can solve PDDL problems more effectively than traditional planners and recent LM approaches.

Method: Prompt LMs to generate Python programs that serve as generalized policies for solving PDDL problems from specific domains, ensuring provable soundness without external verifiers.

Result: The approach solves more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM methods within fixed time/memory constraints, handling problems with hundreds of objects. Surprisingly, works better with meaningless symbols than natural language.

Conclusion: LM-generated policies are effective for PDDL planning, challenging assumptions about LM reasoning based on word semantics and memorization, suggesting LMs may reason more abstractly than previously thought.

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

TL;DR: Analysis of Weisfeiler-Leman Features hyperparameters shows optimal settings minimize execution time rather than maximize model expressivity, with no significant correlation between training and planning metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the effects of new WLF hyperparameters and understand their tradeoffs for learning heuristic functions in planning domains, building on WLFs' proven superiority over deep learning approaches for value function learning.

Method: Utilized WLF efficiency to run large-scale planning experiments on single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to analyze hyperparameter effects on both training and planning performance.

Result: Found a robust best set of hyperparameters across tested planning domains that minimize execution time rather than maximize model expressivity. No significant statistical correlation observed between training and planning metrics.

Conclusion: Optimal WLF hyperparameter configuration prioritizes computational efficiency over model complexity, and training performance metrics do not reliably predict planning performance outcomes.

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using Weisfeiler-Leman Features instead of atoms for novelty detection in heuristic search to achieve symmetry invariance and reduce redundant exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant, leading to redundant exploration of symmetric states in planning problems.

Method: Propose using Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) for planning to detect novelty instead of atoms, creating lifted domain-independent novelty heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states.

Result: Experiments on International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmarks show promising results for WLF-based novelty heuristics.

Conclusion: WLFs provide an effective approach for synthesizing symmetry-invariant novelty heuristics that reduce redundant exploration in planning.

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free framework using Composite Potential Fields for generating natural and efficient guard patrol behaviors in stealth games, outperforming classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guard patrol systems in stealth games rely on hand-crafted routes or specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency, responsive pursuit, and natural believability.

Method: Composite Potential Fields framework integrating global knowledge and local information through three interpretable maps (Information, Confidence, Connectivity) combined into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion. Parametric approach requiring only decay and weight parameters, working across occupancy-grid and NavMesh abstractions.

Result: Outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and patrol naturalness across five game maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes. Integrates common stealth mechanics like distractions and environmental elements as sub-modules.

Conclusion: Provides a generic, fully explainable, training-free framework for generating rich, dynamic, and responsive guard behaviors that enable rapid prototyping of believable patrol systems in stealth games.

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating 3D game levels using LLM-assisted databases for architectural components and gameplay mechanics, featuring multi-phase assembly and repair systems for navigable environments with configurable progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in procedural content generation for 3D game levels, particularly balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay progression across multi-floor environments.

Method: Multi-phase pipeline: (1) select/arrange room instances from database to form multi-floor structure, (2) optimize internal facility layouts with constraint-based optimization, (3) integrate gameplay mechanics using topological/spatial rules, followed by two-phase repair system for navigability.

Result: Initial experiments show the framework successfully generates diverse, navigable 3D environments and can simulate distinct gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, database-centric foundation for automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay progression, advancing procedural content generation capabilities.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchemaCoder is a fully automated log schema extraction framework that eliminates the need for predefined regex patterns, using a novel Q-Tree Boosting mechanism with LLMs to achieve 21.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing log schema extraction methods require human-defined regular expressions and domain expertise, which limits productivity gains and automation potential.

Method: Uses Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting mechanism with LLMs, featuring context-bounded segmentation, embedding-based sampling, hierarchical Q-Tree-driven queries, and textual-residual evolutionary optimization.

Result: Achieves 21.3% average improvement over state-of-the-art methods on LogHub-2.0 benchmark.

Conclusion: SchemaCoder provides the first fully automated schema extraction framework that works across diverse log formats without human customization, significantly advancing log analysis automation.

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Motivation: Skin NTDs cause severe burdens in tropical communities, but AI diagnostic advancements are hindered by data scarcity, especially for underrepresented populations and rare disease manifestations.

Method: Collected 5,623 images from 1,639 cases in CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Ghana, covering 47 skin diseases. Used AI-expert collaboration with foundation language and segmentation models to generate multimodal annotations under dermatologist guidance.

Result: Created eSkinHealth dataset with semantic lesion masks, visual captions, clinical concepts, patient metadata, and diagnosis labels, focusing on skin NTDs and rare conditions in West African populations.

Conclusion: Provides valuable resource and scalable annotation framework to enable more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global dermatology.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

*Jianxing Liao,Tian Zhang,Xiao Feng,Yusong Zhang,Rui Yang,Haorui Wang,Bosi Wen,Ziying Wang,Runzhi Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMR proposes a reinforcement learning method with dynamically mixed rewards to balance subjective writing quality and objective constraint following in creative writing tasks, achieving improvements in both aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods struggle to balance subjective writing quality (literariness, emotional expression) and objective constraint following (format requirements, word limits) in creative writing applications.

Method: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR) uses a dynamically mixed reward system combining a writing reward model for subjective quality and a constraint verification model for objective constraints, with dynamic weight adjustment based on writing quality within sampled groups.

Result: Achieved improvements in instruction following (IFEval from 83.36% to 86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate in manual expert evaluations on WriteEval benchmark) across models from 8B to 72B parameters.

Conclusion: RLMR is the first method to combine subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm offers a more comprehensive framework for assessing LLMs that bridges the gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility, with practical implementation resources available.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUA-RL is a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates LLM-simulated users into RL training for agentic tool use, enabling models to learn efficient communication and tool invocation in dynamic multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for tool use lack integration of dynamic users during training, while real-world agent-user interactions require iterative refinement of understanding through communication alongside tool invocation.

Method: MUA-RL introduces LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop, allowing autonomous learning of communication and tool use strategies in multi-turn interactions.

Result: MUA-RL-32B achieves strong performance across multiple benchmarks: 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2 Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench Agent, outperforming or matching larger models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in dynamic user integration for RL-based agentic tool use, demonstrating effective learning of communication and problem-solving in multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Result: The system enables acquisition of more comprehensive and intelligent information, potentially redefining information acquisition in daily life with profound societal impact.

Conclusion: AppAgent-Pro represents a significant advancement from reactive to proactive agent systems, fundamentally improving information acquisition capabilities through multi-domain integration and intelligent anticipation of user needs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human

Conclusion: VistaWise provides an effective framework that bridges the domain knowledge gap for LLMs in embodied decision-making with minimal training data requirements, demonstrating practical cost-effectiveness for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various

Motivation: LLMs and Agentic AI systems inherit biases from their training data and external sources, which affects fairness, balance of retrieved information, and reduces user trust in these systems.

Method: A novel multi-agent system with specialized agents that orchestrate bias mitigation workflow by optimizing source selection to ensure retrieved content is both relevant and minimally biased.

Result: Experimental results show an 81.82% reduction in bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy, significantly improving fairness and balance of knowledge dissemination.

Conclusion: The Bias Mitigation Agent effectively addresses bias challenges in LLM-based systems, promoting fair and balanced information retrieval while maintaining high relevance, which enhances user trust in AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved

we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in

*Sunguk Choi,Yonghoon Kwon,Heondeuk Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAC-CoT is a method that restricts reasoning to connector phrases for concise explanations, achieving high accuracy on System-2 tasks while maintaining System-1 performance with shorter reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought prompting slows down performance on fast, intuitive System-1 tasks, so there's a need for more efficient reasoning methods that maintain accuracy.

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) restricts reasoning to a fixed set of connector phrases to create concise, well-structured explanations using Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Result: Achieves ~85% on GSM8K, ~40% on GPQA (System-2 tasks), retains ~90% on S1-Bench (System-1), with reasoning traces averaging ~300 tokens (1/3 of baseline length).

Conclusion: CAC-CoT delivers higher efficiency without accuracy loss, providing shorter reasoning traces while maintaining strong performance on both System-1 and System-2 tasks.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMO introduces a memory-augmented framework with reflection RAG and self-adaptive optimization to overcome stateless prompt optimization limitations, enabling cross-run knowledge reuse and better generalization on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods like TextGrad are stateless, lack historical experience preservation, and suffer from overfitting and poor generalization beyond immediate task contexts.

Method: REMO integrates a memory-augmented Reflection RAG module (structured as a "mistake notebook") and a Self-Adaptive Optimizer with LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level reflective insights to iteratively improve prompting strategies.

Result: On GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark using Qwen3-32B, REMO achieves more stable and robust generalization compared to TextGrad baseline, though with increased computational overhead.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run optimization knowledge, supporting continual improvement over time while addressing overfitting and generalization issues in prompt optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF) and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP) to improve open-set test-time adaptation by addressing filtering accuracy issues and error accumulation in domain-shifted scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world test data often exhibits domain shifts and open-set scenarios that degrade closed-set accuracy. Existing methods relying on source models for filtering perform suboptimally on domain-shifted data, while using adapting models leads to instability and error accumulation.

Method: PAF uses an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the primary filter, preventing error propagation. KIP integrates complementary knowledge from adapting model, EMA model, and source model through output calibration for better open-set discrimination.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination across diverse datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PAF-KIP framework effectively addresses filtering accuracy and error accumulation challenges in open-set test-time adaptation, providing robust performance in real-world domain shift scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

*Yi Liu,Xiangyu Liu,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs fail to abstain from answering unanswerable questions despite having cognitive capabilities to recognize flawed questions, and a two-stage method combining cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention significantly improves abstention rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks but consistently fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with inherently unanswerable questions, which poses a trustworthiness issue for AI systems.

Method: A lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention to align the models' internal cognition with external response behavior.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance of LRMs.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the misalignment between LRMs' cognitive capabilities and response behavior, providing a solution for improving trustworthiness in AI systems when dealing with unanswerable questions.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning in language models by leveraging multiple models' token distributions while addressing vocabulary misalignment issues in multi-model collaboration.

Method: Uses distribution distance-based dynamic selection (DDS) strategy to optimally select tokens from multiple models' next token distributions, and introduces minimal complete semantic units (MCSU) to handle vocabulary misalignment.

Result: Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over single-model approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-model collaboration framework with DDS and MCSU effectively enhances language model reasoning capabilities and addresses vocabulary alignment challenges.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models
yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic
selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model
collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units
(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural
alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent LLM approaches in Minecraft face inefficiency and limited fault tolerance for complex tasks requiring lengthy action sequences, while multi-agent collaboration research remains scarce.

Method: Proposes a holistic causality planning framework with two modules: an overarching task graph for global planning and a causality-based module for dependency management using inherent rules for causal intervention.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks within Minecraft environment.

Conclusion: CausalMACE effectively addresses multi-agent collaboration challenges in complex Minecraft tasks through causality-based dependency management and outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

*Chenghao Wu,Ruiyang Ren,Junjie Zhang,Ruirui Wang,Zhongrui Ma,Qi Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STARec is a slow-thinking augmented recommender agent framework that combines fast response with slow reasoning capabilities, achieving significant performance gains with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems and LLM-based agents suffer from static user modeling, reactive decision-making, shallow correlation bias, limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios.

Method: Models each user as an agent with parallel cognitions (fast response + slow reasoning with chain-of-thought). Uses anchored reinforcement training with structured knowledge distillation from advanced reasoning models and preference-aligned reward shaping.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains compared to state-of-the-art baselines on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks, using only 0.4% of full training data.

Conclusion: STARec successfully endows recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches through slow-thinking augmentation.

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

### [100] [Judicial Requirements for Generative AI in Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18880)
*Eljas Linna,Tuula Linna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs have limitations in legal reasoning despite various AI enhancement techniques. Current best role is as assistant for simple cases and sparring partner for complex legal matters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM limitations in high-stakes legal domains and define core capabilities needed for reliable judicial decision-making tools.

Method: Uses IRAC framework to analyze legal reasoning requirements, maps AI enhancement mechanisms (RAG, multi-agent systems, neuro-symbolic AI) to legal challenges, and assesses their potential.

Result: AI techniques can address specific legal challenges but significant limitations remain, especially in tasks requiring discretion and transparent reasoning.

Conclusion: AI's most effective current role in law is dual: high-volume assistant for simple cases and sophisticated sparring partner for human experts in complex matters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an interactive evaluation framework using requirement dependency graphs and interviewer-interviewee LLM dialogue to dynamically assess programming capabilities, revealing weaknesses that static benchmarks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard static benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating LLMs on complex software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and error correction.

Method: Uses a requirement dependency graph for programming tasks, with an interviewer LLM (aware of ground truth) providing targeted hints to an interviewee LLM to correct errors and fulfill constraints through structured dialogue.

Result: The framework enables fine-grained diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering systematic weaknesses that static benchmarks cannot measure. Expert annotation confirms the relevance and utility of interviewer hints.

Conclusion: Dynamic evaluation through interactive frameworks is crucial for advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents and provides more comprehensive assessment than static benchmarks.

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

TL;DR: FormaRL is a reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization that uses Lean compiler syntax checks and LLM consistency checks as rewards, achieving 4-6x accuracy improvements with minimal unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoformalization advancement is hindered by data scarcity and lack of efficient methods, requiring a solution that works with limited unlabeled data.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with syntax checks from Lean compiler and consistency checks from large language models to calculate rewards, employing GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer.

Result: Increased pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by 4-6x (4.04% to 26.15% on ProofNet and 2.4% to 9.6% on uproof) with only 859 unlabeled data. Also improved out-of-distribution performance on uproof.

Conclusion: FormaRL provides an efficient RL framework for autoformalization that works well with minimal data, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements and strong out-of-distribution performance.

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

TL;DR: CTGraph is a graph-level representation learning approach that profiles student behaviors and performance in ITSs using self-supervised learning to identify struggling students and provide holistic learning journey insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent Tutoring Systems can unintentionally widen performance gaps, making student profiling crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and reducing educational disparities.

Method: CTGraph uses graph-level representation learning in a self-supervised manner to measure student behaviors across content coverage, learning intensity, and concept proficiency, aligned with curriculum structure.

Result: CTGraph provides holistic views of student learning journeys, identifies struggling students, enables comparative analysis of diverse groups, and pinpoints when/where students struggle.

Conclusion: The approach empowers educators with rich insights into student learning and enables more targeted interventions to address performance gaps in educational systems.

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION is a framework that uses counterfactual training with LLMs to improve GNN-based vulnerability detection by reducing spurious correlations, achieving significant accuracy improvements from 51.8% to 97.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs for vulnerability detection suffer from training data imbalances and label noise, learning spurious correlations from superficial code similarities that fail to generalize to real-world data.

Method: Three-step framework: (1) Generate counterfactuals using LLM prompting, (2) Targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels, (3) Graph-based interpretability to identify crucial code statements while ignoring spurious ones.

Result: Significant improvements: overall accuracy from 51.8% to 97.8%, pairwise contrast accuracy from 4.5% to 95.8%, worst-group accuracy from 0.7% to 85.5% on CWE-20 vulnerability. Also released CWE-20-CFA benchmark with 27,556 functions.

Conclusion: VISION enables more robust and generalizable vulnerability detection while advancing transparent AI cybersecurity through interpretability and human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical clustering with k-nearest neighbors to address neural network limitations like hallucination and high computational costs, using Kohonen self-organizing maps for efficient nearest neighbor searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fundamental limitations of neural networks including hallucination effects, high computational complexity, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting that hinder critical applications.

Method: Uses k-nearest neighbors algorithm with hierarchical clustering structures and tree-like data structures based on Kohonen self-organizing maps to accelerate nearest neighbor searches.

Result: Tests on handwritten digit recognition and subtitle translation showed significant speed improvements (hundreds of times faster) with only slight accuracy reduction compared to exhaustive search.

Conclusion: The method provides transparency, interpretability, aligns with human cognition, and shows potential for high-reliability applications requiring explainable results.

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel MoE offloading approach that uses expert importance to guide substitution decisions, reducing memory usage and PCIe overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Mixture of Experts models on edge hardware is constrained by limited device memory, requiring efficient dynamic expert offloading strategies that go beyond traditional scheduling approaches.

Method: Leverages expert importance to guide offloading decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts with functionally similar cached experts in GPU memory. Introduces a scheduling policy that maximizes reuse of GPU-cached experts.

Result: 48% lower decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy. Reduces memory usage and data transfer while eliminating PCIe overhead.

Conclusion: The importance-guided expert substitution approach enables efficient MoE deployment on edge hardware by significantly reducing latency and memory requirements without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models like GPT-4.5 can predict human social appropriateness judgments better than individual humans, achieving up to 100th percentile accuracy, demonstrating that sophisticated social cognition can emerge from statistical learning alone without embodied experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models can acquire sophisticated social norm understanding through statistical learning alone, challenging theories that emphasize the exclusive necessity of embodied social experience for cultural competence.

Method: Two studies evaluating multiple AI systems' ability to predict human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by comparing how closely they predicted average human judgments relative to individual human participants.

Result: GPT-4.5 achieved 100th percentile accuracy (outperforming every human participant), Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed 98.7% of humans, GPT-5 outperformed 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 outperformed 96.0%. All models showed systematic, correlated errors despite high predictive power.

Conclusion: Sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging theories requiring embodied experience. Language serves as a rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission, though systematic errors indicate potential boundaries of pattern-based social understanding.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI progresses toward general intelligence, there's a need to shift from static task optimization to creating open-ended agents that can learn continuously through real-world interaction and self-evolution.

Method: Proposes ELL framework with four core principles: Experience Exploration, Long-term Memory, Skill Learning, and Knowledge Internalization. Also introduces StuLife benchmark dataset simulating a student's college journey across three phases and ten sub-scenarios.

Result: The framework enables agents to continuously grow through interaction, preserve historical knowledge, abstract reusable skills, and internalize experiences. StuLife provides evaluation platform for memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior.

Conclusion: ELL framework and StuLife benchmark represent significant steps toward developing continuously learning agents and advancing AGI, with emphasis on context engineering and evaluation of lifelong learning capabilities.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

*Marcin Moskalewicz,Anna Sterna,Marek Pokropski,Paula Flores*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4) were tested for phenomenological analysis of BPD interviews, showing variable overlap with human analysis (0-58%) but recovering missed themes, with Gemini performing closest to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if large language models can support phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experiences in Borderline Personality Disorder, potentially mitigating human interpretative bias.

Method: Compared three LLMs prompted to mimic human investigators' interpretative style on 24 BPD patient interviews, using blinded expert judges, semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity ratings.

Result: Variable overlap with human analysis (GPT: 0%, Claude: 42%, Gemini: 58%), low Jaccard coefficients (0.21-0.28), but models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini scored highest validity and was judged as human by blinded experts.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for AI-augmented thematic analysis in phenomenological research, with Gemini performing most similarly to human experts, though performance varies significantly across models.

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

*Surajit Das,Gourav Roy,Aleksei Eliseev,Ram Kumar Rajendran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APME is a reinforcement learning framework that estimates question difficulty using only solver performance data (marks and time), achieving high accuracy (R2=0.9213) without needing linguistic features or expert labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human labeling is subjective and existing NLP methods fail in symbolic domains like algebra. There's a need for objective, domain-agnostic methods to determine question difficulty in Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Method: Uses a Multi-Armed Bandit framework with reinforcement learning, leveraging the inverse coefficient of variation as a risk-adjusted metric. Estimates difficulty solely from solver performance data (marks obtained and time taken).

Result: Achieved average R2 of 0.9213 and RMSE of 0.0584 across three datasets. Outperformed regression-based, NLP-driven, and IRT baseline models, especially in symbolic domains.

Conclusion: The framework provides an explainable, scalable, and domain-agnostic approach for adaptive assessment. It aligns with Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development and can be extended to other domains with solver interaction data.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

*Congchi Yin,Tianyi Wu,Yankai Shu,Alex Gu,Yunhan Wang,Jun Shao,Xun Jiang,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new black-box interaction evaluation paradigm for testing LLMs' integrated reasoning abilities through interactive exploration of hidden functions, with o3 performing best but still struggling with complex tasks due to planning limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation tasks fail to assess LLMs' integrated reasoning abilities in interactive, unknown environments, focusing only on isolated reasoning types rather than the holistic reasoning process humans use in real-world discovery.

Method: Introduces black-box interaction paradigm where LLMs interact with hidden functions (black-boxes) through input-output exploration, and builds the Oracle benchmark with 6 task types and 96 black-boxes to test 19 modern LLMs.

Result: o3 ranks first in 5 out of 6 tasks, achieving over 70% accuracy on easy black-boxes but dropping below 40% on hard tasks. Analysis reveals LLMs universally lack high-level planning capability for efficient exploration strategies.

Conclusion: The black-box interaction paradigm effectively reveals LLMs' reasoning limitations, particularly their inability to develop adaptive exploration strategies, highlighting a critical area for improvement in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

TL;DR: CMA is a framework using multiple asynchronous LLM-based modules that communicate through language to create emergent, coherent behavior, demonstrating practical implementation of Minsky's Society of Mind theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address difficulties in agent architectures by enabling intention to emerge from language-mediated interactions among autonomous processes, creating flexible and adaptive behavior.

Method: Uses concurrently executed LLM-based modules with inter-module communication and a single shared global state, operating fully asynchronously while maintaining coherence.

Result: Demonstrated viability through two practical use-case studies, showing emergent properties that suggest complex cognitive phenomena like self-awareness can arise from simpler processes.

Conclusion: The framework supports Minsky's Society of Mind concept and opens new avenues for AI research by showing how organized interaction of simple processes can produce complex cognitive behaviors.

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SST framework improves LLM mathematical reasoning using structured solution templates and difficulty-based curriculum, achieving better accuracy on complex problems through explicit procedural logic teaching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with deep procedural reasoning in mathematics despite post-training improvements. The discovery of a Scaling Law by Difficulty showing U-shaped performance curve with data complexity motivates a structured approach to teach procedural logic.

Method: Structured Solution Template (SST) framework with: 1) Fine-tuning using solution-template chains and weighted loss, 2) Prompt-time template injection as cognitive scaffolds, 3) Integrated curriculum fine-tuning teaching self-plan-execute-correct cycle with varied difficulty data.

Result: Significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency on GSM8K, AIME24, and Dynamic En benchmarks, particularly on harder mathematical problems.

Conclusion: The SST framework effectively enhances LLM procedural reasoning by leveraging structured templates and difficulty-based curriculum, addressing limitations in capturing deep mathematical logic through explicit teaching of solution procedures.

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for EHR analysis but face hallucination risks in clinical settings, requiring better metrics to quantify accuracy-reliability trade-offs.

Method: Introduces Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%) metric and TrustEHRAgent agent with stepwise confidence estimation for clinical QA.

Result: TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, achieving 44.23%p and 25.34%p improvements at HCAcc@70% where baselines fail.

Conclusion: Traditional accuracy metrics are insufficient for healthcare AI evaluation; confidence-aware agents can provide trustworthy clinical information or transparent uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

TL;DR: HDS-QA is a synthetic dataset that trains large reasoning models to distinguish parallelizable from sequential queries, enabling hybrid querying that reduces latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential querying methods in large reasoning models increase inference latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing accuracy.

Method: Created HDS-QA synthetic dataset from Natural Questions with hybrid-hop questions combining parallelizable and sequential subqueries. Fine-tuned an LRM (HybridDeepSearcher) using this dataset to learn hybrid query strategies.

Result: HybridDeepSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving +15.9 and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and BrowseComp subsets. It achieves comparable accuracy with fewer search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and scales effectively with more turns.

Conclusion: Explicit training of LRMs to leverage hybrid parallel and sequential querying demonstrates efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First theoretical framework for Algorithmic Collective Action with multiple collectives acting on the same classification system, analyzing how different collectives can coordinate to bias classifiers through feature manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As algorithmic systems increasingly impact daily decisions, user-side steering through coordinated data changes offers an alternative to regulation and firm-side design. Real-world actions are often fragmented across multiple collectives with varying sizes and goals, but existing research focuses only on single collective settings.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework for multiple collectives acting on the same classification system, studying how collectives can plant signals by biasing classifiers to learn associations between altered features and target classes. Analyzed the interplay of collective sizes and goal alignment.

Result: Provided quantitative results showing the role and interaction between collectives' sizes and their goal alignment in successful algorithmic collective action. The framework complements previous empirical findings.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first comprehensive theoretical foundation for studying Algorithmic Collective Action with multiple collectives, enabling a more holistic understanding of how fragmented user groups can coordinate to influence algorithmic systems through strategic data manipulation.

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

*Chiu-Chou Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This dissertation introduces playstyle as a new dimension for analyzing AI decision-making, proposing a framework to measure, generate, and apply stylistic behaviors in intelligent agents beyond pure rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI development focuses too much on rational decision-making while ignoring the influence of beliefs, values, and preferences that shape human-like decision styles, which are essential for more authentic and diverse intelligent behavior.

Method: Develops a two-tier framework for style formation (external interaction and internal cognitive loops), formalizes style characteristics with measurable indicators, and explores reinforcement learning and imitation learning techniques for style generation and expression.

Result: Proposes general playstyle metrics based on discretized state spaces, methods for quantifying strategic diversity and competitive balance, and novel approaches for human-like style learning and modeling with applications in game design and interactive entertainment.

Conclusion: Playstyle represents a crucial but overlooked dimension of intelligence that should be integrated into AI development, with potential to serve as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems.

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluations focus on task completion and fluency but lack insights into behavioral and risk management requirements essential for safety-critical clinical systems.

Method: MATRIX integrates three components: 1) safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical scenarios and failure modes, 2) BehvJudge (LLM-based evaluator for safety failures), and 3) PatBot (simulated patient agent). Validated through expert clinician annotations and human factors expertise.

Result: BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved expert-level hazard detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians. PatBot reliably simulates realistic patient behavior. Framework benchmarked 5 LLM agents across 2,100 dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios and 10 clinical domains.

Conclusion: MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing for clinical dialogue systems.

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To augment scientific creativity by developing a systematic framework for research ideation that combines human expertise with AI capabilities, inspired by medieval combinatorial knowledge generation methods.

Method: Define three compositional axes (Theme, Domain, Method) representing research motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches. Mine elements from experts/conference papers, then prompt LLMs with curated combinations to generate diverse research ideas.

Result: The approach produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature, demonstrating effectiveness in augmenting scientific creativity through systematic combinatorial exploration.

Conclusion: This modern thinking machine provides a lightweight, interpretable tool for collaborative ideation between humans and AI, offering a practical path for enhancing research creativity through structured combinatorial approaches.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

*Wei Xiong,Wenting Zhao,Weizhe Yuan,Olga Golovneva,Tong Zhang,Jason Weston,Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepWiser is a generative judge model that meta-reasons about intermediate reasoning steps, providing better accuracy than classification-based approaches and improving both training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current process reward models lack explanations and have limited generalization due to supervised fine-tuning on static datasets, creating a need for more effective stepwise supervision.

Method: Reframe stepwise reward modeling as a reasoning task using a generative judge that outputs thinking tokens before verdicts, trained with reinforcement learning on relative rollout outcomes.

Result: StepWiser achieves better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps, improves policy model training, and enhances inference-time search capabilities.

Conclusion: Generative meta-reasoning approaches outperform classification-based methods for stepwise reward modeling, offering improved accuracy and generalization for multi-step reasoning supervision.

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey paper analyzes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a unifying solution for fragmented adaptive transport systems, showing existing efforts naturally converge toward MCP-like architectures and proposing a taxonomy and research roadmap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems with diverse protocols and context sources remaining isolated.

Method: Systematic investigation and analysis of established literature, proposing a five-category taxonomy covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models, integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures.

Result: Findings reveal that traditional transport protocols have reached limits of isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration paradigms suited to MCP.

Conclusion: MCP is positioned as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures, with a research roadmap provided for future development.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business
applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic
planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent

environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate

### [125] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for semantic AGI using complex-valued meaning spaces and semantic attractors, moving beyond statistical language models to model meaning through recursive tensorial transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more sophisticated AGI that can handle semantic complexity like irony, homonymy, and ambiguity, rather than just statistical next-token prediction used in current transformer models.

Method: Uses cyclic operations with imaginary unit i to create rotational semantic structures, with a semantic attractor (Microvitum) acting as an intentional agent that guides meaning toward stability through gradient flows, tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics.

Result: The framework offers a mathematically suggestive and philosophically significant model of semantic transformation that enables recursive convergence toward semantic coherence rather than mere simulation.

Conclusion: True meaning emerges from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, requiring a fundamentally new cognitive architecture designed to shape language rather than just predict it.

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAIROS benchmark evaluates LLM trust formation, misinformation resistance, and peer integration in multi-agent systems, showing GRPO with multi-agent context performs best but reduces social influence robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs form trust from previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during interactions in multi-agent systems, which are key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics.

Method: Developed KAIROS benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, controlling conditions like expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers. Evaluated prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning (GRPO) across multiple models.

Result: GRPO with multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but decreases robustness to social influence compared to Base models.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLM behavior in multi-agent systems and demonstrates effective mitigation strategies, though trade-offs exist between performance and social influence robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

*Masudul Hasan Masud Bhuiyan,Matteo Varvello,Yasir Zaki,Cristian-Alexandru Staicu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangCrUX dataset reveals widespread multilingual web accessibility issues where accessibility hints fail to reflect language diversity, limiting screen reader effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual web content creates barriers for visually impaired users as assistive technologies lack robust support for non-Latin scripts, but large-scale studies have been limited by dataset availability.

Method: Introduced LangCrUX dataset of 120,000 websites across 12 non-Latin script languages, conducted systematic analysis of multilingual accessibility, and developed Kizuki language-aware automated testing extension.

Result: Found widespread neglect of accessibility hints that fail to reflect language diversity of visible content, reducing screen reader effectiveness and limiting web accessibility.

Conclusion: Multilingual web accessibility requires language-aware approaches, and the proposed Kizuki extension addresses the limitations of language-inconsistent accessibility hints to improve assistive technology support.

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

*Yuchun Fan,Yilin Wang,Yongyu Mu,Lei Huang,Bei Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAST is an efficient training method that enhances multilingual capabilities in large vision-language models by identifying and fine-tuning language-specific layers using only 14% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models show imbalanced multilingual capabilities despite strong visual understanding, with a correlation found between multilingual ability and language-specific neuron activations in shallow layers.

Method: PLAST identifies layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific neuron activations, then precisely fine-tunes these layers using question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment.

Result: Empirical results on MM-Bench and MMMB show PLAST effectively improves multilingual capabilities while being highly efficient. The method also generalizes to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PLAST provides an efficient approach to enhance multilingual alignment in LVLMs by targeting specific layers, facilitating better language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

*Kellen Tan Cheng,Anna Lisa Gentile,Chad DeLuca,Guang-Jie Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Backprompting method generates production-like labeled data for health advice guardrails, improving detector performance with 400x fewer parameters than GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data for LLM output filtering prior to deployment, especially for nuanced guardrails like health advice identification.

Method: Propose backprompting to generate production-like labeled data, combined with sparse human-in-the-loop clustering to label generated data, creating synthetic examples to augment existing datasets.

Result: Detector outperforms GPT-4o by up to 3.73% despite having 400x fewer parameters, demonstrating effectiveness in health advice identification.

Conclusion: Backprompting provides an effective solution for generating production-like training data, enabling robust guardrail detectors without requiring extensive real labeled data prior to deployment.

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Integral Transformer addresses attention noise in softmax self-attention by integrating signals from logit distribution, preserving useful special tokens while denoising attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax self-attention assigns disproportionate weight to semantically uninformative tokens like special tokens and punctuation, creating attention noise. Existing methods with negative attention scores risk discarding useful information.

Method: Proposes Integral Transformer with novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution, preserving contributions of critical special tokens.

Result: Outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on established knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Analysis shows vanilla self-attention in lower layers enhances performance, while Integral Transformer balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

Conclusion: The Integral Transformer effectively mitigates attention noise while preserving important information from special tokens, achieving superior performance on language benchmarks and addressing attention distribution issues in upper Transformer layers.

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [131] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)
*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) is a new method that uses learnable token embeddings to select the most semantically consistent response, outperforming existing consistency methods on both short-form and long-form reasoning benchmarks with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic decoding in LLMs produces inconsistent outputs, especially on complex or long-form questions. Current methods like Self-Consistency work for short-form QA but fail on long-form, while extensions like USC and WUCS lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.

Method: LSC selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. It uses a lightweight forward generation of summary tokens that increases inference time by less than 1% and requires no architecture changes.

Result: Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all benchmarks while maintaining negligible computational overhead. It also provides well-calibrated confidence estimates with low Expected Calibration Error.

Conclusion: LSC is a practical consistency-selection method that works reliably across both short-form and long-form answer formats, offering superior performance with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

*Michal Å tefÃ¡nik,Timothee Mickus,Marek KadlÄÃ­k,Michal Spiegel,Josef KuchaÅ*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OOD evaluations may not reliably capture real-world failure modes in QA models, as different datasets provide varying quality estimates of robustness to spurious shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations can adequately reflect real-world deployment failures in question-answering models, particularly those related to reliance on spurious features.

Method: Confronted OOD evaluation results with documented failure modes in QA models, specifically analyzing reliance on spurious features and prediction shortcuts across different datasets.

Result: Found that different OOD datasets provide vastly different quality estimates of model robustness to shortcuts, with some underperforming even simple in-distribution evaluations. Spurious shortcuts are often shared across ID and OOD datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations of commonly-used OOD-based generalization evaluations and provides methodology and recommendations for more robust evaluation of generalization within and beyond QA.

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

### [133] [How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444)
*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of how different LLM training methods affect semantic understanding and explainability in re-ranking tasks, particularly in domains with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show improved human value alignment but lack transparency, and face challenges in re-ranking tasks with limited user engagement and ranking data. Need to understand which training methods provide better explainability and reliable semantic understanding.

Method: Utilized a small ranking dataset from environmental and Earth science domains to analyze LLM re-ranking performance. Examined different training methods and their impact on semantic understanding and explainability through textual reasoning analysis.

Result: Found that some training methods exhibit better explainability than others, suggesting not all methods learn accurate semantic understanding - some gain abstract knowledge that optimizes evaluation metrics without true comprehension.

Conclusion: Training methods significantly impact LLM explainability and semantic understanding in re-ranking tasks. The study raises questions about LLM reliability and highlights the importance of explainable reasoning for transparent decision-making in content re-ranking.

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

### [134] [Integrating gender inclusivity into large language models via instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18466)
*Alina WrÃ³blewska,Bartosz Å»uk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study addresses masculine bias in Polish language models by tuning LLMs with gender-inclusive guidelines using the IPIS dataset to create more balanced gender representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polish language predominantly uses masculine forms for all genders due to historical conventions, causing LLMs to inherit and reinforce this gender bias in their outputs.

Method: Tuning multilingual and Polish-specific LLMs using the IPIS dataset (human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading) with a system prompt containing explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish.

Result: The approach successfully integrates gender inclusivity as an inherent feature in the tested models (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B, Mistral-Nemo, Bielik, and PLLuM).

Conclusion: This provides a systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation by making gender inclusivity a built-in capability of language models.

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

*Jiawei Li,Akshayaa Magesh,Venugopal V. Veeravalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multiple-testing-inspired method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs by formulating it as a hypothesis testing problem similar to out-of-distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but prone to generating confident but incorrect/nonsensical responses (hallucinations), requiring robust detection methods.

Method: Formulates hallucination detection as a hypothesis testing problem, drawing parallels to out-of-distribution detection, and proposes a multiple-testing-inspired approach.

Result: Extensive experimental results show the proposed method is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for hallucination detection.

Conclusion: The multiple-testing-inspired framework provides an effective solution for detecting hallucinations in LLMs, addressing a critical limitation of current language models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes two new automated MT metrics (COMET-polycand and COMET-polyic) that incorporate multiple translations or contextual examples to improve correlation with human judgments, achieving significant performance gains over single-translation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated MT metrics only consider source sentence and single translation, unlike humans who assess translations in context of multiple alternatives. This discrepancy may negatively impact metric performance.

Method: COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of same source sentence for comparative assessment. COMET-polyic uses retrieved translations of similar source texts with human quality scores for in-context learning guidance.

Result: Adding single additional translation improves segment-level performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b correlation), with further gains from more translations. Retrieved examples yield similar improvements (0.079 to 0.116 correlation).

Conclusion: Incorporating multiple translations or contextual examples significantly improves automated MT metric performance, better replicating human evaluation patterns. Models are publicly released.

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

*Girish A. Koushik,Fatemeh Nazarieh,Katherine Birch,Shenbin Qian,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-evaluating framework for visual metaphor generation that uses metaphor decomposition and meaning alignment metrics, with both training-free and training-based approaches that outperform strong baselines on technical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual metaphor generation requires understanding language to bind source and target concepts while maintaining visual coherence, but existing methods struggle with metaphor alignment.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Training-free pipeline that decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning mapping for image synthesis, and 2) Training-based pipeline that improves alignment using self-evaluation reward schema without large-scale retraining.

Result: Training-free approach surpassed GPT-4o and Imagen on decomposition, CLIP, and meaning alignment scores. User study showed participants preferred GPT-4o overall, but training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged Imagen on abstract metaphors.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and lightweight reinforcement learning effectively perform metaphor alignment with modest compute, with remaining gaps to human preference driven by aesthetics and sampling rather than metaphor understanding.

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

### [138] [What do language models model? Transformers, automata, and the format of thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18598)
*Colin Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs model corpus statistics rather than human cognition due to architectural constraints - transformers use linear processing while human language requires supralinear computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models actually model human cognitive capacities or simply reflect statistical patterns in their training corpora.

Method: Analyzes computational architecture invariants of transformers, comparing their linear processing formats against human supralinear linguistic computation, and examines Liu et al.'s shortcut automata concept.

Result: Transformers cannot model human linguistic capabilities due to architectural limitations in computational format, but they effectively learn to use language as a 'discourse machine' through statistical patterns.

Conclusion: LLMs are models of corpus statistics rather than human cognition, using different means to achieve similar language generation capabilities through statistical learning of discourse patterns.

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

*Rumeng Li,Xun Wang,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NOOV is a neural machine translation system that translates EHR narratives from English to Spanish with minimal parallel training data, using bilingual lexicons and biomedical phrase tables to handle unknown words and improve translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating electronic health records between English and Spanish is clinically important but challenging due to lack of parallel-aligned corpora and abundant unknown medical terms.

Method: Proposes NOOV system that integrates automatically learned bilingual lexicons from parallel corpora and phrase look-up tables from large biomedical knowledge resources to handle unknown words and word-repeat challenges.

Result: Evaluation shows NOOV generates better EHR translations with improvements in both accuracy and fluency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NOOV effectively addresses the challenges of EHR translation by leveraging external knowledge resources and requires minimal in-domain parallel data for training, making it practical for clinical applications.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

*Chenxi Zhou,Pengfei Cao,Jiang Li,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how post-training quantization affects LLM knowledge capabilities, finding memorization is more sensitive than utilization to quantization parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how PTQ precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities and establish comprehensive scaling laws that account for PTQ-specific parameters and task sensitivities.

Method: Conducted extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified scaling laws, disentangled LLM knowledge into memorization vs utilization capabilities, and developed a unified quantitative framework incorporating model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size.

Result: Knowledge memorization exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings provide fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and guidance for developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve targeted cognitive functions in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TBYS framework inserts proactive insights between reasoning steps to bridge gaps in LLM training data, improving complex reasoning performance without human labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks because human training data often lacks articulated inner thoughts and intentions that bridge reasoning steps.

Method: Proposes Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS) framework that automatically generates insights between reasoning steps, with a pipeline for collecting and filtering in-context examples.

Result: Experiments on challenging mathematical datasets show TBYS effectively improves reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Proactively generating insights between reasoning steps addresses LLM reasoning deficiencies and reduces human labeling efforts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

*Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si,Zheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDe framework dynamically integrates knowledge-grounded and non-grounded outputs using distribution divergence and confidence metrics to break the faithfulness-expressiveness trade-off in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to maintain both faithfulness (grounding in external knowledge) and expressiveness (natural language quality) simultaneously, resulting in either ungrounded outputs or unnatural verbose responses.

Method: Collaborative Decoding (CoDe) integrates output probabilities from knowledge-grounded and non-grounded generation, guided by distribution divergence and model confidence. Includes knowledge-aware reranking to balance external knowledge usage with parametric knowledge.

Result: Superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: CoDe provides a plug-and-play framework that successfully breaks the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness in knowledge-grounded LLM responses through dynamic probability integration and selective activation mechanisms.

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

### [143] [Emotion Omni: Enabling Empathetic Speech Response Generation through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18655)
*Haoyu Wang,Guangyan Zhang,Jiale Chen,Jingyu Li,Yuehai Wang,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Emotion Omni, a novel speech LLM architecture that understands emotional cues in user speech and generates empathetic responses without requiring massive datasets or large-scale training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech LLMs lack emotional understanding of user queries, failing to capture rich emotional and paralinguistic cues that change sentence meanings. Current empathetic models require massive datasets and computational resources.

Method: Developed Emotion Omni model architecture for emotional understanding and empathetic speech generation. Created a data generation pipeline using open-source TTS framework to build a 200k emotional dialogue dataset.

Result: Constructed an empathetic speech assistant capable of understanding emotional content in user speech and generating appropriate empathetic responses with limited data requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables development of emotionally intelligent speech assistants without the need for massive datasets or extensive computational resources, addressing a key challenge in empathetic human-machine interaction.

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework for Multimodal Chain-of-Thought prompting that uses difficulty-balanced sampling based on model-perceived difficulty and intrinsic sample complexity to improve multimodal reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random or manually selected examples in MCoT prompting fail to account for model-specific knowledge distributions and task complexity, leading to suboptimal and unstable model performance.

Method: Reframes prompt selection as curriculum design, integrating two signals: model-perceived difficulty (quantified through prediction disagreement) and intrinsic sample complexity. Uses difficulty-balanced sampling strategy to select diverse examples.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks with multiple MLLMs show substantial and consistent improvements, greatly reducing performance discrepancies from random sampling.

Conclusion: Provides a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning through difficulty-balanced prompt curriculum design.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-VLMs show fragility in medical VQA with inconsistent answers to rephrased questions. RoMed dataset reveals 40% performance drop. CCL method improves consistency by 50% through knowledge-anchored consistency and bias-aware contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Medical Vision-Language Models exhibit concerning fragility in Medical Visual Question Answering, with answers fluctuating significantly when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions, which is critical for reliable diagnosis in high-stakes medical applications.

Method: Constructed RoMed dataset with 144k questions across word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level variations. Proposed Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL) with two components: knowledge-anchored consistency learning to align with medical knowledge, and bias-aware contrastive learning to mitigate data-specific priors.

Result: Evaluation on RoMed showed alarming performance drops (40% decline in Recall) for SOTA models like LLaVA-Med. CCL achieved SOTA performance on three popular VQA benchmarks and improved answer consistency by 50% on RoMed test set.

Conclusion: CCL demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness for Medical Vision-Language Models, addressing critical fragility issues in medical question answering consistency through improved medical concept alignment and bias mitigation.

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: Attention2Probability is a lightweight attention-driven method that converts cross-attention weights into presence probabilities to improve domain-specific terminology recognition in speech-to-text systems, achieving high recall rates with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech large language models struggle with accurately generating domain-specific terms and neologisms, creating a need for robust terminology handling in speech-to-text systems.

Method: Proposes Attention2Probability which converts cross-attention weights between speech and terminology into presence probabilities, uses curriculum learning for enhanced retrieval accuracy, and creates a new speech dataset with terminology.

Result: Significantly outperforms VectorDB method with maximum recall rates of 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English, with only 8.71ms latency per query. Improves terminology accuracy by 6-17% in SLM tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses terminology challenges in speech recognition/translation, though current SLM utilization of terminology still has limitations that need further improvement.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

TL;DR: AOF prompting framework improves multilingual riddle generation by filtering redundant content and enforcing lexical novelty, achieving better diversity than standard prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard prompting strategies for multilingual riddle generation tend to reuse memorized content or perform shallow paraphrasing, lacking cultural fluency and creative abstraction.

Method: Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) - a prompting framework that uses cosine-based similarity rejection to filter redundant generations while enforcing lexical novelty and cross-lingual fidelity.

Result: AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieved 0.177 Self-BLEU and 0.915 Distinct-2 in Japanese, showing improved lexical diversity and reduced redundancy across three LLMs and four language pairs.

Conclusion: Semantic rejection through AOF can guide culturally grounded, creative generation without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: Large language models in customer service create risks of user impersonation through machine-generated text, and current detection methods lack reliability and interpretability for non-expert operators who need trustworthy explanations.

Method: Proposed EMMM framework that follows an explanation-then-detection approach, balancing latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability in conversational settings.

Result: EMMM provides explanations accessible to non-expert users with 70% human evaluator preference, achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, and maintains low latency (outputs within 1 second).

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the need for trustworthy and interpretable machine-generated text detection in customer service scenarios with non-expert users, offering a practical solution with open-sourced code and dataset.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ad headline generation approaches focus on quality or CTR but overlook diversity, resulting in homogeneous outputs that fail to engage diverse audience segments.

Method: Proposes a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline, followed by multi-stage multi-objective optimization with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate diverse, high-quality headlines in a single forward pass.

Result: Experiments on real-world industrial datasets show DIVER effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale platform serving hundreds of millions of users, it improves advertiser value by 4.0% and CTR by 1.4%.

Conclusion: DIVER successfully addresses the diversity-quality tradeoff in ad headline generation and demonstrates significant real-world performance improvements when deployed at scale.

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the scarcity of multimodal MECTEC datasets and limitations of existing methods that fail to explicitly model emotional/causal contexts and properly fuse semantic information at different levels.

Method: Proposes M3HG model that uses multimodal heterogeneous graph to explicitly capture emotional and causal contexts, fusing contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate M3HG's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Introduces MECAD dataset with 989 conversations from 56 TV series covering diverse dialogue contexts.

Conclusion: M3HG effectively addresses current limitations in MECTEC by explicitly modeling contexts and fusing multimodal information, with the new MECAD dataset enabling better model development in this field.

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChronoRAG is a novel RAG framework that improves narrative QA by structuring passages coherently and preserving temporal order, showing significant improvements on NarrativeQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with narrative texts because they fail to capture sequential relationships and broader context needed for comprehension, as narrative QA requires reconstructing coherent timelines of events.

Method: Proposes ChronoRAG framework that refines dispersed document information into structured passages and explicitly captures/maintains temporal order among retrieved passages to preserve narrative flow.

Result: Substantial improvements on NarrativeQA dataset, particularly in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships.

Conclusion: Reasoning over temporal order is crucial for resolving narrative QA, and ChronoRAG effectively addresses the limitations of existing RAG approaches for narrative texts.

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning lack computational control, and open-source models have failed to achieve the controllable reasoning capabilities of proprietary systems like GPT-4o.

Method: End-to-end training paradigm with budget-mode supervised fine-tuning and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping.

Result: Achieves 50% token reduction with <10% performance degradation (Medium mode) and 75% token reduction with <15% degradation (Low mode) while maintaining strong generalization on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: ThinkDial successfully implements controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes, providing practical computational efficiency for LLM deployment while maintaining performance thresholds.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

*Yilin Li,Xunjian Yin,Yilin Chen,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Rule-Based RL framework for grammatical error correction that outperforms traditional supervised fine-tuning methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved recall on Chinese datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional encoder-decoder models have limitations in GEC, and current LLM approaches rely on supervised fine-tuning which restricts the model's reasoning capabilities. There's a need to better leverage LLMs' powerful abilities in grammatical error correction.

Method: A novel Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that steers large language models for grammatical error correction, moving beyond direct supervised fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chinese datasets with a notable increase in recall, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The Rule-Based RL framework offers a more controllable and reliable paradigm for grammatical error correction, highlighting the advantages of using reinforcement learning to steer LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Theme Detection as a key task in conversational analytics, presenting it as a DSTC 12 competition track focused on joint clustering and theme labeling with controllable granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate topic identification in conversations to reduce manual analysis effort, especially in customer support and sales domains, moving beyond traditional intent detection to more flexible user-facing summaries.

Method: Frames theme detection as a joint clustering and labeling problem with controllability via user preference data, using a public competition track with provided datasets and evaluation metrics.

Result: The paper establishes a benchmark for controllable conversational theme detection, provides an overview of participant submissions, and makes track materials publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Theme detection represents a significant advancement in conversational analytics, offering flexible user-facing summaries with controllable granularity, with the competition track serving as a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern MT systems struggle with LaTeX-formatted documents that interleave natural language with domain-specific syntax (equations, tables, figures, cross-references), requiring accurate preservation for semantic integrity and compilability.

Method: A collaborative multi-agent system with six specialized agents: Parser (decomposes LaTeX via placeholder substitution), Translator, Validator, Summarizer, Terminology Extractor (ensure context-aware, self-correcting translations), and Generator (reconstructs translated content).

Result: Experimental results show LaTeXTrans outperforms mainstream MT systems in both translation accuracy and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans provides an effective and practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents by ensuring format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) for semantic relations and news propagation dynamics. Uses LLM-based graph contrastive loss with negative anchor points for zero-shot feature separability, and multi-view graph masked autoencoder for learning propagation features from social context.

Result: Extensive experiments show the self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even with limited labeled datasets, while improving generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively differentiates fake and real news by combining semantic and propagation-based features in a self-supervised manner, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges

propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfTuner is a fine-tuning method that improves LLM confidence calibration using a tokenized Brier score loss function, without requiring ground-truth confidence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect answers with high confidence (overconfidence), which is problematic in high-stakes domains like science, law, and healthcare where accurate uncertainty expression is crucial.

Method: ConfTuner uses a novel tokenized Brier score loss function that acts as a proper scoring rule, fine-tuning LLMs to better calibrate their verbalized confidence without needing ground-truth confidence estimates.

Result: The method improves calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models like GPT-4o, enabling downstream gains in self-correction and model cascade.

Conclusion: ConfTuner advances trustworthy LLM systems by providing a simple, efficient fine-tuning approach that enhances confidence calibration without requiring proxy confidence estimates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

*Laurie Gale,Sebastian Mateos Nicolajsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA) method to help computing education researchers analyze large volumes of qualitative data more efficiently and rigorously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing education researchers often lack resources to conduct generalizable, rigorous research. Current methods are burdensome for analyzing large qualitative datasets, limiting discipline advancement.

Method: LACA (LLM-assisted content analysis) - combines traditional content analysis with large language models to enable scalable analysis of textual data while maintaining rigor and reproducibility.

Result: Demonstrated application of LACA on computing education dataset shows potential for enabling larger-scale research that would otherwise be infeasible for individual researchers.

Conclusion: LACA and similar methods can advance computing education research by enabling more generalizable findings from diverse research contexts, improving both practice and research quality in the discipline.

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

TL;DR: Automated analysis of parliamentary speeches in six European countries reveals consistent affective polarization patterns, showing increased negativity towards opposing political groups with reciprocity as a key mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the presence and patterns of affective polarization in European parliaments using automated natural language processing techniques on parliamentary speeches.

Method: Used natural language processing on comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from six European countries to estimate sentiment and compare negativity levels in references to opposing vs own group members.

Result: Found consistent affective polarization across all six parliaments, with activity correlating with negativity but no difference between less/more active MPs, and identified reciprocity as a contributing mechanism.

Conclusion: Affective polarization is a consistent feature in European parliamentary discourse, driven by reciprocal negativity between opposing political groups, with activity levels not affecting polarization patterns.

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets that improves RAG evaluation through enhanced semantic diversity and privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluation focuses mainly on performance metrics but neglects dataset quality, particularly semantic diversity and privacy protection of sensitive information, which are crucial for real-world reliability.

Method: Three-agent framework: (1) Diversity agent uses clustering for topical coverage, (2) Privacy Agent detects/masks sensitive information across domains, (3) QA curation agent synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs as ground truth.

Result: Evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and ethically aligned pathway for safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying foundation for future enhancements aligned with AI regulations.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

TL;DR: HiPlan is a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive global-local guidance to enhance LLM-based agents' decision-making in complex tasks by decomposing them into milestones and step-wise hints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with complex, long-horizon planning due to lack of macroscopic guidance and continuous oversight, leading to disorientation and failures in complex tasks.

Method: Hierarchical planning framework that decomposes tasks into milestone action guides and step-wise hints. Offline phase constructs milestone library from expert demonstrations, execution phase dynamically adapts trajectory segments to generate step-wise hints aligned with milestone objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments across two challenging benchmarks show HiPlan substantially outperforms strong baselines, with ablation studies validating complementary benefits of hierarchical components.

Conclusion: HiPlan effectively addresses LLM agents' planning limitations through hierarchical guidance, demonstrating significant performance improvements in complex decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

TL;DR: First study of physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues using SOAP framework taxonomy, with large-scale annotation and benchmarking of state-of-the-art models for medical intent classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how physicians guide medical conversations through targeted questioning and identify intent patterns that can improve differential diagnosis systems and medical dialogue summarization.

Method: Developed fine-grained physician intent taxonomy based on SOAP framework, conducted large-scale annotation of 5000+ doctor-patient turns with medical experts, benchmarked generative and encoder models for intent classification.

Result: Models achieved high accuracy in understanding general medical dialogue structure but struggled with SOAP category transitions. Identified common medical dialogue trajectories and showed significant performance boost in medical dialogue summarization through intent filtering.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable insights into physician intent patterns, establishes benchmark datasets and models for medical intent classification, and demonstrates practical applications for improving differential diagnosis systems and medical dialogue summarization.

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

### [168] [It's All About In-Context Learning! Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19089)
*Yue Li,Zhixue Zhao,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with extremely low-resource languages, especially those with rare scripts. In-context learning with language alignment outperforms parameter-efficient fine-tuning for these languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extremely low-resource languages, particularly those written in rare scripts, remain largely unsupported by large language models due to lack of training data and other compounding factors.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can acquire low-resource languages via in-context learning (with/without auxiliary alignment signals) compared to parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Evaluated 20 under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.

Result: PEFT has limitations when both language and script are extremely under-represented. Zero-shot ICL with language alignment is highly effective for extremely low-resource languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT works better for relatively better represented languages.

Conclusion: For extremely low-resource languages, practitioners should avoid fine-tuning multilingual models on languages of unseen scripts and instead use zero-shot in-context learning with language alignment.

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG framework for art provenance research enables natural-language multilingual searches in fragmented archival data, improving retrieval and summarization of auction records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provenance research is essential for art authentication and historical context but is hindered by fragmented multilingual data and metadata-dependent search systems.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework with semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, tested on 10,000 records from Getty Provenance Index - German Sales.

Result: The approach successfully enables natural-language and multilingual searches, reducing metadata dependency and providing scalable navigation of art market archives.

Conclusion: RAG offers a practical, scalable tool for art historians and cultural heritage professionals to conduct historically sensitive provenance research more efficiently.

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

*Thomas Compton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A transparent hybrid framework for quantitative discourse analysis combining lexical and semantic methods using custom Python tools to ensure reproducibility and methodological triangulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of transparency and methodological alignment in black box QDA software like MAXQDA and NVivo by creating a reproducible, researcher-controlled framework.

Method: Custom Python pipelines using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers for preprocessing and embeddings, combined with iterative BERTopic modeling (UMAP, HDBSCAN, c-TF-IDF) optimized through parameter tuning.

Result: Demonstrated through historical political discourse case study, showing how the hybrid approach enables fine-grained control, topic coherence, and mitigates limitations of isolated methods.

Conclusion: Advocates for code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological triangulation in computational discourse studies, with workflow and materials available on GitHub.

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary
materials are available via GitHub.

### [171] [Do LVLMs Know What They Know? A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19111)
*Zhikai Ding,Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs have reasonable knowledge boundary perception but need improvement; probabilistic and consistency-based confidence are reliable while verbalized confidence causes overconfidence; calibration methods can enhance perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well large vision-language models perceive their knowledge boundaries and understand what they know vs. don't know, as reliable models should recognize their limitations to avoid hallucination.

Method: Evaluated three confidence signals (probabilistic, consistency-based, verbalized) across three LVLMs on VQA datasets. Adapted LLM confidence calibration methods and proposed three new methods to enhance perception.

Result: LVLMs show reasonable perception but substantial room for improvement. Probabilistic and consistency-based confidence are reliable indicators, while verbalized confidence leads to overconfidence. Joint visual-text processing reduces performance but improves perception compared to LLMs.

Conclusion: LVLMs need better knowledge boundary perception. Confidence calibration methods can help improve their self-awareness, with probabilistic and consistency signals being more reliable than verbalized confidence for assessing model certainty.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

*Alan Li,Yixin Liu,Arpan Sarkar,Doug Downey,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciReas and SciReas-Pro benchmarks for scientific reasoning evaluation, proposes KRUX framework to analyze knowledge vs reasoning roles, and finds that knowledge retrieval is a key bottleneck while external knowledge and enhanced reasoning improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no widely adopted holistic benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning in LLMs, and few approaches systematically disentangle the roles of knowledge and reasoning in scientific tasks.

Method: Introduces SciReas benchmark suite and SciReas-Pro subset, proposes KRUX probing framework to study reasoning vs knowledge roles, and conducts comprehensive analysis combining both approaches.

Result: Key findings: (1) Knowledge retrieval from model parameters is a critical bottleneck; (2) External knowledge benefits reasoning models; (3) Enhanced verbalized reasoning improves knowledge surfacing. Also releases SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive benchmarks and analysis framework for scientific reasoning, revealing critical insights about knowledge-reasoning interplay and establishing strong baselines for future research.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VibeVoice is a novel speech synthesis model that uses next-token diffusion to generate long-form multi-speaker conversations with up to 90 minutes of speech in a 64K context window, achieving superior performance through an 80x more efficient continuous speech tokenizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient synthesis of long-form conversational speech with multiple speakers while maintaining audio fidelity and capturing authentic conversational dynamics.

Method: Uses next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation of latent vectors, combined with a novel continuous speech tokenizer that achieves 80x better compression than Encodec while preserving audio quality.

Result: Can synthesize up to 90 minutes of speech with 4 speakers in a 64K context window, outperforming both open-source and proprietary dialogue models while capturing authentic conversational 'vibe'.

Conclusion: VibeVoice demonstrates that next-token diffusion with efficient tokenization enables high-quality long-form multi-speaker speech synthesis, significantly advancing the state of conversational AI systems.

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

### [174] [Evaluating the Evaluators: Are readability metrics good measures of readability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19221)
*Isabel Cachola,Daniel Khashabi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Traditional readability metrics like Flesch-Kincaid perform poorly for Plain Language Summarization evaluation, while Language Models show better correlation with human judgments and capture deeper readability aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PLS evaluation relies on traditional readability metrics that haven't been validated against human judgments, creating a need to identify more effective evaluation methods.

Method: Conducted comprehensive survey of PLS literature, evaluated 8 traditional readability metrics against human judgments, and tested Language Models as alternative readability evaluators.

Result: Most traditional metrics (including FKGL) correlate poorly with human judgments, while LMs achieve up to 0.56 Pearson correlation and better capture complex readability factors like background knowledge requirements.

Conclusion: Language Models outperform traditional metrics for PLS readability evaluation and should be adopted as best practice, with recommendations provided for improved evaluation standards.

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generate interactive UIs instead of just text responses, enabling more adaptive engagement and outperforming traditional chat interfaces in 70% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems are constrained by linear request-response formats that are inefficient for multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks.

Method: Proposes Generative Interfaces for Language Models framework that uses structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs.

Result: Generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases across diverse tasks and interaction patterns.

Conclusion: The findings clarify when and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction beyond traditional chat-based formats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

### [176] [Reasoning Steps as Curriculum: Using Depth of Thought as a Difficulty Signal for Tuning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18279)
*Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using depth of thought (DoT) - counting reasoning steps in teacher model traces - as a scalable, interpretable difficulty signal for curriculum learning in LLM training, with three testable hypotheses about its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for difficulty signals in curriculum learning that align with reasoning capabilities while remaining scalable and interpretable, moving beyond simple length-based metrics.

Method: Define difficulty as depth of thought (DoT) by counting discrete steps in teacher model's reasoning traces (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), then train with shallow to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT metric.

Result: Proposes three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii) DoT-ordered curricula outperform other methods under matched budgets, (iii) difficulty is robust across teacher models with light formatting controls.

Conclusion: Aims to establish cognitively grounded, interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training by using depth of thought as a scalable difficulty metric, with proposed evaluation framework and mitigation strategies for validity threats.

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-modal ML framework combining Sentence Transformer embeddings with attention-based seq2seq models to predict maritime object drift, outperforming physics-based and traditional ML methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of leeway object drift is critical for search and rescue operations, but remains challenging due to dynamic maritime conditions.

Method: Collects environmental/physical data, uses CNN on Navier-Stokes simulations to estimate drag/lift coefficients, then combines with textual descriptions in attention-based LSTM/Transformer models.

Result: Multi-modal models perform comparably to traditional methods while enabling longer-term forecasting (1-10 seconds) instead of single-step prediction.

Conclusion: Multi-modal modeling strategy provides accurate and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime environments.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

TL;DR: Machine learning approach for petroleum production forecasting using simple production/injection data without complex geological models, addressing concept drift and tested on synthetic and real Brazilian pre-salt data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable production forecasting and anticipate rock-fluid system behavior changes in petroleum reservoirs without depending on complex geological models or fluid property information.

Method: Data-driven approach using supervised learning methods (regressions and Neural Networks) with relevance analysis of production/injection variables, addressing concept drift through observation windows and retraining periodicity. Tested on synthetic data from UNISIM III model and real Brazilian pre-salt cases.

Result: Expected to design a reliable predictor for reservoir dynamics with rapid response, capable of handling practical difficulties like well restrictions and processing unit limitations.

Conclusion: The methodology aims to support reservoir management through production optimization, injection parameter optimization, and analysis of probabilistic events to maximize oil recovery.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fast depression detection system using 7-day app usage data collected in 1 second, achieving 82.4% accuracy with ML models for early identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depression detection systems require long data collection periods, making them ineffective for early detection where timely intervention is crucial.

Method: Developed a fast tool to retrieve 7-day app usage data in 1 second, collected data from 100 students, and built diverse ML models with feature selection approaches including stable FS and Boruta.

Result: Light gradient boosting machine achieved 82.4% accuracy in identifying depressed students with 75% precision. Parsimonious stacking model showed 77.4% precision using around 5 features.

Conclusion: The fast, minimalistic system can contribute to depression identification in underdeveloped regions and facilitate development of less resource-intensive systems.

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

TL;DR: NeuroPathX is an explainable deep learning framework that uses cross-attention mechanisms to analyze brain-gene interactions in neurological disorders, outperforming traditional methods while providing biological interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional imaging-genetics methods are limited to simplistic linear models or black-box techniques that lack interpretability, hindering understanding of complex brain-gene interactions in neurological disorders.

Method: Uses early fusion strategy with cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between brain structural variations (MRI) and biological pathways (genetics). Introduces two loss functions: sparsity loss for salient interactions and pathway similarity loss for consistent representations across cohort.

Result: Outperforms competing baseline approaches on autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Reveals biologically plausible associations linked to disorders.

Conclusion: NeuroPathX demonstrates potential to advance understanding of complex brain disorders through explainable deep learning that captures meaningful brain-gene interactions with biological interpretability.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

TL;DR: SALMAN is a unified robustness framework that evaluates transformer model stability using Distance Mapping Distortion measure without parameter modification or complex perturbation heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As pretrained transformer models grow larger and more deployed, their robustness under input perturbations becomes critical, but existing methods are labor-intensive and diverge between small and large models.

Method: Proposes a local robustness framework with novel Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure that compares input-to-output distance mappings in near-linear complexity to rank sample susceptibility.

Result: Demonstrates significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training performance.

Conclusion: SALMAN serves as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

*Avinash Amballa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoPE introduces complex-valued positional encoding where real part handles content and imaginary part handles position, achieving better performance with less computation than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Position encoding is crucial for transformers to model dependencies across sequence positions, but existing methods have limitations in efficiency and long-term decay.

Method: Replace traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings, using phase-aware attention in first layer followed by standard attention layers.

Result: CoPE doesn't exhibit long term decay, is compatible with linear attention, and achieves superior performance on GLUE benchmark with less computational complexity.

Conclusion: Complex positional encoding (CoPE) provides an effective and efficient alternative to traditional position encoding methods in transformers.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

TL;DR: DPO performance depends more on chosen response quality than rejected response quality. Theoretical analysis shows contrastiveness helps primarily by improving chosen samples. Online DPO effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on chosen responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what characteristics of preference data are most critical for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) performance, as this remains an open question despite DPO's growing adoption for aligning LLMs with human preferences.

Method: Systematic study combining theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across diverse tasks. Theoretical analysis characterizes optimal response distribution under DPO and examines online DPO setting. Empirical experiments test how chosen vs rejected response quality affects performance.

Result: Quality of chosen responses plays dominant role in optimizing DPO objective, while quality of rejected responses has relatively limited impact. Improving chosen response quality consistently boosts performance regardless of rejected response quality. Online DPO effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on chosen responses.

Conclusion: The study reveals that contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving chosen samples, not through rejection quality. Results provide practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets and explain mechanisms behind widely adopted DPO strategies.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EHR-based AI solutions often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting predictive performance and interpretability. There's a need to fully exploit the rich, multi-level structure of EHR data for better healthcare predictions.

Method: Uses large language models to extract semantic relationships among medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph. Designs hierarchical representation learning framework that captures contextualized representations across three levels (codes, visits, patients) with prototype information to capture intrinsic similarities.

Result: Evaluated on two public datasets across five clinical tasks (mortality, readmission, length of stay, drug recommendation, phenotype prediction). Demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ProtoEHR successfully enhances healthcare predictions by fully leveraging EHR hierarchical structure, providing both accurate results and interpretable insights at code, visit, and patient levels to support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High dropout rates in distance education require proactive identification of at-risk students, but data privacy concerns and institutional silos often prevent effective early-warning systems.

Method: Developed machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Network) using Federated Learning framework on OULAD dataset, comparing model complexity and data balancing techniques.

Result: The federated model achieved strong predictive performance with approximately 85% ROC AUC score in identifying at-risk students.

Conclusion: Federated Learning provides a practical and scalable solution for building effective early-warning systems that enable proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy constraints.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZTFed-MAS2S is a zero-trust federated learning framework that combines secure parameter transmission with accurate wind power data imputation using multi-head attention sequence-to-sequence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind power data often has missing values due to sensor faults and unstable transmission, while federated learning faces vulnerabilities to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange in open industrial environments.

Method: Integrates verifiable differential privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, confidentiality/integrity verification, dynamic trust-aware aggregation via similarity graphs, and sparsity/quantization compression. Uses multi-head attention sequence-to-sequence model for imputation.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world wind farm datasets show superiority in both federated learning performance and missing data imputation accuracy.

Conclusion: ZTFed-MAS2S provides a secure and efficient solution for practical energy sector applications, ensuring privacy preservation and robust performance in zero-trust environments.

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

### [188] [Linear cost mutual information estimation and independence test of similar performance as HSIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18338)
*Jarek Duda,Jagoda Bracha,Adrian Przybysz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCR (Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction) is a linear-cost alternative to HSIC for statistical dependency evaluation, offering higher sensitivity and providing joint distribution models through mixed moment features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIC requires O(n^2.37) computational complexity for n-sized data samples, making it impractical for large datasets. There is a need for more efficient dependency evaluation methods.

Method: HCR uses hierarchical correlation reconstruction with linear O(n) time complexity per feature. It describes dependencies through mixed moment features (starting with correlation and homoscedasticity) and can approximate mutual information as sum of squares of nontrivial mixed moments.

Result: HCR provides a practical alternative with linear computational cost, higher dependence sensitivity in tests, and the ability to model joint distributions through dependency-describing features.

Conclusion: HCR offers a scalable solution for statistical dependency evaluation that is more efficient than HSIC while providing additional benefits like joint distribution modeling and mutual information approximation.

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DualSparse-MoE introduces post-training expert partitioning and dual sparsity optimization to improve Mixture of Experts efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE architectures face efficiency challenges due to massive computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns despite their sparsity benefits.

Method: Post-training expert partitioning to induce tensor-level sparsity without retraining, combined with dynamic tensor-level computation dropping and static neuron-level reconstruction.

Result: 25% drop rate reduces accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three MoE models while achieving proportional computational speedups. Load-imbalance awareness achieves 1.41x speedup with 0.5% accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: DualSparse-MoE enables efficient MoE deployment through dual sparsity optimization, delivering significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy impact.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Motivation: To provide a mathematical basis for deep learning theory by leveraging the strong theoretical foundations of low-rank tensor decompositions, which have close connections to neural networks and offer uniqueness guarantees and polynomial-time algorithms.

Method: The paper presents a comprehensive review and unified overview of existing approaches from different communities (computer science, mathematics) that use low-rank tensor decompositions to theoretically explain various aspects of deep neural network performance.

Result: The review demonstrates that low-rank tensor methods play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining deep neural network performance, including expressivity, algorithmic learnability, computational hardness, generalization, and identifiability.

Conclusion: Low-rank tensor decompositions provide a powerful mathematical framework for deep learning theory, offering a unified perspective that bridges different research communities and opens broader applications for understanding neural networks through tensor methods.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning struggles in environments with extreme sparse rewards due to infrequent positive feedback, requiring more efficient exploration and guidance mechanisms.

Method: Integrated Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR) using VAEs to reward state novelty with LLM-derived intrinsic rewards based on environment and goal descriptions, implemented with Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in MiniGrid DoorKey environment.

Result: The combined strategy significantly increased agent performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy individually or standard A2C, which failed to learn completely.

Conclusion: The combination effectively complements different aspects: VSIMR drives exploration of new states while LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation towards goals, making it a promising approach for sparse reward RL problems.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling Bayesian Optimization to high-dimensional spaces is challenging. Existing TuRBO method uses local GPs which reduces sampling efficiency compared to global GPs. Need to enhance sampling efficiency while preserving heterogeneous modeling.

Method: Construct multiple local quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new sample points by solving bound-constrained quadratic programs. Addresses vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.

Result: Method enhances efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of high-dimensional BO techniques on both synthetic functions and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines the benefits of global GP modeling with local trust region optimization, providing improved sampling efficiency and performance in high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware description languages like Verilog remain underexplored in code generation due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity, creating a need for specialized approaches.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement learning framework with Veribench-53K dataset, Trace-back based Rescore mechanism for reliable feedback, sample-balanced weighting strategy to prevent forgetting, and iterative RL pipeline co-evolving policy and reward models.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness, outperforming approaches like CraftRTL and DeepSeek-style methods.

Conclusion: The RL-driven approach shows strong potential for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains, achieving superior results with a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection methods struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and poor generalization to novel anomaly types in time series data.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework integrating dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning with adaptive reward mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches on Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 benchmark datasets with high precision and recall.

Conclusion: The DRTA framework provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks in low-label systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Motivation: The role of systematic augmentation design in machine unlearning remains under-investigated, despite known connections between memorization and augmentation.

Method: Investigated impact of different data augmentation strategies (including TrivialAug) on unlearning methods like SalUn, Random Label, and Fine-Tuning, tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with varying forget rates.

Result: Proper augmentation design significantly improved unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models by up to 40.12% with TrivialAug augmentation.

Result: RL-based initialization significantly enhances convergence speed and final solution quality across various noise conditions and tasks, with multiple RL approaches achieving comparable performance gains

Conclusion: RL-driven parameter initialization offers a promising approach to accelerate scalability and practical deployment of VQAs by addressing barren plateau problems through machine learning integration

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

*Anastasis Kratsios,Dennis Zvigelsky,Bradd Hart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks can exactly emulate any reasoning circuit (Boolean, tropical, arithmetic, etc.) using ReLU activations, demonstrating no reasoning task is beyond their reach. The construction trades circuit runtime for neural network size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify what forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained, by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation problems.

Method: A meta-algorithm that converts any circuit into a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator, ensuring exact emulation without approximation.

Result: Neural networks can exactly emulate various circuits including shortest-path algorithms (cubic size), stopped Turing machines (quadratic size), and randomized Boolean circuits, proving superior to classical universal approximation theorems.

Conclusion: Neural networks can perform any reasoning task defined by circuits, trading algorithmic runtime for space complexity (number of neurons), and this capability strictly exceeds classical universal approximation.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

### [198] [BTW: A Non-Parametric Variance Stabilization Framework for Multimodal Model Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18551)
*Jun Hou,Le Wang,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BTW is a parameter-free bi-level weighting framework that uses KL divergence and mutual information to dynamically adjust modality importance in multimodal learning, handling noise and scaling to arbitrary modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like Partial Information Decomposition struggle with more than two modalities and lack instance-level control, especially when additional modalities introduce noise rather than useful information.

Method: Combines instance-level KL divergence (measuring divergence between unimodal and multimodal predictions) and modality-level mutual information (estimating global alignment) to dynamically weight modalities during training without additional parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical classification show significant improvements in regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Conclusion: BTW provides an effective, scalable solution for multimodal learning that handles noisy modalities and enables instance-level control without parameter overhead.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

*Åukasz JanisiÃ³w,Marek KochaÅczyk,Bartosz ZieliÅski,Tomasz Danel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual masking framework replaces masked molecular substructures with chemically reasonable fragments from generative models, providing more realistic and actionable explanations for molecular property predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable AI methods for molecular property prediction rely on masking strategies that remove atoms/features, but these often fail to adhere to molecular distribution and yield unintuitive explanations.

Method: Propose counterfactual masking that replaces masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from generative models trained to complete molecular graphs, evaluating predictions relative to counterfactual molecules from the data distribution.

Result: Method provides molecular realism for robust explanations and meaningful counterfactuals that indicate how structural modifications affect properties. Well-suited for benchmarking model explainers and yields actionable insights across multiple datasets and property prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

TL;DR: This paper extends previous graphon-signal analysis of MPNNs by addressing limitations in handling multidimensional signals, readout functions, generalization bounds, and non-symmetric graphons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work by Levie on graphon-signal analysis of MPNNs had limitations that restricted its practical applicability in graph machine learning settings.

Method: The authors introduce several refinements: extending results to multidimensional signals, improving Lipschitz continuity for MPNNs with readout functions, enhancing generalization bounds using robustness-type analysis, and extending to non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Result: The paper provides more comprehensive theoretical foundations for MPNNs that better align with practical graph machine learning scenarios.

Conclusion: These extensions address key shortcomings in previous graphon-signal analysis, making the theoretical framework more applicable to real-world graph learning problems.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPF framework enables multi-step learning with one-step training, balancing short/long-term accuracy while reducing memory usage compared to autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-driven forecasting methods suffer from error accumulation in long-term predictions, and autoregressive training requires large GPU memory while potentially sacrificing short-term performance.

Method: Stochastic PushForward (SPF) builds supplementary dataset from model predictions and combines with ground truth via stochastic acquisition strategy. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs to maintain stable memory usage.

Result: Experiments on Burgers' equation and Shallow Water benchmark show SPF achieves higher long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory requirements.

Conclusion: SPF is promising for resource-limited and complex simulations as it maintains stable memory usage while improving long-term forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on protein language model embeddings enable effective low-data protein function prediction and design, outperforming baseline models with as few as 24 sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein function prediction remains challenging in data-scarce regimes, limiting machine learning-guided protein design. While protein language models provide evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders offer interpretable latent decompositions, their effectiveness for low-data function prediction and design hasn't been systematically studied.

Method: Evaluated SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2 embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks. Compared SAE performance against ESM2 baselines using limited sequence data (as few as 24 sequences).

Result: SAEs consistently outperform or compete with ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating their sparse latent space encodes compact, biologically meaningful representations that generalize better from limited data. Steering predictive latents exploits biological motifs, yielding top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to ESM2 alone.

Conclusion: SAEs provide an effective approach for low-data protein function prediction and design, offering improved generalization and biological interpretability compared to standard protein language model embeddings.

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Motivation: Early prediction of drug approval outcomes is critical for optimizing research investments, but existing ML/DL methods have limited interpretability which constrains their impact in drug discovery.

Method: Built on LLaMA architecture with GRPO fine-tuning, DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved/unapproved compounds to generate predictions with rationales and confidence scores.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.732 and F1 score of 0.729 on validation set, 0.725/0.718 on test set, outperforming conventional baselines. On external dataset, achieved AUC 0.728 and F1 0.774, outperforming both baselines and ChemAP model.

Conclusion: DrugReasoner delivers competitive predictive accuracy while enhancing transparency through reasoning outputs, demonstrating the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhymeRL is a novel RL system for LLMs that addresses GPU underutilization by leveraging historical rollout similarity through speculative decoding and two-tier scheduling, achieving 2.6x performance improvement without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL systems for LLMs suffer from significant GPU underutilization due to rollout stage dominance and imbalanced rollout lengths, while existing solutions compromise training accuracy for efficiency.

Method: RhymeRL introduces two key innovations: 1) HistoSpec - a speculative decoding inference engine using historical rollout token similarity for accurate drafts, and 2) HistoPipe - a two-tier scheduling strategy leveraging historical rollout distribution similarity to balance workload.

Result: RhymeRL demonstrates scalability from dozens to thousands of GPUs in production environments and achieves 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Leveraging historical rollout similarity through speculative decoding and intelligent scheduling can significantly accelerate RL training for LLMs while maintaining accuracy, providing an effective solution to GPU underutilization problems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Motivation: Principal portfolio approaches in signal-based trading lack diversification and robustness when exploring prediction matrix features across different market situations.

Method: Develops a novel linear trading position with sparse spectrum to explore larger spectral regions of prediction matrix, using Krasnosel'skiÃ¯-Mann fixed-point algorithm for optimization with descent property and linear convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method achieves good and robust performance across various market situations.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse spectrum trading position with fixed-point optimization provides improved diversification, robustness, and theoretical convergence guarantees for principal portfolio trading strategies.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of distribution shifts in time series data between training and testing datasets, aiming to improve model generalization and robustness across domains.

Method: Combines multi-scale mixed input architecture for feature extraction at different scales with uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning using Dirichlet prior for both target prediction and uncertainty estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets with significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.

Conclusion: The combined approach of mixed input architecture with uncertainty awareness mechanism is highly effective for unsupervised domain adaptation in time series data, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRATA-TS is a framework that uses selective transfer learning with target-aware retrieval and LLM reasoning to improve time series forecasting in data-scarce urban environments, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban forecasting models face severe data imbalance where few cities have rich historical data while many have sparse records. Direct transfer learning risks negative transfer and noise introduction.

Method: Uses patch-based temporal encoder to find semantically aligned source subsequences, then employs LLM for retrieval-guided reasoning over target inputs and retrieved support, with distillation into compact models.

Result: Extensive experiments on parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow show consistent outperformance over strong forecasting and transfer baselines.

Conclusion: STRATA-TS provides effective selective knowledge transfer with interpretable pathways, demonstrating superior performance in scarce data regimes while enabling efficient deployment.

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BDVAE is a biologically structured deep learning model that integrates multi-omics data to predict immune checkpoint inhibitor response and uncover resistance mechanisms, achieving high accuracy (AUC-ROC = 0.94) while providing interpretable biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models for predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor responses lack interpretability and fail to effectively utilize the biological structure in multi-omics data, limiting understanding of resistance mechanisms.

Method: Developed Biologically Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE) with modality- and pathway-specific encoders using variational inference to learn biologically meaningful latent features from transcriptomic and genomic data.

Result: Achieved high prediction accuracy (AUC-ROC = 0.94) on pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients, identified key resistance mechanisms including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal signaling, and revealed resistance as a continuous biological spectrum.

Conclusion: BDVAE demonstrates the value of biologically structured machine learning for generating interpretable, clinically relevant insights into complex resistance patterns, potentially guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

TL;DR: Novel multimodal framework combining text sentiment and vocal cues from earnings calls predicts stock volatility but not returns, with acoustic features from executive speech transitions explaining 43.8% of volatility variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Information asymmetry in financial markets is amplified by strategically crafted corporate narratives, undermining conventional textual analysis. There's a need to decode latent uncertainty markers from verifiable biometric signals.

Method: Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM) applies nonlinear acoustics to extract emotional signatures from executive vocal tract dynamics. Both acoustic and textual features are projected onto a 3D Affective State Label space (Tension, Stability, Arousal) using 1,795 earnings calls dataset.

Result: Multimodal features explain up to 43.8% of out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility, but do not forecast directional stock returns. Key drivers: reduced textual stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and arousal variability from CEOs during speech transitions.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach substantially outperforms financials-only baseline, providing investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty through verifiable biometric signals.

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning foundation models under privacy and resource constraints is critical for AGI progress, especially when high-quality data resides on distributed edge devices. LoRA-based federated fine-tuning faces limitations in heterogeneous FL environments including structural incompatibility across clients and poor adaptability to non-IID data distributions.

Method: Proposes FFT MoE framework that replaces LoRA with sparse Mixture of Experts adapters. Each client trains a lightweight gating network to selectively activate personalized expert subsets, enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while maintaining aggregation compatibility. Introduces heterogeneity-aware auxiliary loss to dynamically regularize routing distribution for expert diversity and balanced utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments across both IID and non-IID conditions show FFT MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: FFT MoE effectively addresses the limitations of LoRA-based federated fine-tuning in heterogeneous environments through sparse MoE adapters and dynamic routing regularization, achieving superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

### [211] [Auditing Approximate Machine Unlearning for Differentially Private Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18671)
*Yuechun Gu,Jiajie He,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Existing approximate machine unlearning methods may compromise privacy of retained samples in differentially private models, requiring new differentially private unlearning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy onion effect where unlearning specific data might affect retained samples' privacy, especially in differentially private models where this impact hasn't been studied.

Method: Proposed holistic auditing approach for both unlearned and retained samples using differential privacy and membership inference attacks criteria. Developed efficient A-LiRA MIA with data augmentation to reduce shadow model training costs.

Result: Experimental findings show existing approximate unlearning algorithms inadvertently compromise retained samples' privacy in differentially private models.

Conclusion: Differentially private unlearning algorithms are needed to properly protect privacy of both unlearned and retained samples in machine learning models.

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

### [212] [Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18672)
*Taishi Nakamura,Satoki Ishikawa,Masaki Kawamura,Takumi Okamoto,Daisuke Nohara,Jun Suzuki,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE scaling laws show that while memorization improves with total parameters, reasoning performance saturates and can regress despite training loss improvements, with sparsity affecting generalization gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws don't account for MoE sparsity dimensions, and there's a need to understand how sparsity affects different capability regimes (memorization vs reasoning) in large language models.

Method: Trained families of MoE Transformers varying total parameters, active parameters, and top-k routing while keeping compute fixed. Measured pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and accuracy to separate generalization gaps.

Result: Memorization improves with total parameters, but reasoning performance saturates/regresses despite training loss gains. Top-k changes alone have little effect, and traditional hyperparameters affect generalization similarly to sparsity.

Conclusion: MoE sparsity introduces distinct scaling behaviors where reasoning capabilities don't scale linearly with parameters, and neither RLHF nor extra compute can fix reasoning deficits from excessive sparsity.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

### [213] [Utilizing Training Data to Improve LLM Reasoning for Tabular Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18676)
*Chufan Gao,Jintai Chen,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRTab is a prompting-based approach that combines training data learning with retrieval to improve tabular reasoning, outperforming previous methods while being interpretable and cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either fine-tune LLMs (losing generalizability) or use training-free prompting (not leveraging training data). LRTab aims to integrate both benefits by learning from training data through prompting and retrieving relevant insights.

Method: 1) Obtain chain-of-thought responses from training data 2) For incorrect responses, predict Prompt Conditions to avoid errors 3) Validate Prompt Conditions 4) Retrieve relevant Prompt Conditions at inference for additional context

Result: Comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact show LRTab outperforms previous baselines in tabular reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LRTab successfully combines the advantages of both fine-tuning and training-free approaches, providing an interpretable and cost-efficient solution for tabular reasoning that leverages training data insights through retrieval.

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end deep learning framework for sepsis detection using autoencoder feature extraction and MLP classifier, outperforming traditional ML methods with 74.6-93.5% accuracy across ICU cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML methods struggle with irregular, incomplete time-series EHR data and require manual feature engineering for sepsis detection in ICU settings.

Method: Unsupervised autoencoder for automatic feature extraction + multilayer perceptron classifier, with customized down sampling strategy and dynamic sliding window for real-time inference. Uses fixed dimension vectors with missingness indicators.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 74.6%, 80.6%, and 93.5% across three ICU cohorts, consistently outperforming traditional ML baselines (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Conclusion: Framework demonstrates superior robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

*V. S. Usatyuk,D. A. Sapoznikov,S. I. Egorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology achieves efficient multi-class image classification using physics-inspired embeddings with massive compression and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop highly efficient image classification by combining insights from statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology to create compressed yet powerful feature representations.

Method: High-dimensional features from MobileNetV2 are interpreted as spins on a sparse MET-QC-LDPC graph forming a Random-Bond Ising Model. The system operates at Nishimori temperature where Bethe-Hessian matrix's smallest eigenvalue vanishes. Topology-guided graph design uses spherical/toroidal ensembles with permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets.

Result: Achieves 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100 with 40x parameter compression (1280D features compressed to 32-64D). Six-fold speed-up in beta_N estimation compared to bisection.

Conclusion: Topology-guided graph design enables highly efficient physics-inspired embeddings that maintain state-of-the-art performance despite massive compression, demonstrating the power of interdisciplinary approaches combining physics, coding theory, and topology.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

*Yi Liu,Hongji Zhang,Yiwen Wang,Dimitris Tsaras,Lei Chen,Mingxuan Yuan,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructRTL is a novel structure-aware graph self-supervised learning framework that uses control data flow graphs (CDFGs) to improve RTL design quality estimation, outperforming previous LLM-based approaches by incorporating structural semantics and knowledge distillation from post-mapping netlists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for RTL quality estimation overlook structural semantics that are essential for accurate predictions. CDFGs provide richer structural characteristics that offer better cues for representation learning compared to pure code embeddings.

Method: Proposes StructRTL framework that learns structure-informed representations from CDFGs using graph self-supervised learning. Incorporates knowledge distillation to transfer low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the CDFG predictor.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior methods on various RTL design quality estimation tasks. Establishes new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating effectiveness of combining structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

Conclusion: The combination of structure-aware learning from CDFGs and knowledge distillation from post-mapping netlists provides superior RTL quality estimation performance, addressing limitations of previous LLM-based approaches that ignored structural semantics.

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

*Enrique MÃ¡rmol Campos,Aurora GonzÃ¡lez Vidal,JosÃ© Luis HernÃ¡ndez Ramos,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAegis is a two-stage defense framework for Federated Learning that detects Byzantine clients using symbolic time series transformation and spectral clustering, with FFT-based aggregation to mitigate undetected attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning's decentralized nature makes it vulnerable to Byzantine clients that can poison training through false model updates, compromising model integrity and performance.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Uses Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) to transform model updates and amplify differences between benign/malicious clients, 2) Applies spectral clustering for accurate detection, and 3) Implements FFT-based aggregation as final defense layer.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art defenses against five poisoning attacks (including label flipping and adaptive optimization-based strategies), achieving higher detection precision and final model accuracy even under strong adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: FLAegis provides robust protection against Byzantine attacks in FL systems through effective detection and mitigation mechanisms, maintaining high performance across various attack scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

### [218] [Stability and Generalization for Bellman Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18741)
*Enoch H. Kang,Kyoungseok Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides statistical analysis of Bellman residual minimization (BRM) in offline RL/IRL, achieving O(1/n) excess risk bound without variance reduction or restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline RL and inverse RL methods struggle with Bellman consistency, and while BRM with SGDA shows promise, its statistical behavior in offline settings remains largely unexplored.

Method: Introduces a single Lyapunov potential that couples SGDA runs on neighboring datasets, enabling analysis of stability and sample complexity for BRM with standard neural networks and minibatch SGD.

Result: Achieves O(1/n) on-average argument-stability bound (doubling best known sample-complexity exponent) and O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM without variance reduction or restrictive sampling assumptions.

Conclusion: The analysis closes the statistical gap for BRM in offline settings, providing strong theoretical guarantees for practical implementations with standard neural networks and SGD.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: A constraint-based model reduction approach for MILP that identifies critical inequality constraints to transform into equalities, improving solution quality by 50% and reducing computation time by 17.47%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing MILP model reduction methods focus on variable reduction, while constraint reduction has been largely ignored despite its potential to reduce complexity from a dual perspective.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal representation technique that identifies critical tight-constraints at optimal solutions using both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations, with a heuristic rule to select critical constraints.

Result: Experimental results show 50% improvement in solution quality and 17.47% reduction in computation time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Constraint-based model reduction is an effective approach for accelerating large-scale MILP solving, with significant performance improvements over existing variable reduction methods.

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

TL;DR: UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models using significantly lower memory access through architectural improvements including memory layers in every block, simplified value processing, and optimized computation ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts models suffer from high memory access costs during inference, while previous memory-layer architectures like UltraMem only matched 2-expert MoE performance, falling short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations.

Method: Five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections, adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.

Result: UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and parameters but with significantly lower memory access. Shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks: +1.6 points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization, and +7.9 points on in-context learning.

Conclusion: Memory-layer architectures now achieve performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, providing a compelling alternative for efficient sparse computation. Activation density has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count.

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

TL;DR: GaaS is a modular governance service that enforces policies on AI agents at runtime without requiring agent cooperation, using declarative rules and trust scoring to block high-risk behaviors while maintaining system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution and multi-agent coordination, existing oversight mechanisms are reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.

Method: Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) employs declarative rules and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive interventions with graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.

Result: Evaluation across three simulation regimes with open-source models (LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) shows GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving throughput. Trust scores effectively track rule adherence and isolate untrustworthy components.

Conclusion: GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent ecosystems by positioning governance as a runtime service that enforces ethics rather than teaching them, providing scalable and decoupled governance for distributed AI systems.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

*Adam Breitholtz,Edvin Listo Zec,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies federated learning with heterogeneous client label sets, comparing public vs private label settings and proposing adaptations of standard FL methods that maintain performance while increasing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous client label sets are common in real-world FL applications but rarely studied, especially when labels are private (shared only with central server rather than among clients).

Method: Applied classical classifier combination methods with centralized tuning, adapted common FL methods for private label settings, and conducted experiments comparing public vs private label scenarios.

Result: Reducing labels per client substantially harms performance. Centralized tuning helps but increases variance. Adapted FL methods perform similarly in private setting as standard methods in public setting.

Conclusion: Clients can achieve increased privacy (private label sets) with little cost to model accuracy through the proposed FL method adaptations.

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

*Junyu Yan,Feng Chen,Yuyang Xue,Yuning Du,Konstantinos Vilouras,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Steven McDonagh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWiFT is a debiasing framework that efficiently improves ML model fairness while preserving performance using minimal data and fine-tuning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models exhibit bias in sensitive domains like healthcare, negatively impacting fairness and generalization while amplifying social discrimination. Existing debiasing methods require extensive retraining and show trade-offs between fairness and performance.

Method: Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT) identifies parameter contributions to bias vs performance, then uses a two-step fine-tuning process with different gradient flows based on each parameter's contribution. Requires only small external dataset and few epochs.

Result: Extensive experiments across dermatological and chest X-ray datasets with gender, skin tone, and age attributes show SWiFT consistently reduces bias while achieving competitive/superior diagnostic accuracy. Demonstrates improved generalization on OOD datasets.

Conclusion: SWiFT provides an efficient debiasing solution that addresses limitations of existing methods by requiring minimal data/training while maintaining both fairness and performance, with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRL-based malware detection agent that simultaneously optimizes classification and rejection for manual labeling, achieving significant performance improvements in concept drift scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional malware classifiers struggle with concept drift and lack mechanisms to optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation in evolving threat environments.

Method: Formulated malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and trained a deep reinforcement learning agent to jointly optimize classification performance and reject high-risk samples for manual labeling.

Result: DRMD agent achieved 5.18Â±5.44, 14.49Â±12.86, and 10.06Â±10.81 average AUT performance improvement over baseline approaches in different settings, showing improved resilience to concept drift.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning can effectively facilitate malware detection and improve resiliency to concept drift in dynamic Android malware environments, outperforming standard classification approaches.

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

*Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Jalal Etesami,Pouria Fatemi,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new bandit model where users compare consumed items with historical items, achieving O(âT) regret through informative queries and initial random exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional contextual duelling bandits only capture implicit choices but don't utilize post-consumption comparisons, which provide more reliable feedback from users.

Method: Algorithm recommends one item per time step; after consumption, user compares it with a historical item. Uses initial random exploration to build diverse history and matrix concentration bounds for analysis.

Result: Achieves O(âT) regret guarantees. Simulations show significantly lower regret compared to methods that only compare simultaneously recommended items.

Conclusion: Reusing past items for comparisons without additional regret cost leads to better performance, with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits demonstrated through simulations.

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

TL;DR: C-Flat is a plug-and-play method that promotes flatter loss landscapes in continual learning, improving performance across various CL paradigms with an efficient extension called C-Flat++ that reduces update costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpness-aware minimization in continual learning may favor sharper minima over flatter ones, leading to less robust solutions. The paper aims to develop a method that specifically promotes flatter loss landscapes tailored for CL.

Method: Proposes C-Flat, a method that promotes flatter loss landscapes for continual learning with plug-and-play compatibility. Also introduces C-Flat++, an efficient framework with selective flatness-driven promotion to reduce update costs.

Result: C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of CL settings, methods, datasets, and scenarios. C-Flat++ significantly reduces update costs while maintaining effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed C-Flat and C-Flat++ approaches demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency in continual learning by promoting flatter loss landscapes, offering easy integration and improved performance across diverse CL scenarios.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

*Yunyang Cao,Juekai Lin,Wenhao Li,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOCHA is a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in temporal point processes that models time-varying causal structures through learnable DAGs with acyclicity constraints, achieving state-of-the-art event prediction while providing interpretable causal insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for causal discovery in temporal point processes rely on static or first-order causal structures, which overlook the multi-order and time-varying nature of real-world causal relationships in event sequences.

Method: MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a latent time-evolving graph using a time-varying directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights. It enforces acyclicity and sparsity constraints and uses an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal discovery and TPP dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MOCHA achieves state-of-the-art performance in event prediction and reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Conclusion: MOCHA successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by modeling multi-order dynamic causality, providing both accurate event prediction and interpretable causal discovery in temporal point processes.

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAEPO is a new policy optimization method that uses history-aware exploratory loss with cumulative logarithmic likelihoods and Plackett-Luce softmax to improve exploration in long-horizon tasks, outperforming existing methods like PPO, GRPO, and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DPO and GRPO often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks by either leveraging full sequence log-likelihoods or aggregating per-token ratios, which restricts thorough exploration needed for complex learning environments.

Method: HAEPO compresses trajectories into cumulative logarithmic likelihoods, applies Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories for normalized weights proportional to returns, and adds entropy regularization and soft KL penalty for stability against a frozen reference policy.

Result: HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior that is better or on par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework that explicitly leverages full-trajectory history while effectively balancing exploration and stability in policy optimization.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

TL;DR: DNP improves Neural Processes by combining global and distance-aware local latent structures with bi-Lipschitz regularization for better uncertainty calibration and OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Neural Processes struggle with uncertainty calibration and capturing local data dependencies, needing improved modeling of both global task variations and local input relationships.

Method: Introduces global latent variable for task-level variations and local latent variable in distance-preserving latent space using bi-Lipschitz regularization to bound input relationship distortions.

Result: Achieves strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across regression and classification tasks, better distinguishing in-distribution from out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: DNP successfully addresses limitations of standard NPs by combining global and local latent structures with distance preservation, resulting in superior uncertainty estimation and OOD detection capabilities.

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work only covered linear dynamics or Neural Controlled ODEs with sampling interval dependence. Need to understand generalization error for broader class of nonlinear neural ODEs.

Method: Analyze neural ODEs with Lipschitz continuous nonlinear dynamics functions, show solutions have bounded variations, and establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and time-independent cases.

Result: Derived generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear dynamics, investigated impact of overparameterization and domain constraints on these bounds.

Conclusion: Successfully established first generalization bounds for neural ODEs with nonlinear dynamics, providing theoretical foundation for understanding their generalization performance.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular structure generation is crucial for biological applications like molecular docking and protein folding. Recent generative models have shown progress but there's room for improvement in training and inference efficiency.

Method: Adopts energy-based perspective for flow matching, learning a deep network that iteratively maps random configurations from source distribution to target structures in the data manifold.

Result: Outperforms recent baselines of task-associated flow matching and diffusion models in protein docking and protein backbone generation experiments using similar computational budget.

Conclusion: The energy-based flow matching approach yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective setup with theoretical justification and connections to fundamental properties like idempotency and stability.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar

*Laurence A. F. Park,Jesse Read*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, Staged Logit) for measuring conditional label covariance in multilabel data, finding all perform similarly but with false detection issues, with Multivariate Probit having lowest error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilabel data analysis requires understanding label dependence, but existing methods like multivariate Probit may not reliably estimate constant vs dependent covariance due to copula covariance estimation limitations.

Method: Compared three statistical models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, and Staged Logit) through experiments to observe their performance in measuring conditional label covariance, evaluating both constant and dependent covariance scenarios.

Result: All three models measured constant and dependent covariance equally well depending on covariance strength, but all falsely detected dependent covariance when constant covariance was actually present. Multivariate Probit model showed the lowest error rate among the three.

Conclusion: While all tested models can measure conditional covariance, they suffer from false positive detection of dependent covariance. Multivariate Probit appears to be the most reliable option despite the limitations, highlighting the need for careful model selection in multilabel dependence analysis.

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Conclusion: Koopman embeddings capture reusable dynamical structure rather than task-specific patterns, supporting their use as a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations

TL;DR: PAX-TS is a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm for explaining time series forecasting models through localized input perturbations, providing multi-granular explanations and capturing cross-channel correlations in multivariate forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern forecasting models like transformers and large language models are opaque and lack explainability, while existing methods like LIME are unsuitable for time series forecasting contexts.

Method: Based on localized input perturbations to generate multi-granular explanations, capable of characterizing cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts.

Result: Explanations effectively capture model behavior (differences between high/low-performing algorithms), identified 6 classes of patterns across datasets/algorithms that serve as performance indicators with noticeable error differences.

Conclusion: PAX-TS enables detailed illustration of forecasting model mechanisms and provides practical explanations that can answer questions about forecasts, including cross-channel correlation analysis.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

*Md Anwar Hossen,Fatema Siddika,Wensheng Zhang,Anuj Sharma,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedProtoKD is a novel heterogeneous federated learning method that addresses prototype margin-shrinking problems through dual-knowledge distillation and contrastive learning, achieving significant accuracy improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based HFL methods suffer from sub-optimal global knowledge due to weighted averaging of prototypes, causing prototype shrinking that negatively impacts performance in heterogeneous models and extremely non-IID data scenarios.

Method: FedProtoKD uses enhanced dual-knowledge distillation with clients' logits and prototype feature representation, employs contrastive learning-based trainable server prototype with class-wise adaptive prototype margin, and assesses public sample importance based on prototype closeness to class representatives.

Result: The method achieved average improvements of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD effectively resolves the prototype margin-shrinking problem in heterogeneous federated learning through its innovative dual-knowledge distillation and adaptive prototype margin approach, demonstrating superior performance over current methods.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

*Gary Simethy,Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo,Petar Durdevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDiff reframes time series imputation as learning system evolution using a conditional diffusion model with causal bias, outperforming window-based methods especially for long gaps in industrial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods treat imputation as pattern completion within fixed time windows, which fails in industrial systems with non-stationary dynamics, control actions, and long uninterrupted gaps.

Method: STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control/environmental inputs.

Result: On wastewater treatment data with simulated gaps, STDiff achieves lowest errors with advantage increasing for longer gaps. On raw industrial data with real gaps, it produces dynamically plausible trajectories while window-based models flatten or over-smooth.

Conclusion: Dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation is a robust approach for industrial time series, with STDiff demonstrating superior performance for handling long gaps and maintaining system dynamics.

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

*Luis Mantilla CalderÃ³n,AlÃ¡n Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physical system using springs and sticks can approximate any continuous function through piecewise-linear approximation and energy minimization, performing comparably to neural networks while revealing thermodynamic learning barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand learning as a physical process by creating a simple mechanical system that can perform function approximation and study its thermodynamic properties.

Method: Use sticks for piecewise-linear function approximation, springs to encode mean squared error loss, and converge to minimum-energy configurations through dissipation. Apply to regression tasks and analyze thermodynamic properties.

Result: The system performs comparably to multi-layer perceptrons on regression tasks. Found a thermodynamic learning barrier where environmental fluctuations prevent learning if free energy change hits a certain threshold.

Conclusion: This simple physical model provides insights into learning systems from a thermodynamic perspective, revealing fundamental barriers to learning caused by environmental fluctuations.

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

*Kelly Kurowski,Xixi Lu,Hajo A Reijers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores resource-centric next-activity prediction in process mining, showing that LightGBM and Transformer models perform best with 2-gram activity encoding, while Random Forest benefits from combined 2-gram and repetition features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While existing predictive process monitoring focuses on control-flow perspective, this research investigates next-activity prediction from a resource-centric viewpoint to enable better work organization, workload balancing, and capacity forecasting.

Method: Evaluated four prediction models (LightGBM, Transformer, Random Forest, and baseline) with three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets, focusing on resource-centric features including 2-gram activity transitions and activity repetition patterns.

Result: LightGBM and Transformer models performed best with 2-gram activity transition encoding, while Random Forest achieved optimal performance with combined 2-gram transitions and activity repetition features. The combined encoding achieved the highest average accuracy.

Conclusion: Resource-centric next-activity prediction shows significant potential for enabling smarter resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee support, opening new research directions in predictive process monitoring.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

TL;DR: A novel active learning framework using similarity search and attention-based autoencoder for APT detection, with evaluation of various similarity metrics showing significant impact on detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of stealthy APT behavior and extreme class imbalance in cyber defense datasets through improved anomaly detection with minimal supervision.

Method: Active learning-based anomaly detection framework leveraging similarity search with Attention-Based Autoencoder, using feature-space similarity to identify normal/anomaly instances and iteratively refine decision space.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets (including DARPA APT traces) show similarity metric choice significantly impacts model convergence, detection accuracy, and label efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines for threat intelligence and cyber defense applications.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

### [244] [GRADSTOP: Early Stopping of Gradient Descent via Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19028)
*Arash Jamshidi,Lauri SeppÃ¤lÃ¤inen,Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich,Hoang Phuc Hau Luu,Anton BjÃ¶rklund,Kai PuolamÃ¤ki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradStop is a novel early stopping method that uses gradient information instead of validation sets to prevent overfitting, allowing full dataset usage for training with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional early stopping requires hold-out validation sets which reduce training data. This is problematic in data-limited settings like transfer learning where every sample is valuable.

Method: Estimates Bayesian posterior using gradient information from training, defines early stopping as sampling from this posterior, and uses the approximated posterior to derive a stopping criterion.

Result: Achieves small test loss and performs comparably to validation-set-based methods while using the entire dataset for training, particularly beneficial in data-limited scenarios.

Conclusion: GradStop provides an effective alternative to validation-based early stopping by leveraging freely available gradient information, enabling full dataset utilization with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

### [245] [When recalling in-context, Transformers are not SSMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19029)
*Destiny Okpekpe,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern recurrent models like SSMs face optimization challenges and scaling limitations compared to transformers, particularly on associative recall tasks, with learning rate sensitivity and architectural differences affecting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why modern recurrent models (e.g., state-space models) underperform transformers on reasoning and memorization tasks like associative recall, despite their subquadratic complexity advantages.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of associative recall performance, including: learning rate sensitivity testing, scaling studies (width vs depth), inspection of 1-layer transformer training dynamics, and architectural ablations comparing Transformer and Mamba models.

Result: Recurrent models show critical sensitivity to learning rate choices, transformers and recurrent models benefit differently from width vs depth scaling (attention fails AR with single layer), and 1-layer transformers surprisingly exhibit induction head formation dynamics despite poor performance.

Conclusion: Training stability and optimization issues significantly impact recurrent model performance, architectural differences lead to contrasting scaling behaviors, and further research is needed to stabilize training of modern recurrent models.

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

*Vemula Sreenath,Filippo Gatti,Pierre Jehel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transparent ML architecture with HazBinLoss function addresses black-box limitations and data imbalance in ground motion prediction models, providing interpretable results while maintaining performance comparable to established methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning approaches for ground motion models operate as black boxes that are hard to interpret and trust, limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, earthquake databases suffer from significant data imbalances with fewer critical near-field records compared to abundant far-field records.

Method: Developed a transparent ML architecture where each input (magnitude, distance, interaction terms) is processed separately and added linearly to obtain output, showing exact contribution of each term. Used HazBinLoss function that assigns higher weights to critical near-field large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller magnitude records during training.

Result: The model captures known seismological principles and achieves comparable performance with established ground motion models while maintaining transparency. It prevents underprediction of the most damaging earthquake scenarios.

Conclusion: This transparent framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches for seismic risk assessment and disaster planning by providing interpretable and trustworthy predictions for critical decision-making.

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs can extrapolate beyond training data to generate numerical schemes, rediscovering first-order finite volume schemes and even discovering second-order schemes through symbolic regression and unsupervised PINN-like training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that GNNs can go beyond traditional approximation roles and actively contribute to developing novel numerical methods by generating numerical schemes, particularly showing extrapolation capabilities beyond training domains.

Method: Train GNNs on minimal datasets (two-node graphs) and use symbolic regression to analyze learned schemes. Employ unsupervised Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) loss without ground-truth data. Extend to higher-order schemes using 2-hop and 2-layer GNN architectures.

Result: GNNs successfully extrapolate first-order Finite Volume schemes for heat equation on unstructured meshes. Symbolic regression confirms rediscovery of exact analytical formulation. Unsupervised training recovers first-order scheme. Higher-order GNNs discover second-order correction terms and classic midpoint scheme.

Conclusion: GNNs are not just approximators but active contributors to numerical method development, capable of rediscovering and even discovering numerical schemes through minimal training and symbolic analysis, opening new paradigms in scientific computing.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient federated unlearning framework using Hessian information to selectively reset parameters sensitive to forgotten data, achieving strong privacy and high performance without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations require data erasure from deep learning models, which is challenging in Federated Learning where data remains on clients and full retraining is often infeasible.

Method: Uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. Model-agnostic approach without requiring server access to raw client data.

Result: Achieves strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy â 0.9 against re-trained benchmarks). Effectively neutralizes targeted backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for efficient data forgetting in Federated Learning that balances privacy protection with model performance.

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Motivation: Graph Neural Networks suffer from performance limitations due to graph topology issues like oversquashing and oversmoothing, which graph rewiring aims to mitigate by modifying graph structure.

Method: TRIGON constructs non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views, jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance.

Result: TRIGON produces rewired graphs with improved structural properties (reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, lower effective resistance) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on node classification tasks across homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Conclusion: The TRIGON framework effectively addresses GNN limitations through intelligent graph rewiring via learned triangle selection, demonstrating superior performance on various graph learning benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APT-LLM is a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLM quantization that achieves significant speedups over FP16 baselines and NVIDIA CUTLASS through novel data formats, matrix multiplication methods, memory management, and kernel optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have enormous computational demands that limit deployment and real-time performance. Existing quantization methods face challenges with GPU Tensor Core support, inefficient memory management, and inflexible kernel optimizations for ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs at arbitrary precision.

Method: Proposes APT-LLM with: 1) bipolar-INT data format for efficient conversion and parallel computation, 2) bit-level matrix multiplication method for arbitrary precision and Tensor Core optimization, 3) memory management system using shared memory for data recovery, and 4) dynamic kernel mapping for optimal hyperparameters across different matrix sizes.

Result: Achieves up to 3.99Ã speedup vs FP16 baselines and 2.16Ã speedup over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800, achieves up to 2.44Ã speedup over FP16 and 1.65Ã speedup over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Conclusion: APT-LLM provides an effective solution for accelerating arbitrary precision LLM inference by addressing GPU limitations through comprehensive optimization of data formats, computation methods, memory management, and kernel configuration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

*Shervin Khalafi,Ignacio Hounie,Dongsheng Ding,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A constrained optimization framework for diffusion models that unifies alignment and composition while enforcing reward constraints and proximity to pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving diffusion model outputs (alignment and composition) cannot guarantee faithful generation of samples with all desired properties when optimizing for multiple competing rewards or combining multiple models.

Method: Proposes a constrained optimization framework with theoretical characterization of solutions and develops a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions.

Result: Empirical demonstrations in image generation show the approach effectively satisfies constraints and improves on equally-weighted approaches for both alignment and composition tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the gap in existing methods by providing theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms for constrained alignment and composition of diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

TL;DR: Novel framework combining probabilistic crowd modeling and active learning for preference-based RL, handling noisy multi-annotator feedback and prioritizing informative actions for faster learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high cost and low availability of reliable human feedback in preference-based RL, especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly.

Method: Extend Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers with online reliability estimation, incorporate entropy-based query selection for active learning, and use probabilistic crowd modeling for noisy feedback.

Result: Agents trained with feedback on uncertain trajectories show faster learning in most tasks, outperform baselines in blood glucose control task using UVA/Padova simulator.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles noisy multi-annotator feedback and prioritizes informative queries, demonstrating improved learning efficiency in both synthetic and real-world-inspired environments.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

*Robin ThÃ©riault,Daniele Tantari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes dense associative memory (DAM) models using statistical mechanics, derives saddle-point equations for training stability, proposes a novel regularization scheme, and develops a network-growing algorithm to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAM models have gained attention for their robustness to adversarial examples and connections to transformers and diffusion models, but training stability and computational efficiency remain challenges.

Method: Statistical mechanics analysis of three-layer Boltzmann machines with Potts hidden units, derivation of saddle-point equations for stationary points, development of novel regularization scheme, and implementation of network-growing algorithm based on saddle-point hierarchy.

Result: The proposed regularization makes training significantly more stable, DAM learns interpretable solutions for supervised/unsupervised classification, and the network-growing algorithm drastically reduces computational costs by leveraging saddle-point hierarchy.

Conclusion: The statistical mechanics approach provides theoretical insights into DAM training dynamics, enabling stable training and efficient network growth while maintaining interpretable solutions for classification tasks.

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robustness assessment methods suffer from significant trade-offs between computational cost and measurement precision, limiting practical utility in safety-critical applications.

Method: Conducts comprehensive comparative analysis of existing robustness definitions and methodologies, then proposes tower robustness - a hypothesis testing-based metric for quantitative probabilistic robustness evaluation.

Result: Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates advantages and applicability of the proposed approach, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment assessments.

Conclusion: The tower robustness metric advances systematic understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep learning applications by providing a practical, efficient assessment method.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

*Jingyao Wu,Matthew Barthet,David Melhart,Georgios N. Yannakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel ambiguity-aware ordinal emotion representations that capture both annotation ambiguity and temporal dynamics through modeling emotion ambiguity via rate of change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore emotion ambiguity or treat it as static and independent over time, failing to capture the inherent ambiguity and dynamic nature of emotions.

Method: Proposed ambiguity-aware ordinal emotion representations that model emotion ambiguity through its rate of change. Evaluated on RECOLA and GameVibe corpora with both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous emotion traces.

Result: Ordinal representations outperformed conventional ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels with highest CCC and SDA scores. For bounded traces, they excelled in SDA, demonstrating superior ability to capture relative changes in emotion traces.

Conclusion: The proposed ordinal framework effectively captures both emotion annotation ambiguity and temporal dynamics, showing particular strength in modeling relative changes and dynamics of emotional traces across different types of emotion labels.

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

TL;DR: First formal proof that Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) expands LLM capabilities by breaking pure-text limitations through tools like Python interpreters, with new ASPO algorithm improving tool usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs with tools show promise, there's been no principled theory explaining why this paradigm is effective. The work aims to provide the first formal proof that TIR fundamentally expands LLM capabilities.

Method: Introduces Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO) to guide model behavior without compromising training stability. Uses comprehensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks with Python interpreter as external tool.

Result: TIR model decisively outperforms pure-text counterpart on pass@k metric, with advantages extending beyond computational problems to abstract insight tasks. Shows improved tool usage with early code invocation and more interactive turns.

Conclusion: Provides first principled explanation for TIR's success, demonstrating how tools enable strict expansion of model capabilities and unlock problem-solving strategies impossible for pure-text models.

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token Order Prediction (TOP) is proposed as a better auxiliary objective than Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) for language model training, using a learning-to-rank loss to order upcoming tokens by proximity instead of exact prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Token Prediction shows inconsistent improvements and underperforms in standard NLP benchmarks because exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.

Method: Propose Token Order Prediction (TOP) which trains models to order upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. Requires only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple transformer layers. Pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives.

Result: Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale.

Conclusion: Token Order Prediction is a more effective auxiliary objective than Multi-Token Prediction for language model training, providing better performance with simpler architecture requirements.

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to

TL;DR: EMind is a foundation model for electromagnetic signals that addresses challenges of signal heterogeneity, noise, and task diversity through large-scale pretraining on a unified dataset with specialized packing and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electromagnetic signals differ significantly from text/images with high heterogeneity, strong noise, and complex time-frequency structures, preventing direct use of existing general models. Current methods lack cross-task generalization and suffer from scarce high-quality datasets.

Method: Built the first unified standardized electromagnetic signal dataset covering multiple signal types and tasks. Developed length-adaptive multi-signal packing method and hardware-aware training strategy that leverage physical properties of electromagnetic signals for efficient representation learning.

Result: EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across many downstream tasks, successfully transitioning from task-specific models to a unified framework for electromagnetic intelligence.

Conclusion: The EMind foundation model effectively bridges large-scale pretraining with the unique nature of electromagnetic signals, providing a unified solution for electromagnetic communication and sensing tasks with demonstrated cross-task generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

TL;DR: DTSAM-EAC framework combines blockchain and federated learning for secure UAV networks, achieving 94% trust accuracy and 96% rogue detection with energy-efficient consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV-based Non-Terrestrial Networks are vulnerable to security attacks due to their distributed and dynamic nature, requiring adaptive trust mechanisms to detect rogue nodes.

Method: Integrates permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with Federated Learning for privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Uses dynamic trust scoring with weighted aggregation of past trust, present behavior, and energy contribution. Implements energy-aware consensus that prioritizes UAVs with higher available energy for block validation.

Result: Achieves 94% trust score prediction accuracy and 96% rogue UAV detection rate. Outperforms centralized and static baselines in privacy, energy efficiency, and reliability.

Conclusion: The framework provides an energy-efficient and scalable solution that meets 6G requirements for distributed intelligence and sustainability, effectively securing Non-Terrestrial Networks.

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as
base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their
distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In
this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware
Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The
proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with
Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust
ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust,
present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to
changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes
UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use
of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with
trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model.
Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score
prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming
centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy
efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of
distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and
scalable solution to secure NTNs.

*Vivek Kumar,Himanshu Sahu,Hari Prabhat Gupta,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This vision paper examines Yoga personalization challenges and proposes a multidisciplinary computing approach to help individuals discover, follow, and adapt yoga practices based on their unique needs and changing conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Yoga offers numerous benefits but requires personalization to individual needs, abilities, and changing circumstances. Current approaches lack systematic support for discovering appropriate practices, maintaining engagement, and adapting to changing conditions.

Method: The paper presents a preliminary approach using multidisciplinary computing techniques, including pose sensing and recommendation systems. It uses Surya Namaskar (12 choreographed poses) as a case study to illustrate the personalization challenges and potential solutions.

Result: This is the first comprehensive examination of decision support issues in Yoga personalization, covering from pose sensing to recommending corrections for complete regimens.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for solving Yoga personalization challenges through existing and novel computing techniques, highlighting the need for personalized recommendation systems that can adapt to individual needs and changing conditions over time.

Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and
meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced
worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are
a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or
breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits
of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover
their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies,
(b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities
and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items
based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this
vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem.
Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an
outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques
from a multidisciplinary computing perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first paper that comprehensively examines decision support issues
around Yoga personalization, from pose sensing to recommendation of corrections
for a complete regimen, and illustrates with a case study of Surya Namaskar --
a set of 12 choreographed poses.

### [261] [Does Calibration Affect Human Actions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18317)
*Meir Nizri,Amos Azaria,Chirag Gupta,Noam Hazon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Calibration alone doesn't sufficiently improve human decision-making with ML classifiers; prospect theory corrections are crucial for better alignment between model predictions and human decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how calibrating classification models affects non-expert human decision-making, trust in models, and whether additional behavioral economics corrections can improve human-model interaction.

Method: Conducted HCI experiments to measure effects of calibration on trust and decision correlation, then applied prospect theory corrections from behavioral economics and tested their impact.

Result: Calibration alone was insufficient - prospect theory correction was crucial for increasing correlation between human decisions and model predictions. While correlation improved, direct trust questions showed no difference between methods.

Conclusion: Model calibration needs to be complemented with behavioral economics insights (prospect theory) to effectively improve human decision-making alignment with ML predictions, though this doesn't necessarily translate to increased perceived trust.

Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and
adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this
proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made
by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a
Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of
calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between
decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported
calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from
behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and
decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the
prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between
human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation
suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model
more?" are unaffected by the method used.

TL;DR: Evaluation of target transparency and tool visualization modes in HoloLens 2 OST-AR systems shows opaque targets and real tool occlusion yield best depth perception and usability for arm's distance surgical guidance tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical see-through AR systems like HoloLens 2 have potential for surgical guidance but face challenges with depth perception of holograms and occlusion of real instruments, requiring evaluation of different visualization approaches.

Method: Two experiments with 10 participants on HoloLens 2: (1) depth matching task comparing high vs low transparency targets, (2) simulated surgical pinpoint task with 6 conditions (2 transparencies Ã 3 tool modes: virtual hologram, real tool, no tracking). Measured depth error, localization error, usability, workload, and qualitative feedback.

Result: Opaque targets significantly reduce depth estimation error compared to transparent targets. Real tool occlusion provided highest accuracy and usability with lowest workload, while no tool tracking performed worst. High transparency with real tool visibility slightly impaired depth cues without improving usability.

Conclusion: Correct occlusion cues with opaque virtual content occluded by real tools in real-time are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion handling; use transparency cautiously if occlusion unavailable.

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

### [263] [Beyond prior knowledge: The predictive role of knowledge-building in Tutor Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18545)
*Tasmia Shahriar,Mia Ameen,Aditi Mallavarapu,Shiyan Jiang,Noboru Matsuda*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Knowledge-building activities mediate the bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning, with teachable agents helping students shift from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building behaviors for better learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often default to knowledge-telling behaviors instead of knowledge-building when teaching, limiting their learning. Teachable agents with persistent questioning can encourage this shift, but the mediating role of knowledge-building in the procedural-conceptual knowledge relationship needs investigation.

Method: The study examined the bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual knowledge, analyzing how knowledge-building activities mediated this relationship. Students interacted with teachable agents that posed follow-up questions to encourage knowledge-building.

Result: Found a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual knowledge. Students who engaged in knowledge-building showed higher post-test scores regardless of their pre-test performance, indicating knowledge-building bridges the gap for students with low prior knowledge.

Conclusion: Knowledge-building serves as a crucial mechanism that mediates the bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning, particularly benefiting students with low prior knowledge by enhancing both types of knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: When adopting the role of a teacher in learning-by-teaching environments,
students often struggle to engage in knowledge-building activities, such as
providing explanations and addressing misconceptions. Instead, they frequently
default to knowledge-telling behaviors, where they simply dictate what they
already know or what to do without deeper reflection, thereby limiting
learning. Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent
follow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift
from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor
learning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and
procedural knowledge. Research has established a bidirectional relationship
between these knowledge types, where improvements in one reinforce the other.
This study investigates the role of knowledge-building in mediating the
bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning. Our
findings revealed a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and
conceptual knowledge, with higher post-test scores observed among students who
engaged in knowledge-building, regardless of their procedural and conceptual
pre-test performance. This suggests that knowledge-building serves as a crucial
mechanism bridging the gap between students with low prior knowledge and higher
conceptual and procedural learning gain.

*Hiroto Sakimura,Takayuki Nagaya,Tomoki Nishi,Tetsuo Kurahashi,Katsunori Kohda,Nobuhiko Muramoto*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Long-term study shows physiological-arousal relationships change over months, requiring periodic model updates for emotion estimation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that physiological features maintain stable relationships with subjective emotional states over long timeframes, which is rarely examined despite being fundamental to affective computing.

Method: Collected longitudinal physiological data (blood volume pulse, EDA, skin temperature, acceleration) and self-reported emotional states from 24 participants over two three-month periods in naturalistic working environments, using Explainable Boosting Machines for interpretable analysis.

Result: Model trained on first-period data showed 5% accuracy decrease when tested on second-period data. Heart rate remained relatively stable predictor while minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level fluctuations between periods.

Conclusion: Physiological-arousal relationships exhibit temporal variability, suggesting emotion estimation models should be periodically updated (e.g., every five months) based on observed shift trends to maintain performance over time.

Abstract: Estimating emotional states from physiological signals is a central topic in
affective computing and psychophysiology. While many emotion estimation systems
implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and
subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes.
This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across
several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and
constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals --
including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature,
and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24
participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic
working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between
physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined
how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable
Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on
1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period
data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations.
EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a
relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level
fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited,
these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in
physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models
should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed
shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM interfaces follow rigid, linear interaction paradigms that limit their versatile capabilities, requiring more innovative and user-centered approaches.

Method: Design thinking workshop with participants identifying use cases, evaluating current interfaces, and creating visualizations of new interaction concepts. Human-centered design process with iterative refinement through user feedback.

Result: Participant-generated ideas advanced a whiteboard-based UI approach with concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic conversation branching, and enhanced user control mechanisms.

Conclusion: Future LLM interface development should prioritize UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles, with continuous refinement through iterative feedback processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models have become widely adopted tools due to their versatile
capabilities, yet their user interfaces remain limited, often following rigid,
linear interaction paradigms. In this paper, we present insights from a design
thinking workshop held at the deRSE25 conference aiming at collaboratively
developing innovative user interface concepts for LLMs. During the workshop,
participants identified common use cases, evaluated the strengths and
shortcomings of current LLM interfaces, and created visualizations of new
interaction concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic
conversation branching, and enhanced mechanisms for user control. We describe
how these participant-generated ideas advanced our own whiteboard-based UI
approach. The ongoing development of this interface is guided by the
human-centered design process - an iterative, user-focused methodology that
emphasizes continuous refinement through user feedback. Broader implications
for future LLM interface development are discussed, advocating for increased
attention to UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles.

TL;DR: scI2CL is a novel single-cell multi-omics fusion framework using intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning to learn comprehensive cellular representations for various downstream tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell multi-omics data contain valuable cellular state information, but modeling continuous cell differentiation processes and inferring cell interaction patterns remains computationally challenging.

Method: scI2CL uses intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning to learn comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary multi-omics data.

Result: Outperforms 8 state-of-the-art methods on 4 datasets in cell clustering, discovers latent monocyte subpopulations, correctly constructs developmental trajectories, and resolves CD4+ T cell misclassification issues.

Conclusion: scI2CL accurately characterizes cross-omics relationships, effectively fuses multi-omics data, and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various downstream analysis tasks.

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and
analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity,
diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \&
development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to
computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell
multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics
fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn
comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary
multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over
existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight
state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell
subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell
subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously,
scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental
trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In
addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two
subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely
distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize
cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data
and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various

### [268] [Controllable Single-shot Animation Blending with Temporal Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18525)
*Eleni Tselepi,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: First single-shot motion blending framework that enables seamless blending of skeletal motions by temporally conditioning generation with skeleton-aware normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-shot motion generation methods lack explicit controllable framework for blending multiple motions within a single generative pass, limiting animators' ability to create variations.

Method: Introduces skeleton-aware normalization mechanism to guide transitions between motions, enabling smooth data-driven control over when and how motions blend through temporal conditioning.

Result: Extensive evaluations across various animation styles and kinematic skeletons show the approach produces plausible, smooth, and controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables seamless motion blending in single-shot generation, providing animators with controllable variation creation without additional data or extensive retraining.

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

### [269] [SemLayoutDiff: Semantic Layout Generation with Diffusion Model for Indoor Scene Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18597)
*Xiaohao Sun,Divyam Goel,Angle X. Chang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SemLayoutDiff is a unified diffusion model that generates diverse 3D indoor scenes by first creating semantic layouts and then placing furniture while respecting architectural constraints like doors and windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods cannot condition scene synthesis on architectural constraints, limiting their ability to produce practical and unobstructed furniture arrangements in realistic indoor environments.

Method: Uses a categorical diffusion model to generate coherent semantic maps conditioned on room masks, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout and architectural elements.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on the 3D-FRONT dataset, producing spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes with practical furniture arrangements.

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff provides an effective unified approach for diverse 3D indoor scene synthesis that explicitly accounts for architectural constraints, resulting in more practical and realistic scene generation.

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

### [270] [PanoHair: Detailed Hair Strand Synthesis on Volumetric Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18944)
*Shashikant Verma,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PanoHair is a generative model that quickly produces high-fidelity 3D hair strands from single images, eliminating the need for complex multi-view setups and reducing generation time to under 5 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hair synthesis methods require complex multi-view studio setups and have slow processing times, making realistic hair strand generation inefficient and inaccessible.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model to estimate head geometry as signed distance fields, predicts semantic segmentation masks and 3D orientations for hair regions, and employs latent space manipulation for diverse hairstyle generation.

Result: Generates clean manifold hair meshes in under 5 seconds with semantic and orientation maps, significantly outperforming existing methods in speed and visual quality.

Conclusion: PanoHair provides an efficient, generative solution for high-fidelity hair strand synthesis that eliminates complex acquisition setups and enables rapid, diverse hairstyle generation from single images.

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

*Florian Hahlbohm,Linus Franke,Leon OverkÃ¤mping,Paula Wespe,Susana Castillo,Martin Eisemann,Marcus Magnor*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Optimizations for Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) representation that achieve faster training (25%), faster rendering (2x), reduced VRAM usage (20%), and slight quality improvements without sacrificing visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INPC combines neural fields with point-based rendering for high-quality novel view synthesis, but suffers from slow rendering speeds that limit practical usability.

Method: Improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, pre-training for CNN hole-filling network, and modeling points as small Gaussians during inference for better extrapolated views.

Result: Achieved 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, 20% reduced VRAM usage, and slight image quality improvements while maintaining visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed optimizations significantly enhance INPC's performance and practicality while maintaining or improving quality, with implementations designed to be broadly applicable beyond INPC.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

*Jakub MichaÅkÃ³w*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: Deep neural networks (CNN and LSTM) effectively forecast financial return distributions using custom loss functions, outperforming traditional GARCH models in probabilistic forecasting and risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more accurate probabilistic forecasting methods for financial returns that can capture complex distributional characteristics like heavy tails and asymmetry, providing better risk assessment tools.

Method: Used 1D CNN and LSTM architectures to forecast parameters of Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t distributions with custom negative log-likelihood loss functions. Tested on six major equity indices using probabilistic evaluation metrics (LPS, CRPS, PIT).

Result: Deep learning models provided accurate distributional forecasts and performed competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performed best across multiple evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks are viable alternatives to traditional econometric models for financial risk assessment and portfolio management, particularly when capturing heavy tails and asymmetry in returns.

Abstract: This study evaluates deep neural networks for forecasting probability
distributions of financial returns. 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures are used to forecast parameters of
three probability distributions: Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t.
Using custom negative log-likelihood loss functions, distribution parameters
are optimized directly. The models are tested on six major equity indices (S\&P
500, BOVESPA, DAX, WIG, Nikkei 225, and KOSPI) using probabilistic evaluation
metrics including Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability
Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT). Results show that deep
learning models provide accurate distributional forecasts and perform
competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. The
LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performs best across multiple
evaluation criteria, capturing both heavy tails and asymmetry in financial
returns. This work shows that deep neural networks are viable alternatives to
traditional econometric models for financial risk assessment and portfolio
management.

*Mauricio Manhaes,Christine Miller,Nicholas Schroeder*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of "Quasi-Creature" - AI that simulates intelligence without genuine understanding, causing user frustration through the "Uncanny Valley of Agency" where high agency meets erratic reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the paradoxical user experience with generative AI where superhuman fluency coexists with absurd failures, causing potent frustration that stems from ontological issues of simulated intelligence without embodiment.

Method: Mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) examining collaborative creative tasks, analyzing the relationship between perceived AI efficiency and user frustration.

Result: Found a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user frustration, demonstrating that erratic reliability in highly agentic AI causes cognitive dissonance and negative experiences.

Conclusion: The Uncanny Valley of Agency framework robustly explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications for design, ethics, and societal integration of these technologies.

Abstract: The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman
fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper
argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem,
stemming from the "Quasi-Creature"-an entity simulating intelligence without
embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates
the "Uncanny Valley of Agency," a framework where user comfort drops when
highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as
cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI,
cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the
Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative
mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals
a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user
frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly
explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications
for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien
technologies.

*Zekun Ni,Jonathan Weyn,Hang Zhang,Yanfei Xiang,Jiang Bian,Weixin Jin,Kit Thambiratnam,Qi Zhang,Haiyu Dong,Hongyu Sun*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: Huracan is the first end-to-end observation-driven weather forecasting system that combines ensemble data assimilation with forecasting, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art NWP systems while using only observational data inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning weather models still rely on NWP initial conditions, limiting their forecast potential. End-to-end systems haven't matched NWP performance yet.

Method: Combines ensemble data assimilation model with forecast model to create complete end-to-end system using only observations as inputs

Result: Matches or exceeds ECMWF ENS continuous ranked probability score on 75.4% of variable and lead time combinations, despite using less observation data

Conclusion: Major advancement in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction that opens opportunities for revolutionizing operational forecasting

Abstract: Over the past few years, machine learning-based data-driven weather
prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing
more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared
to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still
rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast
abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet
to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work,
we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which
combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce
highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is
not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end
ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an
accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP
competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data.
Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of
ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a
major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up
opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather
forecasting.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Reduction from (1+Îµ)-approximate Earth Mover's Distance to (1+Îµ)-approximate Closest Pair, improving algorithm runtime from nÂ²â»Î©(ÎµÂ²) to nÂ²â»Î©Ì(ÎµÂ¹áÂ³)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop faster approximation algorithms for high-dimensional Earth Mover's Distance by leveraging advances in Closest Pair algorithms

Method: Sublinear implementation of Multiplicative Weights Update framework for EMD, performing updates implicitly without computing/storing weights by exploiting geometric structure

Result: Obtained (1+Îµ)-approximation algorithm for EMD running in time nÂ²â»Î©Ì(ÎµÂ¹áÂ³), improving over prior nÂ²â»Î©(ÎµÂ²) runtime

Conclusion: Successfully reduced EMD approximation to CP approximation, achieving faster runtime through innovative sublinear MWU implementation

Abstract: We give a reduction from $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) to $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Closest Pair (CP). As a consequence, we
improve the fastest known approximation algorithm for high-dimensional EMD.
Here, given $p\in [1, 2]$ and two sets of $n$ points $X,Y \subseteq (\mathbb
R^d,\ell_p)$, their EMD is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between $X$
and $Y$, where the cost of matching two vectors is their $\ell_p$ distance.
Further, CP is the basic problem of finding a pair of points realizing $\min_{x
\in X, y\in Y} ||x-y||_p$. Our contribution is twofold: we show that if a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate CP can be computed in time $n^{2-\phi}$, then a
$1+O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to EMD can be computed in time
$n^{2-\Omega(\phi)}$; plugging in the fastest known algorithm for CP [Alman,
Chan, Williams FOCS'16], we obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for EMD running in time $n^{2-\tilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^{1/3})}$ for
high-dimensional point sets, which improves over the prior fastest running time
of $n^{2-\Omega(\varepsilon^2)}$ [Andoni, Zhang FOCS'23]. Our main technical
contribution is a sublinear implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update
framework for EMD. Specifically, we demonstrate that the updates can be
executed without ever explicitly computing or storing the weights; instead, we
exploit the underlying geometric structure to perform the updates implicitly.

*Shanyan Lai*

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: This paper applies various RNN attention mechanisms (additive, Luong's, self-attention, sparse attention) to asset pricing for 420 large-cap US stocks, addressing temporal dependency and future data leakage issues while testing model stability across different market conditions including COVID-19.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional ML-based asset pricing that mis-capture temporal dependency and short memory, and to address future data leaking issues ignored by advanced attention-based models like Transformers.

Method: Pretrained RNN attention models with multiple attention mechanisms (additive, Luong's three attentions, global self-attention, sliding window sparse attention) applied to top 420 large-cap US stocks, tested across three periods including pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID market conditions.

Result: Self-attention and sparse attention models showed strong performance in value-weighted portfolio backtesting, achieving annualized Sortino ratios of 2.0 and 1.80 respectively during COVID-19 period. Sparse attention performed more stably across different market capitalization sizes.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms, particularly self-attention and sparse attention, demonstrate great capabilities in asset pricing for deriving absolute returns and hedging downside risks, with sparse attention showing more stable performance across different market conditions.

Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the
mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three
attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse
attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420
large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale
state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing
context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML)
based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short
memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address
the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based
models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also
consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and
mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model
structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research.
All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild
uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year
post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the
stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that
in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att
exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging
downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80
respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more
stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns
with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Federated learning framework for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using DWI sequences, achieving better performance than centralized approaches while maintaining privacy across 14 healthcare centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics, scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Current computational approaches lack generalization across institutions and many centers lack sufficient labeled data for training.

Method: Developed a collaborative federated learning framework (FedAvg) using deep center-independent representations from 14 healthcare centers with 2031 studies, enabling knowledge sharing without direct data exchange.

Result: FedAvg achieved DSC of 0.71Â±0.24, AVD of 5.29Â±22.74, ALD of 2.16Â±3.60 and LF1 of 0.70Â±0.26, outperforming centralized and other federated approaches. Showed strong generalization with DSC of 0.64Â±0.29 on out-of-distribution centers without additional training.

Conclusion: The federated learning framework successfully addresses the variability in stroke lesion analysis across different healthcare centers, providing robust segmentation performance while preserving data privacy and demonstrating excellent generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

TL;DR: Novel weakly-supervised macular edema segmentation method using retinal layer guidance and test-time adaptation to bridge performance gap with fully-supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert-annotated pixel-level datasets for macular edema analysis are expensive to collect, and current weakly-supervised methods underperform compared to fully-supervised approaches.

Method: Leverages correlation between edema area and retinal layers in SD-OCT images, incorporating layer-structure-guided post-processing and test-time adaptation strategy into an adversarial framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show improved accuracy and robustness in edema area segmentation, narrowing the performance gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances weakly-supervised edema segmentation by incorporating retinal layer information and test-time adaptation, making it more practical for clinical applications where expert annotations are scarce.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

### [282] [Understanding Benefits and Pitfalls of Current Methods for the Segmentation of Undersampled MRI Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18975)
*Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Matthias Hein,Christian F. Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first unified benchmark comparing 7 approaches for segmenting undersampled MRI data, finding that simple two-stage methods with data-consistency outperform complex specialized one-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisition is time-consuming and costly. While accelerated MRI methods exist, there's growing interest in performing segmentation directly on accelerated data rather than perfect reconstruction. However, no comprehensive comparison of these methods exists.

Method: The paper benchmarks 7 approaches for segmenting undersampled MRI data, comparing one-stage (combined reconstruction+segmentation) vs two-stage (reconstruction followed by segmentation) methods using two MRI datasets with multi-coil k-space data and human-annotated segmentation ground-truth.

Result: Simple two-stage methods that incorporate data-consistency achieved the best segmentation scores, outperforming more complex specialized methods developed specifically for this task.

Conclusion: For segmenting accelerated MRI data, straightforward two-stage approaches that maintain data-consistency are more effective than complex one-stage methods, providing practical guidance for clinical applications.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

### [283] [RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154)
*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM is an end-to-end diffusion model that directly restores photo-realistic images from sensor RAW data, bypassing traditional ISP pipelines and achieving superior fidelity compared to sRGB-domain methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sRGB-domain diffusion models face a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation due to processing lossy sRGB inputs and ignoring the availability of RAW data in edge devices, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) for optimal latent representations, differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) for joint RAW-sRGB optimization, scalable degradation pipeline for dataset synthesis, and configurable multi-bayer LoRA module for diverse RAW patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments show RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, producing higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: RDDM effectively addresses out-of-distribution issues in RAW domain adaptation and provides an end-to-end solution for direct RAW image restoration, outperforming conventional two-stage approaches.

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

*Aneesh Rangnekar,Harini Veeraraghavan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RF-Deep uses random forest classifier with deep features from pretrained transformer to detect out-of-distribution CT scans and improve cancer segmentation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models degrade when applied to out-of-distribution CT datasets, requiring a solution to enhance segmentation reliability across different data distributions.

Method: Uses random forest classifier with deep features from Swin Transformer encoder pretrained with masked image modeling on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans, combined with convolution decoder trained on 317 lung cancer scans.

Result: Achieved FPR95 of 18.26% on PE, 27.66% on COVID-19, and <0.1% on abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD detection methods.

Conclusion: RF-Deep provides a simple and effective approach to enhance cancer segmentation reliability in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

*Soumen Ghosh,Christine Jestin Hannan,Rajat Vashistha,Parveen Kundu,Sandra Brosda,Lauren G. Aoude,James Lonie,Andrew Nathanson,Jessica Ng,Andrew P. Barbour,Viktor Vegh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Cross-cancer evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT shows dataset diversity (multi-demographic, multi-center, multi-cancer) is more important than model complexity for robust tumor segmentation generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows where anatomical sites, scanners, and patient populations vary widely.

Method: Trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms: target only (oesophageal cancer), public only (AutoPET dataset), and combined training using two novel expert-annotated whole-body datasets (279 oesophageal cancer patients from Australia, 54 lung cancer patients from India).

Result: Combined training approach provided most balanced results (mean DSC: lung 52.9, oesophageal 40.7, AutoPET 60.9), reducing boundary errors and improving robustness across all cohorts. Target-only model showed severe overfitting (DSC <3.4 on external cohort), while public-only model underperformed on oesophageal cohort (DSC 26.7).

Conclusion: Dataset diversity, particularly multi-demographic, multi-center and multi-cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust generalization for clinically robust segmentation.

Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor
segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners,
and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer
evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated
whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort)
and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public
AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain
performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms.
Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For
the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain
accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC
less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model
generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung
cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).
The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung
(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and
improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that
dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi
cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust
generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep
learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than
model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

*Eichi Takaya,Ryusei Inamori*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ModAn-MulSupCon uses modality and anatomy metadata as multi-label targets for contrastive pretraining, achieving superior performance on medical image classification tasks when fine-tuned, but SimCLR/ImageNet work better for frozen encoder scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert annotations are scarce for large-scale supervised pretraining in medical imaging, while metadata like modality and anatomical region are widely available but underutilized. The paper aims to leverage this ubiquitous metadata to learn transferable representations.

Method: Encodes each image's modality and anatomy as multi-hot vectors, uses ResNet-18 encoder pretrained on miniRIN dataset with Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss, evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary classification tasks.

Result: ModAn-MulSupCon achieved best AUC on knee MRI ACL tear (0.964) and thyroid nodule malignancy (0.763), second best on breast lesion malignancy (0.926). SimCLR/ImageNet performed better with frozen encoder, showing ModAn-MulSupCon benefits more from task adaptation.

Conclusion: Encoding modality/anatomy metadata as multi-label targets provides practical, scalable pretraining that improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is possible. Strong initialization for label-scarce settings, but SimCLR/ImageNet better for frozen encoder deployments.

Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised
pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical
region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and
anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that
leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.
  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector.
A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN,
16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss,
and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary
classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast
ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).
  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL
(0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked
second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the
encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon
representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear
separability.
  Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as
multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that
improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a
strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas
SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper reflects on applying declarative 5th generation languages (5GL) for imaging system design, using a 96-camera multi-modal imager case study to demonstrate how domain requirements can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration across optical, algorithmic, hardware, and life sciences teams by using declarative problem formulation to preserve mission-critical input from diverse stakeholders and minimize costly misalignment.

Method: The author uses the 96-Eyes project (96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for drug discovery) as a case study to illustrate how project requirements can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements using 5GL, with real-world code examples.

Result: The declarative approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes misalignment across interdisciplinary teams. However, practical barriers exist in adopting 5GL where imperative 3rd-generation languages remain the default.

Conclusion: Declarative problem formulations can facilitate innovation in concurrent R&D workflows, but programming paradigms implicitly shape research workflows through existing domain hierarchies, requiring further exploration of how to effectively implement 5GL in different organizational contexts.

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,
5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system
design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

TL;DR: This paper explores using quantum computing principles to generate fractal Julia sets, leveraging quantum superposition, randomness, and entanglement to create complex patterns for quantum generative art applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that both quantum systems and fractals exhibit complex, self-similar patterns. The authors aim to bridge quantum computing with fractal generation, particularly Julia sets, to explore new possibilities in quantum generative arts.

Method: The method involves building quantum circuits that utilize quantum mechanical principles - superposition, randomness, and entanglement - to generate and manipulate Julia set patterns. The approach couples quantum computing techniques with fractal image generation algorithms.

Result: The paper successfully outlines the generation of a Julia set dataset using quantum circuits, demonstrating that quantum computing principles can be effectively applied to create complex fractal patterns with unique quantum characteristics.

Conclusion: Quantum circuits show promising potential for fractal image generation, particularly Julia sets. This approach opens new research directions in quantum generative arts, enabling customized quantum-themed artistic landscapes and applications across various ecosystems.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum

TL;DR: The paper establishes that analog quantum simulators with global control fields can achieve universal quantum computation, introduces direct quantum optimal control for experimental implementation, and demonstrates practical applications including three-body interactions and topological dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether analog quantum simulators with global control fields can realize universal quantum dynamics and bridge the gap between theoretical possibility and experimental reality.

Method: Developed a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using global pulse control, extended to fermionic/bosonic systems, and introduced direct quantum optimal control technique to synthesize complex Hamiltonians while incorporating hardware constraints.

Result: Proved broad class of analog quantum simulators is universal, experimentally engineered three-body interactions outside blockade regime, demonstrated topological dynamics on Rydberg atom array, and achieved high-fidelity dynamics despite hardware limitations.

Conclusion: The work enables quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, allows engineering of effective multi-body interactions, and advances quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful
platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such
as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential
for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental
theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems
realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only
global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators
is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and
bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical
superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with
experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment
- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex
effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware
constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body
interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics
on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key
experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position
fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration
pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal
dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming
both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new
avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the
engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of
quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

TL;DR: Study examines privacy-utility tradeoff in healthcare data sharing, identifies vulnerable patient groups, and evaluates anonymization methods showing MO-OBAM provides best protection with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secondary use of healthcare data is crucial for research but raises privacy concerns, requiring balance between privacy preservation and data utility for both data providers and users.

Method: Used adult patient hospitalization data (2013-2015) to predict sepsis, identified vulnerable sub-populations, and evaluated three anonymization methods: k-anonymity, Zheng et al.'s technique, and MO-OBAM model.

Result: k-anonymity offered limited protection. Zheng et al.'s method and MO-OBAM provided stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding best utility outcomes - only 2% change in precision/recall compared to original data.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for responsible healthcare data sharing, highlighting need for anonymization methods that protect vulnerable populations without sacrificing ML model performance.

Abstract: The secondary use of healthcare data is vital for research and clinical
innovation, but it raises concerns about patient privacy. This study
investigates how to balance privacy preservation and data utility in healthcare
data sharing, considering the perspectives of both data providers and data
users. Using a dataset of adult patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2015, we
predict whether sepsis was present at admission or developed during the
hospital stay. We identify sub-populations, such as older adults, frequently
hospitalized patients, and racial minorities, that are especially vulnerable to
privacy attacks due to their unique combinations of demographic and healthcare
utilization attributes. These groups are also critical for machine learning
(ML) model performance. We evaluate three anonymization methods-$k$-anonymity,
the technique by Zheng et al., and the MO-OBAM model-based on their ability to
reduce re-identification risk while maintaining ML utility. Results show that
$k$-anonymity offers limited protection. The methods of Zheng et al. and
MO-OBAM provide stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding the best
utility outcomes: only a 2% change in precision and recall compared to the
original dataset. This work provides actionable insights for healthcare
organizations on how to share data responsibly. It highlights the need for
anonymization methods that protect vulnerable populations without sacrificing
the performance of data-driven models.

TL;DR: TRNO neural operator overcomes limitations of GRU/LSTM models for plasticity modeling, achieving resolution-independent predictions and 1000x speedup in multiscale simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network surrogates for plasticity suffer from long training times, poor extrapolation, time-resolution dependence, and limited ability to handle complex material behavior like temperature-dependent plastic anisotropy.

Method: Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO) architecture that is time-resolution-independent, applied to model temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium with strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity.

Result: TRNO achieves high predictive accuracy, generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases, temperatures, and time resolutions, and outperforms conventional GRU/LSTM models in both training efficiency and predictive performance.

Conclusion: The TRNO enables multiscale simulations with at least three orders of magnitude speedup over traditional constitutive models while maintaining accuracy for complex temperature-dependent plasticity problems.

Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational
mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often
rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from
long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate
poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity
handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a
time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the
temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which
shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high
predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases,
temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and
LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we
demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at
least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are
conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and
adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English
(AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44
peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine
Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we
identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand
ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation,
annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches
to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations
for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing,
our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that
foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory
accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent
interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer
implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to
address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

### [295] [EAI-Avatar: Emotion-Aware Interactive Talking Head Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18337)
*Haijie Yang,Zhenyu Zhang,Hao Tang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EAI-Avatar is an emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic conversations that uses LLMs and a novel transformer-based approach to create temporally consistent avatars with emotional variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking head generation methods focus on one-way animation and lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities for bidirectional conversational interactions, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Uses LLMs (like GPT-4) for dialogue generation, a Transformer-based head mask generator for consistent motion features, and an interactive talking tree structure with reverse-level traversal to extract historical emotional cues for expression synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in generating temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states.

Conclusion: EAI-Avatar effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling emotion-aware bidirectional conversational interactions with precise emotional adaptation and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head
generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely
on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional
conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities,
significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic
interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language
models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual
avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between
speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head
mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent
mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask
sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive
talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree
node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current
character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract
rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and
effectiveness of our method.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: INSIDE is a novel data expansion method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between existing speaker embeddings in a pretrained space, then generating corresponding speech waveforms to augment training data for speaker verification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale and diverse speaker identity data is expensive, challenging, and limited by privacy concerns, creating a need for alternative data expansion methods.

Method: Select pairs of nearby speaker embeddings from a pretrained embedding space, compute intermediate embeddings using spherical linear interpolation, feed these to a text-to-speech system to generate speech waveforms, and combine with original dataset for training.

Result: Models trained with INSIDE-expanded data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06% to 5.24% relative improvements in speaker verification and 13.44% relative improvement in gender classification.

Conclusion: INSIDE is an effective, flexible, and scalable data expansion method that can be combined with other augmentation techniques to improve speaker verification and related tasks without requiring additional real data collection.

Abstract: The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely
attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However,
collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often
limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE
(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion
method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between
existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker
embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate
embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings
are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech
waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train
downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded
data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\%
relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker
verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,
where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible
with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable
addition to existing training pipelines.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CTF-Dojo is a large-scale executable runtime environment with 658 CTF challenges for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments are scarce, limiting progress in training capable ML agents. Current approaches lack verifiable feedback loops for effective LLM training in software engineering tasks.

Method: Developed CTF-Dojo with 658 containerized CTF challenges and CTF-Forge automated pipeline to transform public artifacts into execution environments. Trained LLM agents on 486 execution-verified trajectories.

Result: Achieved up to 11.6% absolute gains over baselines across three benchmarks. Best 32B model reached 31.9% Pass@1, establishing new open-weight state-of-the-art rivaling frontier models.

Conclusion: Execution-grounded training signals are pivotal for advancing high-performance ML agents without costly proprietary systems, demonstrating effectiveness of CTF-style tasks as benchmark for executable-agent learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

### [298] [LaQual: A Novel Framework for Automated Evaluation of LLM App Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18636)
*Yan Wang,Xinyi Hou,Yanjie Zhao,Weiguo Lin,Haoyu Wang,Junjun Si*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LaQual is an automated framework for evaluating LLM app quality through hierarchical classification, static filtering, and dynamic scenario-adaptive evaluation, achieving high correlation with human judgments and significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM app store ranking methods rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, making it difficult for users to efficiently find high-quality applications.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Hierarchical labeling and classification of LLM apps, 2) Static filtering using time-weighted user engagement and functional metrics, 3) Dynamic scenario-adaptive evaluation where LLM generates scenario-specific metrics, scoring rules, and tasks.

Result: High consistency with human judgments (Spearman's rho 0.62-0.60), reduces candidate apps by 66.7-81.3%, outperforms baselines in decision confidence (5.45 vs 3.30) and evaluation report value (4.75 vs 2.25).

Conclusion: LaQual provides a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.

Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of
intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content
creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for
ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics
like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently
find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an
automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of
three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GitTaskBench is a benchmark with 54 realistic tasks across 7 domains to evaluate code agents' ability to work with real GitHub repositories, showing current systems solve only 48.15% of tasks due to environment setup and dependency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks don't evaluate code agents in authentic, workflow-driven scenarios using large-scale code repositories like GitHub, which is vital for real-world software development.

Method: Created GitTaskBench with 54 tasks across 7 modalities and domains, each pairing a repository with automated human-curated evaluation harness. Proposed alpha-value metric to quantify economic benefit of agent performance.

Result: Experiments with 3 state-of-the-art agent frameworks and multiple advanced LLMs show best-performing system (OpenHands+Claude 3.7) solves only 48.15% of tasks. Over half of failures due to environment setup and dependency resolution issues.

Conclusion: Leveraging code repositories for complex task solving remains challenging, highlighting need for robust workflow management and timeout preparedness. GitTaskBench aims to drive progress in repository-aware code reasoning and execution.

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at
https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.

*BarÄ±Å BayazÄ±t,Yao Li,Xujie Si*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: LLMs show promise in automated proof generation for verification tasks, with strengths in small proofs and context-aware generation, but performance varies across projects and includes some unexpected errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of large language models in automating proof generation for verification using proof assistants, as their potential in this domain remains unclear despite theoretical promise.

Method: Case study based on two mature Rocq projects (hs-to-coq tool and Verdi) using both quantitative and qualitative analysis to assess LLM proof generation capabilities.

Result: LLMs benefit significantly from external dependencies and context, perform well on small proofs but can handle large ones too, show varying performance across different verification projects, and can generate concise proofs while also making odd mistakes.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate promising capabilities for proof automation but their effectiveness is context-dependent and project-specific, with both impressive successes and unexpected limitations in proof generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can potentially help with verification using
proof assistants by automating proofs. However, it is unclear how effective
LLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two
mature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative
analysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the
same source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform
great on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform
differently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate
concise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but
can also make odd mistakes.

### [301] [Facilitating Matches on Allocation Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18325)
*Yohai Trabelsi,Abhijin Adiga,Yonatan Aumann,Sarit Kraus,S. S. Ravi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper presents algorithms for allocation platforms to optimize social good by strategically requesting agents to relax restrictions, while ensuring no agent is worse off and respecting budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve overall utility in allocation systems by encouraging agents to relax restrictions, while protecting individual agents from being harmed and working within facilitator budget limits.

Method: Formal problem definition with participation guarantees hierarchy, polynomial-time algorithms for one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings, and extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets.

Result: The paper demonstrates the benefits of facilitation and relaxation approaches, showing how different participation guarantees impact outcomes in allocation optimization problems.

Conclusion: Strategic relaxation of restrictions through algorithmic facilitation can significantly improve social good in allocation platforms while maintaining individual agent protections and respecting budget constraints.

Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an
allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator''
aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by
encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the
same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.
Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.
`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to
relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an
optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned
constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal
definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the
facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees
and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial
algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization
problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We
demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the
implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive
experimentation on three real-world datasets.

*Anders MÃ¸lmen HÃ¸st,Pierre Lison,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRIAGE is an automated LLM-based system that maps CVEs to ATT&CK techniques using a hybrid approach combining rule-based reasoning and in-context learning, improving efficiency and recall over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vulnerability databases like NVD lack information on real-world attack impact (TTPs), and manual CVE-to-TTP mapping is time-consuming due to high volume of new vulnerabilities.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Prompt LLM with MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology for initial technique predictions, 2) Combine with second LLM module using in-context learning for hybrid mapping.

Result: In-context learning outperforms individual methods, hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques, GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B.

Conclusion: LLMs can automatically predict cybersecurity vulnerability impact, and TRIAGE makes CVE-to-ATT&CK mapping more efficient.

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but
often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the
vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a
challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities
published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK
knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE
Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then
combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context
learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach
strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our
evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping
methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We
also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.
Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the
impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping
CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

*Runpeng Geng,Yanting Wang,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UniC-RAG is a universal knowledge corruption attack that uses optimized adversarial texts to simultaneously compromise multiple diverse queries in RAG systems, achieving high success rates while bypassing existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks, but prior work only targeted specific queries or similar topics. There's a need for a universal attack that can compromise diverse queries simultaneously to achieve broader malicious objectives.

Method: Formulated as an optimization problem, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts using a balanced similarity-based clustering method to attack multiple queries across different domains simultaneously.

Result: Achieved over 90% attack success rate by injecting only 100 adversarial texts into a knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack 2,000 diverse user queries, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: UniC-RAG demonstrates highly effective universal attacks against RAG systems, and existing defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for new defense mechanisms to protect RAG systems from such sophisticated attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in
real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to
knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts
into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate
attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific
queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose
UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike
prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that
can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics
and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such
as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,
or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an
optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,
including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's
effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly
effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could
achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a
knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set
of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and
show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the
need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

*Shaswata Mitra,Azim Bazarov,Martin Duclos,Sudip Mittal,Aritran Piplai,Md Rayhanur Rahman,Edward Zieglar,Shahram Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FALCON is an autonomous agentic framework that uses LLMs to generate IDS rules from CTI data in real-time with built-in validation, achieving 95% accuracy and reducing deployment delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional signature-based IDS require frequent manual rule updates from CTI, causing deployment delays that weaken security readiness against evolving cyber threats.

Method: FALCON uses LLM-powered agentic systems to autonomously generate deployable IDS rules from CTI data with multi-phased built-in validators, targeting both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) systems.

Result: The framework achieves 95% average accuracy in automatic rule generation, with 84% inter-rater agreement among cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.

Conclusion: LLM-driven data mining is feasible and effective for real-time cyber threat mitigation, enabling autonomous IDS rule generation with high accuracy and reduced deployment time.

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities
by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are
derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack
signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual
threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into
actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and
prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates
frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security
readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with
internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that
generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them
using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target
both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a
comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our
evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an
average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%
inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.
These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data
mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Alexandra Klymenko,Andreea-Elena Bodea,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMs can both exploit and improve differentially private text sanitization - they can reconstruct original content from DP-sanitized texts but also enhance privacy protection through adversarial post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Large Language Models can exploit contextual vulnerabilities in differentially private text sanitization methods and explore their dual role in both compromising and enhancing privacy.

Method: Expanded previous work by testing advanced LLMs on a broader range of DP sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels, conducting data reconstruction attacks and analyzing the double-edged sword effect.

Result: LLMs can infer original semantics from DP-sanitized texts and sometimes degrade empirical privacy, but they can also be used to improve the quality and privacy of sanitized texts through post-processing.

Conclusion: LLM-based data reconstruction should be used as an adversarial post-processing step to increase privacy protection, turning the vulnerability into a strength by thinking adversarially about privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.

*Rui Zhang,Zihan Wang,Tianli Yang,Hongwei Li,Wenbo Jiang,Qingchuan Zhao,Yang Liu,Guowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Hidden Tail is a stealthy resource consumption attack on Vision-Language Models that crafts adversarial images to induce maximum-length outputs with invisible special tokens, balancing effectiveness and stealthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM resource consumption attacks compromise stealthiness by generating abnormal visible content, creating a trade-off between attack effectiveness and stealthiness that needs to be addressed.

Method: Uses prompt-agnostic adversarial images with composite loss function balancing semantic preservation, repetitive special token induction, and EOS token suppression, optimized via dynamic weighting strategy.

Result: Outperforms existing attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2x and reaching maximum token limit while preserving attack stealthiness.

Conclusion: Demonstrates urgent need to improve VLM robustness against efficiency-oriented adversarial threats, with Hidden Tail successfully achieving both high effectiveness and stealthiness.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Security Operations Centre (SOC) specialists voluntarily use large language models (LLMs) during live security operations, as human-automation teams with transformer-based models represent a new wave of collaboration in cybersecurity.

Method: Analyzed 10 months of SOC operator interactions with GPT-4 through an internal HTTP-based chat application using two topic modeling approaches: established BERTopic model and a novel topic modeling workflow.

Result: Both modeling approaches revealed that ~40% of SOC LLM usage was for understanding complex text strings and commands, showing operators naturally leverage LLMs to interpret security-related information rapidly.

Conclusion: SOC operators' natural tendency to use LLMs for interpreting complex commands indicates their workflow can be enhanced by designing collaborative LLM tools specifically for SOC environments, such as integrated context menu solutions.

Abstract: Objective: This work describes the topic modelling of Security Operations
Centre (SOC) use of a large language model (LLM), during live security
operations. The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily
use this tool.
  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but
transformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC
personnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live
security operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the
LLM into their work.
  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing
GPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two
topic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model
(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.
  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed
that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of
complex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM
usage.
  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands
and similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support
this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by
designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.
  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security
Operations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows
supporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for
executing a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.

### [308] [PRISM: Robust VLM Alignment with Principled Reasoning for Integrated Safety in Multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18649)
*Nanxi Li,Zhengyue Zhao,Chaowei Xiao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PRISM introduces a safety framework for vision-language models that uses structured reasoning and preference optimization to achieve strong defense against attacks while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM safety methods suffer from over-defense that harms utility or shallow alignment that fails to detect complex threats requiring deep reasoning.

Method: PRISM uses a system2-like framework with PRISM-CoT dataset for safety-aware chain-of-thought reasoning and PRISM-DPO generated via Monte Carlo Tree Search for Direct Preference Optimization to refine safety boundaries.

Result: Achieved remarkably low attack success rates (0.15% on JailbreakV-28K), 90% improvement over previous best methods, strong robustness against adaptive attacks, and generalization to out-of-distribution challenges while preserving/enhancing model utility.

Conclusion: PRISM provides an effective framework for VLM safety that balances robust defense with maintained utility through structured reasoning processes.

Abstract: Safeguarding vision-language models (VLMs) is a critical challenge, as
existing methods often suffer from over-defense, which harms utility, or rely
on shallow alignment, failing to detect complex threats that require deep
reasoning. To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated
Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by
embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists
of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware
chain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference
Optimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack
success rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90%
improvement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also
exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing
computational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on
the challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is
achieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility. To
promote reproducibility, we have made our code, data, and model weights
available at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/PRISM.

*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel APT detection framework combining deep learning, reinforcement learning, and active learning for adaptive defense against stealthy cyber threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional signature-based detection systems fail against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) due to their static nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies.

Method: Combines auto-encoders for latent behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL defenders (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial defenders). Uses active learning for expert feedback simulation and ensemble voting weighted by agent performance.

Result: The framework provides adaptive detection capabilities that can evolve with changing attack strategies, overcoming limitations of static detection systems.

Conclusion: The integrated approach of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and active learning creates a cohesive, adaptive defense system effective against sophisticated APT attacks.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern
digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,
adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.
This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep
learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,
adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent
behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each
trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We
identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static
nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our
architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial
defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When
any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active
learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.
An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures
robust final predictions.

*Joshua Lee,Ali Arastehfard,Weiran Liu,Xuegang Ban,Yuan Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecureV2X is a scalable multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences in V2X systems, addressing privacy concerns in autonomous driving applications while achieving significant performance improvements over existing secure computation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems raises serious privacy concerns, particularly for applications that can reveal user locations or disclose sensitive medical data like EEG signals, necessitating secure computation solutions.

Method: Proposed SecureV2X, a scalable multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between servers and vehicles, tested on two V2X applications: secure drowsiness detection and secure red-light violation detection.

Result: SecureV2X achieves 9.4x faster performance, requires 143x fewer computational rounds, and involves 16.6x less communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems. It also achieves nearly 100x faster runtime than state-of-the-art benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.

Conclusion: The proposed SecureV2X system effectively addresses privacy concerns in V2X applications while maintaining strong performance and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale secure computation interactions in autonomous driving environments.

Abstract: Autonomous driving and V2X technologies have developed rapidly in the past
decade, leading to improved safety and efficiency in modern transportation.
These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside
infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning
capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems
raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly
concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can
implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as
EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable,
multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the
server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X
applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation
detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and
scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions
simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires
$143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less
communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems.
Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art
benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.

### [311] [Deterministic Coreset Construction via Adaptive Sensitivity Trimming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18340)
*Faruk Alpay,Taylan Alpay*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ADUWT algorithm constructs optimal deterministic coresets for ERM by trimming low-sensitivity points and applying adaptive uniform weights, achieving (1Â±Îµ) approximation with instance-dependent size bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a rigorous deterministic framework for coreset construction in empirical risk minimization that provides uniform approximation guarantees across the entire hypothesis space.

Method: Adaptive Deterministic Uniform-Weight Trimming (ADUWT) algorithm that removes points with lowest sensitivity bounds and applies data-dependent uniform weights to remaining points, with sensitivity oracles for specific ML models.

Result: Achieves uniform (1Â±Îµ) relative-error approximation for ERM objective, provides minimax optimality proof, instance-dependent size analysis via Sensitivity Heterogeneity Index, and tractable implementations for kernel methods.

Conclusion: The method provides theoretically grounded deterministic coresets with practical implementations, opening directions for instance-optimal oracles, deterministic streaming, and fairness-constrained ERM applications.

Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for deterministic coreset construction in
empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our central contribution is the Adaptive
Deterministic Uniform-Weight Trimming (ADUWT) algorithm, which constructs a
coreset by excising points with the lowest sensitivity bounds and applying a
data-dependent uniform weight to the remainder. The method yields a uniform
$(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative-error approximation for the ERM objective over the
entire hypothesis space. We provide complete analysis, including (i) a minimax
characterization proving the optimality of the adaptive weight, (ii) an
instance-dependent size analysis in terms of a \emph{Sensitivity Heterogeneity
Index}, and (iii) tractable sensitivity oracles for kernel ridge regression,
regularized logistic regression, and linear SVM. Reproducibility is supported
by precise pseudocode for the algorithm, sensitivity oracles, and evaluation
pipeline. Empirical results align with the theory. We conclude with open
problems on instance-optimal oracles, deterministic streaming, and
fairness-constrained ERM.

### [312] [Revisiting Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader with Unbounded Perturbations in Bandit Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18604)
*Jongyeong Lee,Junya Honda,Shinji Ito,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) with asymmetric unbounded FrÃ©chet-type perturbations, extending beyond previous limitations and offering competitive alternatives to hybrid regularization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the analytical foundations of FTPL and address the limited BOBW results compared to FTRL, particularly by exploring unbounded perturbations and their connections to regularization methods.

Method: Revisits classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded perturbations, establishes BOBW results for FTPL under asymmetric unbounded FrÃ©chet-type perturbations, and investigates the connection between $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and FrÃ©chet-type perturbations through numerical observations and theoretical analysis.

Result: Achieves BOBW guarantees for FTPL with asymmetric unbounded FrÃ©chet-type perturbations and establishes the first BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in two-armed bandits. However, finds limitations with symmetric FrÃ©chet-type perturbations in general multi-armed bandits where they violate key BOBW conditions.

Conclusion: The work extends FTPL's BOBW capabilities but reveals important limitations of symmetric perturbations in general settings, emphasizing the need for further investigation to fully understand FTPL behavior and the challenges in directly applying two-armed case insights to broader contexts.

Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policies have achieved
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results in various settings through hybrid
regularizers, whereas analogous results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)
remain limited due to inherent analytical challenges. To advance the analytical
foundations of FTPL, we revisit classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded
perturbations and establish BOBW results for FTPL under a broad family of
asymmetric unbounded Fr\'echet-type perturbations, including hybrid
perturbations combining Gumbel-type and Fr\'echet-type tails. These results not
only extend the BOBW results of FTPL but also offer new insights into designing
alternative FTPL policies competitive with hybrid regularization approaches.
Motivated by earlier observations in two-armed bandits, we further investigate
the connection between the $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and a Fr\'echet-type
perturbation. Our numerical observations suggest that it corresponds to a
symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbation, and based on this, we establish the
first BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in the two-armed
setting. In contrast, in general multi-armed bandits, we find an instance in
which symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbations violate the key condition for
standard BOBW analysis, which is a problem not observed with asymmetric or
nonnegative Fr\'echet-type perturbations. Although this example does not rule
out alternative analyses achieving BOBW results, it suggests the limitations of
directly applying the relationship observed in two-armed cases to the general
case and thus emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand
the behavior of FTPL in broader settings.

*Mengmeng Li,Philipp Schneider,Jelisaveta AleksiÄ,Daniel Kuhn*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: First best-of-both-worlds algorithm for contextual combinatorial semi-bandits achieving O(âT) adversarial regret and O(ln T) corrupted stochastic regret using FTRL with Shannon entropy regularizer, with efficient projection via KKT conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a contextual combinatorial semi-bandits algorithm that performs well in both adversarial and stochastic environments while addressing computational bottlenecks in FTRL implementations.

Method: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework with Shannon entropy regularizer, transforming high-dimensional projection into single-variable root-finding using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

Result: Achieves O(âT) regret in adversarial regime and O(ln T) regret in corrupted stochastic regime, with substantial per-round computational speed-ups.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides both strong theoretical regret guarantees and practical computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale real-time applications.

Abstract: We introduce the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for contextual
combinatorial semi-bandits that simultaneously guarantees
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial regime and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\ln T)$ regret in the corrupted stochastic regime. Our
approach builds on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework equipped
with a Shannon entropy regularizer, yielding a flexible method that admits
efficient implementations. Beyond regret bounds, we tackle the practical
bottleneck in FTRL (or, equivalently, Online Stochastic Mirror Descent) arising
from the high-dimensional projection step encountered in each round of
interaction. By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we transform the
$K$-dimensional convex projection problem into a single-variable root-finding
problem, dramatically accelerating each round. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that this combined strategy not only attains the attractive regret
bounds of best-of-both-worlds algorithms but also delivers substantial
per-round speed-ups, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-time
applications.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A feature screening method that integrates feature-feature and feature-target relationships using penalized mRMR with non-convex regularization to identify inactive features while controlling false discovery rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a feature selection method that effectively identifies inactive features by considering both feature interactions and target relationships, while providing statistical guarantees on false discovery control without requiring pre-specified feature numbers.

Method: Penalized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure with non-convex regularizer, using knockoff filter for multi-stage feature screening to control false discovery rate.

Result: Method performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO but is more conservative in feature selection, requires only FDR threshold setting instead of specifying feature numbers, and demonstrates effectiveness through simulations and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed penalized mRMR approach with knockoff filter provides an effective feature screening method that integrates feature relationships, guarantees accurate inactive feature identification, and controls false discovery rate with minimal parameter specification.

Abstract: We propose a feature screening method that integrates both feature-feature
and feature-target relationships. Inactive features are identified via a
penalized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, which is the
continuous version of the classic mRMR penalized by a non-convex regularizer,
and where the parameters estimated as zero coefficients represent the set of
inactive features. We establish the conditions under which zero coefficients
are correctly identified to guarantee accurate recovery of inactive features.
We introduce a multi-stage procedure based on the knockoff filter enabling the
penalized mRMR to discard inactive features while controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR). Our method performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO but is more
conservative in the number of selected features. It only requires setting an
FDR threshold, rather than specifying the number of features to retain. The
effectiveness of the method is illustrated through simulations and real-world
datasets. The code to reproduce this work is available on the following GitHub:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Various memory concepts in RNNs are often used interchangeably but their precise relationships remain unclear, creating confusion in understanding how RNNs process temporal information.

Result: The research establishes clear relationships between different memory concepts in RNNs, revealing equivalences and implications that were previously unclear.

Conclusion: By clarifying the relationships between memory concepts, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information processing capabilities, providing a unified framework for future research.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in
information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A
fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output
responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the
information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize
the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state
forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are
often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This
work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications
and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing
results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research
contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information

TL;DR: ClusterFusion introduces cluster-level communication primitives and a fused execution framework that reduces LLM decoding latency by 1.61x on average by enabling on-chip data exchange and expanding operator fusion scope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM decoding suffers from high latency due to fragmented execution across operators, heavy off-chip memory reliance, and limited fusion opportunities despite modern GPU architectures providing distributed shared memory capabilities.

Method: Introduces ClusterReduce and ClusterGather primitives for structured on-chip communication between thread blocks, then builds ClusterFusion framework that jointly schedules communication and computation to fuse decoding stages (QKV Projection, Attention, Output Projection) into single kernels.

Result: Evaluation on H100 GPUs shows 1.61x average improvement in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art inference frameworks across various models and configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed cluster-level communication abstractions and fused execution framework effectively bridge the software-hardware gap, significantly reducing LLM decoding latency by minimizing off-chip memory traffic and kernel launch overhead.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to
fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for
data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for
fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While
modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory
and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data
movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip
communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two
cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which
abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data
exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing
intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building
on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that
schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope
by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output
Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that
ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on
average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations. The

TL;DR: CARMA is a resource management system that enables efficient GPU sharing for deep learning training tasks by preventing out-of-memory crashes and minimizing performance interference through ML-based memory estimation and utilization capping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise GPU infrastructure often suffers from significant underutilization, but collocating DL training tasks risks out-of-memory crashes and performance slowdowns due to resource interference.

Method: CARMA uses GPUMemNet (ML-based GPU memory estimator) to prevent OOM errors, implements collocation policies with GPU utilization caps to minimize interference, and includes a recovery method for crashed tasks.

Result: CARMA increases GPU utilization by 39.3%, reduces end-to-end execution time by ~26.7%, and decreases GPU energy consumption by ~14.2% compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: CARMA effectively addresses GPU underutilization in DL training through intelligent task collocation while maintaining robustness and improving both performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs --
the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often
significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to
address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for
the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU
due to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to
robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy
efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource
management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses
GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training
tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies
that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA
introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our
evaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows
that CARMA increases the GPU utilization over time by 39.3\%, decreases the
end-to-end execution time by $\sim$26.7\%, and reduces the GPU energy use by
$\sim$14.2\%.

TL;DR: A topological framework combining Transfer Entropy and directed Persistent Homology to analyze information flow in neural systems, revealing complex interaction patterns beyond pairwise connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled approach for characterizing directed information flow in neural systems by integrating temporal dynamics with topological structure analysis.

Method: Transfer Entropy quantifies directional influence between neurons to create weighted directed graphs, then Persistent Homology analyzes these graphs to assess topological complexity across multiple scales and dimensions.

Result: The framework successfully distinguishes task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regimes across synthetic networks, image-classification systems, and mouse cortical recordings, with higher-dimensional features emerging in complex/noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The TE+PH pipeline provides an interpretable and generalizable method for mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems with time-resolved spiking data.

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

*Shrenik Jadhav,Birva Sevak,Srijita Das,Akhtar Hussain,Wencong Su,Van-Hai Bui*

TL;DR: FairMarket-RL is a fairness-aware multiagent reinforcement learning framework using LLM critics to ensure equitable P2P energy trading outcomes while maintaining economic efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing P2P energy trading markets focus on efficiency and private profit but lack real-time guidance for ensuring equitable outcomes under uncertainty, creating a need for fairness-aware approaches.

Method: Uses LLM critics to shape bidding policies in continuous double auctions, returning normalized fairness scores (FTG, FBS, FPP) integrated into rewards via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling. Models realistic residential load/PV profiles with hard constraints on prices, feasibility, and stability.

Result: Shifts exchanges toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves utility viability. Shows robust performance across varying solar availability and demand.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, LLM-guided pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient, socially equitable, and technically sound.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution
systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet
most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or
private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes
under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent
reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large
language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double
auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After
each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid
(FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are
integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that
fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The
environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard
constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability.
Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated
community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges
toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only
procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves
utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate
demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided
pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient,
socially equitable, and technically sound.

### [321] [Mining the Long Tail: A Comparative Study of Data-Centric Criticality Metrics for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18397)
*Antonio Guillen-Perez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Offline RL for autonomous vehicles suffers from data imbalance where rare events are underrepresented. This paper systematically compares 6 data curation strategies across 3 categories to improve safety and performance, finding that model uncertainty-based weighting reduces collisions by nearly 3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL from real-world driving logs faces extreme data imbalance where mundane scenarios vastly outnumber rare 'long-tail' events, leading to brittle and unsafe policies with standard uniform sampling.

Method: Six criticality weighting schemes categorized into heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based approaches, evaluated at two temporal scales (timestep and scenario level). Trained seven goal-conditioned CQL agents with attention-based architecture in Waymax simulator.

Result: All data curation methods significantly outperformed baseline. Model uncertainty-based weighting achieved most significant safety improvements, reducing collision rate from 16.0% to 5.5%. Timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning.

Conclusion: Intelligent non-uniform sampling is critical for building safe autonomous agents. The work provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL with clear trade-offs between different temporal weighting approaches.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

### [322] [Enhancing Video-Based Robot Failure Detection Using Task Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18705)
*Santosh Thoduka,Sebastian Houben,Juergen Gall,Paul G. PlÃ¶ger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Video-based failure detection using spatio-temporal knowledge (robot actions and task-relevant objects) improves robotic execution monitoring with F1 scores increasing from 77.9 to 81.4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust robotic task execution requires reliable failure detection, but many existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios, necessitating better approaches that leverage available contextual information.

Method: Proposes a video-based failure detection approach that utilizes spatio-temporal knowledge including robot actions and task-relevant objects within the field of view, with data augmentation using variable frame rates.

Result: Achieved improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 F1 score on ARMBench dataset without additional computational cost, and further increased to 81.4 with test-time augmentation.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal information is crucial for effective failure detection, and the proposed approach demonstrates significant performance improvements while suggesting further investigation of suitable heuristics for future implementations.

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code
and annotations are available.

*Hichem Cheriet,Khellat Kihel Badra,Chouraqui Samira*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TIG algorithm for UAV path planning uses elliptic tangent intersection method to generate optimal paths in static and dynamic environments, outperforming existing algorithms in speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and safe UAV navigation is critical for applications like combat support, package delivery, and search/rescue operations, requiring advanced path planning algorithms.

Method: Uses elliptic tangent intersection method to generate two sub-paths per threat, selects optimal route via heuristic rules, iteratively refines path, and applies modified quadratic BÃ©zier curves for smoothing with kinematic constraints.

Result: Generates shortest paths in under 0.01 seconds with fewer turning angles, outperforming A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent Graph, and Static APPATT in static environments, and APF/Dynamic APPATT in unknown/dynamic environments.

Conclusion: TIG algorithm provides efficient real-time path planning for UAVs with superior performance in both static and dynamic environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

*Shreya Gummadi,Mateus V. Gasparino,Gianluca Capezzuto,Marcelo Becker,Girish Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ZeST uses LLMs for zero-shot terrain traversability prediction, eliminating risky real-world data collection while enabling safer robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods require exposing robots to hazardous environments for data collection, posing equipment and safety risks.

Method: Leverages visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to create real-time traversability maps without physical risk.

Result: Safer navigation in both controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments, consistently reaching goals compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Provides cost-effective, scalable solution that accelerates development of advanced navigation systems while mitigating safety risks.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art
methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

### [325] [MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236)
*Hao Shi,Bin Xie,Yingfei Liu,Lin Sun,Fengrong Liu,Tiancai Wang,Erjin Zhou,Haoqiang Fan,Xiangyu Zhang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MemoryVLA is a cognitive-inspired framework that integrates working memory and long-term memory mechanisms into vision-language-action models to handle long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks with temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream VLA models struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent robotic manipulation tasks because they overlook temporal context. The work is inspired by human cognitive mechanisms where working memory handles immediate control while the hippocampal system preserves detailed episodic memories for long-term use.

Method: Proposes MemoryVLA with a Cognition-Memory-Action framework. Uses a pretrained VLM to encode observations into perceptual/cognitive tokens for working memory. A Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics. Working memory retrieves relevant entries, fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank. A memory-conditioned diffusion action expert generates temporally aware action sequences.

Result: Achieved 71.9% on SimplerEnv-Bridge, 72.7% on Fractal, and 96.5% on LIBERO-5 suites, outperforming CogACT and pi-0 baselines with +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks, achieved 84.0% success rate with long-horizon tasks showing +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

Conclusion: MemoryVLA successfully addresses the temporal context limitation in VLA models by incorporating cognitive memory mechanisms, demonstrating significant performance improvements in both simulated and real-world long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

TL;DR: AgriChrono is a robotic platform and multi-modal dataset for precision agriculture that captures dynamic real-world field conditions with multiple synchronized sensors, addressing limitations of existing static datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing precision agriculture datasets are collected in controlled environments with limited sensor diversity and temporal span, failing to reflect real farmland dynamics like illumination changes and crop growth variation, leading to poor model robustness and generalization.

Method: Developed a robotic data collection platform integrating multiple sensors for remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, enabling efficient long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.

Result: Benchmarked state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on AgriChrono, demonstrating the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world field environments and the dataset's value for advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: AgriChrono provides a valuable research asset for improving model robustness in precision agriculture by capturing realistic dynamic field conditions, with both code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often
with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions
fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination
changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models
trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to
real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel
robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture
the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform
integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition
of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable
long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.
We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the
AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world
field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for
advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions. The code and dataset

*Colin Merk,Ismail Geles,Jiaxu Xing,Angel Romero,Giorgia Ramponi,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PbRL with REC extension achieves 88.4% of shaped reward performance for agile drone control, successfully transferring acrobatic maneuvers from simulation to real drones while capturing human stylistic preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acrobatic flight requires complex dynamics and precise execution that are difficult to formalize with manual reward functions. PbRL is well-suited for tasks with subjective objectives where human preferences matter more than engineered rewards.

Method: Proposed Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization that improves preference modeling and learning stability for agile drone maneuvers like powerloops.

Result: REC achieved 88.4% of shaped reward performance vs 55.2% with standard Preference PPO. Policies trained in simulation successfully transferred to real drones for multiple acrobatic maneuvers. Manual rewards only had 60.7% agreement with human preferences.

Conclusion: PbRL with REC effectively captures complex human-centered objectives across physical and simulated domains, demonstrating superiority over manually designed rewards for tasks requiring stylistic quality and subjective evaluation.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement
with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in
capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated
domains.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: URSA enables autonomous discovery of diverse robot skills directly in real world without manual supervision, outperforming baselines in damage adaptation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require manually defined skill spaces and tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability for autonomous skill discovery.

Method: Extension of Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC) that supports both heuristic-driven and fully unsupervised skill discovery on physical robots.

Result: Successfully discovered diverse locomotion skills on Unitree A1 quadruped in simulation and real world, outperformed baselines in 5/9 simulated and 3/5 real-world damage scenarios.

Conclusion: Establishes a framework for continuous real-world skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing significant progress toward autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

*Alex LaGrassa,Zixuan Huang,Dmitry Berenson,Oliver Kroemer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method that automatically generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning optimal resolution requirements for different object regions based on planning queries, using diffusion-based prediction and two-stage optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces like deformable object manipulation requires computationally tractable yet expressive dynamics models. Current approaches often use fixed-resolution models that are either too coarse (inaccurate) or too fine (computationally expensive).

Method: Diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region model resolutions from start and goal pointclouds. Two-stage data collection: first optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as prior, then directly optimizes using closed-loop performance.

Result: On tree-manipulation task, the method doubles planning speed with only small decrease in task performance compared to full-resolution models.

Conclusion: This approach enables using previous planning data to generate computationally efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks, providing a path towards adaptive resolution modeling in complex manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

*ZhenDong Chen,ZhanShang Nie,ShiXing Wan,JunYi Li,YongTian Cheng,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NRTrans framework uses Robot Skill Language (RSL) with compiler verification and feedback-based fine-tuning to ensure correctness of LLM-generated robot control programs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for robot control program generation suffer from programming errors due to LLM inconsistency and task complexity, especially with light-weight LLMs, undermining effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Robot Skill Language (RSL) to abstract control program details, then uses RSL compiler/debugger to verify LLM-generated programs and provide error feedback for iterative refinement until verified.

Result: NRTrans outperforms existing methods across various LLMs and tasks, achieving high success rates particularly for light-weight LLMs with correctness guarantees before execution.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances LLM-powered robotic applications by providing correctness verification and feedback-based improvement, making light-weight LLMs more effective for robot control.

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range
of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for robotic assistants that handles uncertainty in human intention recognition using POMDP-based planning and real-time sensor integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic assistants either rely on explicit prompts (limiting autonomy) or make unrealistic assumptions about perfect information, failing to address the inherent uncertainty and perception errors in human intention recognition.

Method: Developed an integrated framework centered around an intention-recognition POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) that combines real-time sensor data with multiple planners to enable cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty.

Result: The framework was successfully tested on a physical robot and demonstrated promising results in handling uncertainty and sensor noise.

Conclusion: The proposed POMDP-based framework effectively addresses the critical challenge of reasoning about uncertain outcomes and perception errors in human intention recognition, enabling more autonomous and resilient robotic assistance.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of
multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced
to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to
uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a
combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve real-time multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on autonomous robots using biological-inspired core knowledge principles, improving upon reactive single-step planning approaches.

Method: Developed purpose-built model checking algorithm using forward depth-first search, chaining temporary control systems to counteract environmental disturbances, with novel 2D LiDAR data discretization sensitive to bounded variations.

Result: Successful multi-step planning demonstrated in cul-de-sac and playground scenarios, showing improved performance over reactive agents with empirical results and informal proofs of fundamental properties.

Conclusion: Model checking enables efficient multi-step planning for local obstacle avoidance, serving as an instructional case study for developing safe, reliable, and explainable planning in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

Main category: hep-th

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theoretical framework that connects deep neural networks with quantum field theory, specifically quantum electrodynamics, to gain new insights into DNN behavior and stability through established QED techniques.

Method: A Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach mapping DNNs to QED with local U(1) symmetry, using Langevin time for covariant gauge fixing, and implementing gauge-invariant neural networks with magnitude-phase parameterization.

Result: The mapping successfully relates kernel design choices to gauge parameters, connects finite-width fluctuations to QED loop corrections, and unifies computation of largest Lyapunov exponent between stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

Conclusion: The QED-DNN mapping provides a powerful theoretical framework for analyzing neural networks, enabling gauge-theoretic interpretations of network properties and offering new computational approaches through field theory techniques.

Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps
deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1)
symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by
fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling
covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel
design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent
amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections
in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through
numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel,
propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using
magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica
approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in
stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

TL;DR: A novel hotword customization system using hotword pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) that measures acoustic similarity to identify relevant hotwords, improving recognition rates for large-scale hotwords in ASR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR models struggle with large-scale hotwords as recognition rates drop dramatically when the number of hotwords increases, creating a need for better hotword customization solutions.

Method: Utilizes a hotword pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) that measures acoustic similarity between hotwords and speech segments to identify the most relevant candidates. This plug-and-play solution integrates with traditional models like SeACo-Paraformer and Audio LLMs through prompt-based approaches.

Result: Extensive testing validates that H-PRM outperforms existing methods, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate (PRR) and showing improved performance with large-scale hotwords.

Conclusion: H-PRM provides an effective plug-and-play solution for hotword customization that works with both traditional ASR models and Audio LLMs, representing a new direction for improving domain-specific term recognition in speech recognition systems.

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate

prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

*Lars Nieradzik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SwiftF0 is a lightweight neural model for monophonic pitch estimation that achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 95,842 parameters, running 42x faster than CREPE while maintaining robustness in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate real-time pitch estimation on resource-constrained devices in noisy environments remains challenging, and existing datasets lack perfectly accurate ground truth pitch data for robust training and evaluation.

Method: Developed SwiftF0 neural model trained on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data augmentation. Created SpeechSynth dataset with exact ground-truth pitch curves using phoneme-level TTS. Proposed unified evaluation metric combining six complementary performance measures.

Result: Achieved 91.80% harmonic mean at 10 dB SNR, outperforming CREPE by over 12 percentage points. Only 2.3% performance degradation from clean audio. Requires minimal parameters and runs 42x faster than CREPE on CPU.

Conclusion: SwiftF0 provides efficient, real-time pitch estimation suitable for resource-constrained devices, with robust performance in noisy conditions. The SpeechSynth dataset and unified benchmark framework enable better training and evaluation of pitch estimation models.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in
audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model
that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through
training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data
augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains
while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic
mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12
percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0
requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on
CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the
critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which
typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce
\emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level
TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more
robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric,
combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable
pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo
of SwiftF0 is available at https://swift-f0.github.io/, the source code at

*Qing Xiao,Yingshan Peng,PeiPei Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Multi-speaker fine-tuning on dysarthric speech improves individual recognition accuracy by 13.15% WER reduction compared to single-speaker approaches, through better generalization and reduced overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and disparities relative to normal speech, with conventional approaches requiring individual fine-tuning per patient which is inefficient.

Method: Multi-speaker fine-tuning approach that simultaneously trains ASR models on multiple dysarthric speakers instead of individual patient-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 13.15% lower Word Error Rate (WER) compared to single-speaker fine-tuning, with enhanced generalization, reduced speaker-specific overfitting, and lower per-patient data requirements.

Conclusion: Counter-intuitively, training on multiple dysarthric speakers simultaneously improves individual speech pattern recognition by enabling broader pathological feature learning and better generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and
disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually
fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent
feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker
fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves
recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances
generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates
speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves
target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus
single-speaker fine-tuning.

*Ridwan Arefeen,Xiaoxiao Miao,Rong Tong,Aik Beng Ng,Simon See*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SegReConcat is a data augmentation method that segments anonymized speech at word level, rearranges segments to disrupt contextual cues, and concatenates them to help attackers learn speaker traits from multiple perspectives, improving de-anonymization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice anonymization often leaves residual speaker cues that pose privacy risks, creating a need for methods to enhance attacker-side speaker verification systems to better evaluate privacy protection.

Method: SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at word level, rearranges segments using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual cues, and concatenates them with original utterances.

Result: Evaluated in VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 across seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improved de-anonymization performance on five out of seven systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances attacker capabilities in speaker verification by disrupting anonymization through strategic segmentation and rearrangement of speech segments.

Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while
maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often
persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation
method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems.
SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments
using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual
cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker
to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method
has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across
seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out

### [338] [Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665)
*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Min-Chun Chen,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates privacy risks in LLM-based recommender systems, demonstrating that membership inference attacks can successfully determine if a user's historical interactions were used in system prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based recommender systems use sensitive user interaction data in prompts for in-context learning, creating potential privacy risks through membership inference attacks that haven't been previously studied.

Method: The authors designed four novel membership inference attacks (direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks) that exploit unique features of LLMs and recommender systems, and evaluated them on three LLMs and two benchmark datasets.

Result: The attacks were highly effective, with direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages, confirming that MIA threats on LLM RecSys are realistic.

Conclusion: LLM-based recommender systems are vulnerable to privacy attacks that can reveal whether users' historical interactions were used in system prompts, highlighting the need for privacy protection measures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

*Jan Malte Lichtenberg,Antonio De Candia,Matteo Ruffini*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DenseRec introduces a dual-path embedding approach that projects dense content embeddings into ID embedding space, enabling transformer-based sequential recommenders to handle item cold-start problems effectively without complex infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based sequential recommenders rely solely on item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to item cold-start problems in dynamic item catalogs. While content embeddings offer potential solutions, direct integration has consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches.

Method: DenseRec proposes a dual-path embedding approach that learns a linear projection from dense embedding space into ID embedding space during training, enabling seamless generalization to unseen items without requiring specialized models or complex infrastructure.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show DenseRec consistently outperforms ID-only SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using compact embedding models. Improvements primarily come from better sequence representations with unseen items.

Conclusion: DenseRec provides a practical and robust solution for cold-start sequential recommendation, effectively addressing the item cold-start problem in transformer-based recommenders through simple yet effective dense content integration.

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec,
typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to
the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item
catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer
potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has
consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this
integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that
introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection
from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,
enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring
specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three
real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only
SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using
compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise
from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,
positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start
sequential recommendation.

*Yi-Ping Hsu,Po-Wei Wang,Chantat Eksombatchai,Jiajing Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel two-stage training strategy using pre-training with contrastive loss to address the one-epoch problem in ID-based embeddings for recommendation systems, improving generalization without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ID-based embeddings in recommendation systems suffer from overfitting due to long-tail data distributions, limiting training to one epoch (one-epoch problem). Current research focuses on optimizing within this single epoch, but this study aims to enable multi-epoch training without overfitting.

Method: Two-stage training strategy: 1) Pre-training phase using a minimal model with contrastive loss for broader data coverage, 2) Fine-tuning the embeddings for more complex downstream recommendation tasks.

Result: Offline experiments show multi-epoch pre-training doesn't cause overfitting. Deployed system at Pinterest achieved significant site-wide engagement gains with improved online generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage training approach successfully overcomes the one-epoch limitation in ID-based embeddings, enabling effective multi-epoch training through contrastive pre-training and achieving practical improvements in real-world recommendation systems.

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation
systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the
long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single
epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven
research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing
convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel
two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a
minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the
embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training
during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting
embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex
downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live
traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

*Kushagra Agrawal,Nisharg Nargund,Oishani Banerjee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression in vector similarity search, achieving higher semantic similarity and utility compared to FAISS with minimal query time trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector similarity search systems face scalability and efficiency challenges due to high dimensionality of transformer-based embeddings, requiring better compression methods that preserve semantic utility.

Method: Model compression strategy as zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage efficiency, deriving latent transformation that reduces redundancy while maintaining semantic similarity.

Result: Achieved significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873 vs. 0.5194) compared to FAISS, with modest query time increase.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic latent compression provides practical value for high-utility transformer-based search applications and can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines for more efficient retrieval.

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval
systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the
scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high
dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel
game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance
both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the
compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage
efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic
similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a
widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a
significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873
vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off
highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in
high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be
seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically
accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

TL;DR: A novel framework that converts natural language queries into query plans instead of SQL, enabling complex analytics like PCA and anomaly detection while handling large datasets efficiently without SQL limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-to-SQL approaches inherit SQL's drawbacks including inefficiency with large datasets and limited support for complex data analysis beyond basic querying, creating barriers for non-programming users.

Method: Leverages LLMs to iteratively interpret natural language queries and construct operation sequences, executing operations directly on data to avoid context length limitations and SQL constraints.

Result: Validated through experiments on standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides greater flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities, enabling complex analytical functions while efficiently processing large tabular datasets without SQL limitations.

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SISO is a semantic caching system for LLM serving that improves efficiency through centroid-based caching, locality-aware replacement, and dynamic thresholding, achieving 1.71Ã higher hit ratios and better SLO attainment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional caching strategies fail to meet strict SLOs for LLM serving under computational constraints - exact-matching and prefix caches ignore query semantics, while existing semantic caches offer little innovation.

Method: SISO introduces three key techniques: centroid-based caching to maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency under varying workloads.

Result: Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to 1.71Ã higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: SISO redefines efficiency for LLM serving by addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches with innovative semantic caching techniques that optimize both memory usage and performance.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints.
Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and
prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches
remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual
departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that
redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to
maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve
high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency
under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to
1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment
compared to state-of-the-art systems.

TL;DR: Gossip-based consensus protocol enables multiple LLMs to exchange answers and reach collective decisions, improving robustness and accuracy over single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single LLM excels in every area - each has strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one model, the paper draws inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems to enable collaborative decision-making.

Method: Models act as nodes in a peer-to-peer network, exchanging answers and thought processes through a gossip-based consensus protocol where information is shared with peers until agreement is reached.

Result: The gossip-based consensus approach leads to robust, resilient, and accurate multi-agent AI reasoning, helping overcome individual model weaknesses and bringing out collective strengths.

Conclusion: This collaborative approach makes AI seem more trustworthy and human-like in building consensus, moving away from black-box program behavior to more collaborative decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in
every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one
model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,
where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.
In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared
solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses
and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that
this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate
multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models
and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how
humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy
instead of just a black-box program.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Murakkab is a resource-efficient serving system for agentic workflows that decouples workflow specification from execution configuration, enabling cross-layer optimization to reduce GPU usage, energy consumption, and cost while maintaining service-level objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks for serving agentic workflows are inefficient because they expose workflows as opaque sequences of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware choices, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy, latency, energy, and cost.

Method: Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples workflow specification from execution configuration, using a profile-guided optimizer and adaptive runtime to jointly manage the full stack by orchestrating workflow components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring execution.

Result: Evaluation shows Murakkab reduces GPU usage by up to 2.8Ã, energy consumption by 3.7Ã, and cost by 4.3Ã while maintaining service-level objectives (SLOs).

Conclusion: By exposing the internal structure of agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve, making it a superior solution for efficient agentic workflow serving.

Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex
control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI
applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's
frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences
of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware
choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different
entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,
latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded
service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic
workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples
workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer
and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow
components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring
execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of
agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing
frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage
by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by
4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.

TL;DR: A multi-agent neuro-symbolic framework combining RL-based tutor and LLM-powered peer agents to support student-centered learning through structured guidance and social interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empower students to take ownership of their learning by addressing challenges in goal-setting, progress tracking, and adaptive strategies through AI-powered digital learning environments.

Method: A multi-agent framework with specialized roles: RL-based tutor agent provides non-verbal scaffolding, and LLM-powered peer agent facilitates social learning dimensions, unified through a central educational ontology.

Result: Demonstrated adaptability across domains through case studies in both college-level and middle school settings, showing the framework's effectiveness in varied educational contexts.

Conclusion: The framework offers transformative potential for AI-driven learning environments, with future directions focusing on advancing socially interactive and scalable educational support systems.

Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future
directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.

TL;DR: FairSkillMARL framework combines workload balance and skill-task alignment for fairness in healthcare MARL, with MARLHospital environment for testing. Results show workload-only fairness causes skill mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL fairness approaches focus only on workload balance, ignoring agent expertise and structured coordination needed in real-world domains like healthcare where both workload distribution and skill alignment are critical to prevent burnout.

Method: Proposed FairSkillMARL framework with dual fairness objectives (workload balance + skill-task alignment) and created MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling impacts.

Result: Experiments comparing FairSkillMARL with standard MARL methods and state-of-the-art fairness metrics showed that fairness based solely on equal workload leads to task-skill mismatches, highlighting the need for metrics that capture skill-task alignment.

Conclusion: The work provides tools and foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical, demonstrating that robust fairness metrics must consider both workload distribution and skill-task alignment.

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort
with expertise is critical.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Data-driven approach enhances quasi-steady aerodynamic models for insect flight by identifying and formulating three previously overlooked mechanisms, significantly improving prediction accuracy across different Reynolds numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding unsteady aerodynamic forces in insect flight face trade-offs between computational expense and accuracy. High-fidelity simulations are expensive and lack explanatory power, while theoretical quasi-steady models offer insights but have low accuracy.

Method: Applied data-driven approach to discover and formulate critical mechanisms from 5,000 candidate kinematic functions. Identified mathematical expressions for three key additional mechanisms: effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect.

Result: Incorporating these mechanisms considerably reduced prediction errors of the quasi-steady model using CFD results as ground truth, validated in both hawkmoth forward flight (high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (low Reynolds numbers).

Conclusion: The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid aerodynamic analysis and serves as a practical tool for understanding evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying robots.

Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate
complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology,
physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs:
high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and
lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady
assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these
limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models,
we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of
previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000
candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three
key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise
kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been
qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these
mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model
using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in
hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at
low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid
aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding
evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying
robots.

However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMAR improves VAR by using next-scale prediction and masked generation, achieving better image quality, faster training/inference, and flexibility in sampling and editing.", "motivation": "VAR's parallel token generation reduces image quality, scales poorly with resolution, and lacks flexibility in sampling.

To make\nhyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a\nnovel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to\nachieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than\ntraining-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load.

Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first\nperform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that\nindicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks\nare introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined\nwith the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During\ntraining, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and\nchallenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and\nrobustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal\nconsistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning\nstrategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the\nmodel is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning\niteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference\nto enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior\nknowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,\nenabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence.

Extensive\nevaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,\nGPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference\nlatency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while\nmaintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art\nspeculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong\nperformance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by\n48-58%.

We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy.

Our work offers three major\ncontributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest\nGB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than\nexisting datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution\nproblem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three\ndistinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)\nComprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category\nscenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar\ncharacter recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also\nunlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our\nknowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not\nonly in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern\nrecognition.

One prominent laundering method for evading\nthese controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into\nsmaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve\nmultiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has\nbecome an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have\nfocused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has\nhindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a\nnovel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single\ninterpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction\nnetwork of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,\nGARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection\npower and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML\nworkflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score\ncalculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores\nof the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic\nand open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art smurfing detection methods.

To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "POSSM is a hybrid architecture combining spike tokenization and a recurrent state-space model for real-time neural decoding, offering fast, accurate, and generalizable performance with lower computational cost.", "motivation": "Address the trade-off between generalization (Transformers) and speed (traditional methods) in real-time neural decoding for neuroscience and neurotechnology.", "method": "POSSM uses cross-attention for spike tokenization and a recurrent SSM backbone, enabling causal online prediction and multi-dataset pretraining.", "result": "POSSM matches Transformer accuracy in decoding tasks (monkey motor, human handwriting, speech) but is up to 9x faster on GPU.", "conclusion": "Hybrid SSMs like POSSM bridge accuracy, speed, and generalization, making them promising for real-time neural decoding applications."}}

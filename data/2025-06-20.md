Conclusion: SemIRNet effectively addresses multimodal irony detection challenges, demonstrating the value of knowledge fusion and semantic modeling in improving performance.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples. Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64% and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model performance.

Conclusion: ViLLa offers a modular and interpretable approach to animal monitoring, outperforming black-box models by separating perception, understanding, and reasoning.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.

### [5] [GraphGSOcc: Semantic and Geometric Graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14825)
*Ke Song,Yunhe Wu,Chunchit Siu,Huiyuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphGSOcc model improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction by addressing feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities in 3DGS methods, achieving better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods lack semantic correlation handling and geometric constraints, leading to poor feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities.

Method: Proposes GraphGSOcc with Dual Gaussians Graph Attention (geometric and semantic graphs) and Multi-scale Graph Attention for fine and coarse-grained feature modeling.

Result: Achieves 24.10% mIoU on SurroundOcc dataset with 1.97% improvement and 13.7% memory reduction (6.1 GB GPU usage).

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc effectively combines semantic and geometric features, enhancing 3D occupancy prediction performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld

*Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Hongyu Su,Juncheng Li,Yunhan Zhao,Lin Luo,Zixing Chen,Li Wang,Xin Wang,Yixu Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVID-X introduces a dataset with detailed annotations for AI-generated videos, and DAVID-XR1, a model providing interpretable reasoning for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable, explainable methods to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones, beyond binary classification.

Method: Creation of DAVID-X dataset with defect-level annotations and DAVID-XR1, a video-language model for interpretable detection.

Result: Strong generalization across generators and modes, demonstrating the effectiveness of explainable detection.

Conclusion: Explainable methods like DAVID-XR1 offer transparent and verifiable AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms, the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However, the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

### [10] [MonoVQD: Monocular 3D Object Detection with Variational Query Denoising and Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14835)
*Kiet Dang Vu,Trung Thai Tran,Duc Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD introduces a novel DETR-based framework for monocular 3D detection, featuring Mask Separated Self-Attention, Variational Query Denoising, and self-distillation to improve performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of DETR-like architectures in monocular 3D detection, particularly in stability and denoising efficiency.

Method: Proposes Mask Separated Self-Attention, Variational Query Denoising, and a self-distillation strategy to enhance query quality and optimization.

Result: Achieves superior performance on the KITTI benchmark and demonstrates robust generalization on nuScenes.

Conclusion: MonoVQD advances monocular 3D detection with innovative techniques, showing broad applicability and significant performance gains.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

### [11] [Improved Iterative Refinement for Chart-to-Code Generation via Structured Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14837)
*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartIR, an iterative refinement method for improving chart-to-code generation in MLLMs by using structured instructions and a two-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with chart-to-code generation due to the need for precise visual understanding and accurate code translation. Direct prompting often fails, necessitating a better approach.

Method: ChartIR splits the task into visual understanding (using description and difference instructions) and code translation, then refines the output iteratively.

Result: ChartIR outperforms other methods on models like Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Structured instructions and iterative refinement significantly enhance MLLMs' chart-to-code generation performance.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities. While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

*Lukas Schiesser,Cornelius Wolff,Sophie Haas,Simon Pukrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictSure is an ICL framework for few-shot image classification, focusing on the role of image embeddings to improve out-of-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the overlooked role of image embeddings in ICL-based FSIC pipelines to enhance generalization in data-scarce domains.

Method: Systematically analyzes visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies for embedding models.

Result: PictSure outperforms existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks while maintaining in-domain performance.

Conclusion: The success of ICL-based FSIC heavily depends on embedding model pretraining, with PictSure demonstrating superior out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings. In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks. Code can be found at https://github.com/PictSure/pictsure-library.

### [13] [Finding Optimal Kernel Size and Dimension in Convolutional Neural Networks An Architecture Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14846)
*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size selection in CNNs, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size in CNNs is often overlooked but impacts performance. BKSEF aims to optimize it systematically.

Method: BKSEF integrates information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to determine layer-wise kernel sizes.

Result: Experiments show up to 3.1% accuracy gain and 42.8% FLOPs reduction. Case studies confirm real-world applicability.

Conclusion: BKSEF makes kernel size an optimizable parameter, offering practical and theoretical benefits for CNN design.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

*Varun Mannam,Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method automates key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos, reducing costs and improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual video annotation in retail is time-consuming, costly, and prone to inconsistency, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Uses deep neural networks for key-frame identification and object detection tailored to retail environments.

Result: Achieves human-level accuracy, reduces costs by 2x, and requires human verification for less than 5% of frames.

Conclusion: The approach significantly cuts operational costs and time, benefiting retail applications like shopper analysis and security monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications, including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve alignment in T2I models, ensuring generated images reflect user intent while addressing safety and fairness concerns.

Method: DPO-Kernels extend DPO with hybrid loss, kernelized representations (RBF, Polynomial, Wavelet), and divergence selection (Wasserstein, R'enyi). DETONATE benchmark and AQI measure are introduced.

Result: DPO-Kernels show improved alignment and robustness, with DETONATE providing a large-scale evaluation framework. AQI reveals latent-space vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels enhance T2I alignment, and DETONATE serves as a benchmark for future research, with AQI offering a novel evaluation metric.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PeRL is a reinforcement learning approach for enhancing vision-language models in multimodal reasoning, focusing on multi-image positional relationships. It introduces permutation and rollout filtering to improve learning efficiency and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for VLMs struggle with complex multi-image positional reasoning, limiting real-world applicability. PeRL aims to address this gap.

Method: PeRL uses image sequence permutation for spatial diversity and a rollout filtering mechanism to focus on optimal trajectories.

Result: PeRL outperforms R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines on multi-image benchmarks while maintaining performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: PeRL advances multimodal reasoning by effectively handling multi-image positional relationships, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.

### [18] [Frequency-Calibrated Membership Inference Attacks on Medical Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14919)
*Xinkai Zhao,Yuta Tokuoka,Junichiro Iwasawa,Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on medical image diffusion models, addressing challenges like inherent image difficulty and high-frequency detail reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in medical imaging due to diffusion models prompted the need for accurate MIAs to quantify risks. Existing methods fail due to reconstruction error biases.

Method: FCRE focuses on mid-frequency reconstruction errors, excluding high and low frequencies, and uses structural similarity scores for membership determination.

Result: Experiments show FCRE outperforms existing MIA methods on medical image datasets.

Conclusion: FCRE effectively mitigates biases in reconstruction errors, improving MIA accuracy for medical diffusion models.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quark-gluon jet discrimination is crucial for high-energy physics, but ViT architectures remain underexplored for calorimeter image analysis under realistic conditions.

Method: Uses simulated 2012 CMS Open Data to construct multi-channel jet-view images from energy deposits and tracks, evaluating ViT and hybrid models.

Result: ViT-based models, especially hybrids like ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt, outperform CNNs in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The study establishes a framework for ViT applications in jet classification and provides a dataset for future deep learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two models (LRCNs and Transformer-based) using RGB tactile images from GelSight to improve compliance prediction accuracy, outperforming baselines and identifying challenges with harder objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection lacks portability and scalability, while existing neural network methods suffer from accuracy issues.

Method: Two models (LRCNs and Transformer) using RGB tactile images from GelSight for compliance prediction.

Result: Models show significant performance improvement over baselines; harder objects are more challenging to estimate.

Conclusion: The proposed models effectively improve compliance estimation, though harder objects remain a challenge.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering, agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

TL;DR: PALETTE is an end-to-end text spotter for historical maps, using hyper-local sampling and positional embeddings to improve text detection and recognition. It includes SynthMap+ for synthetic training data and outperforms SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps contain valuable georeferenced text, but extraction is challenging due to lack of methods and training data. Existing approaches are limited to specific map styles.

Method: PALETTE introduces hyper-local sampling for precise feature extraction and hyper-local positional embeddings for spatial interactions. SynthMap+ generates synthetic training data.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on historical map benchmarks, especially for long and angled text. It processed 60,000+ maps and generated 100M+ labels.

Conclusion: PALETTE effectively addresses text extraction challenges in historical maps, enabling large-scale processing and supporting map searching.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer is a unified framework for style transfer, addressing traditional issues and enabling artist-level results. It uses semantic-based style injection, data augmentation with human feedback, and a training-free triple diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional style transfer methods and unify frameworks for diverse tasks, enabling high-quality, artist-level style transfer and text-driven stylization.

Method: 1. Semantic-based style injection using BLIP and CLIP. 2. Data augmentation with human feedback. 3. Training-free triple diffusion process for feature manipulation.

Result: Achieves high-quality style transfer, text-driven stylization, and image color editing while preserving original content.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer revolutionizes style transfer with a unified, efficient framework, delivering artist-level results and novel capabilities like color editing.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions in vector quantization, addressing training instability and codebook collapse, achieving near 100% codebook utilization and reduced quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods suffer from training instability and codebook collapse due to mismatched distributions of features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and data loss.

Method: The authors employ the Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors, ensuring better representation and utilization.

Result: The approach achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduces quantization error, validated empirically and theoretically.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates training instability and codebook collapse, improving the performance of autoregressive models.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: SynPo improves few-shot medical image segmentation by enhancing negative prompts in LVMs like SAM, using a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module and outperforming training-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods using LVMs for medical image segmentation underperform due to ineffective use of negative prompts, especially in low-contrast images.

Method: SynPo combines DINOv2 and SAM to create a reliable confidence map, selects top-k positive and Gaussian-distributed negative points, clusters them, and uses these as high-quality prompts for SAM.

Result: SynPo matches the performance of state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods in experiments.

Conclusion: SynPo effectively addresses the limitations of training-free LVMs by improving negative prompt quality, achieving competitive results without training.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

*Jiaqi Shi,Jin Xiao,Xiaoguang Hu,Boyang Song,Hao Jiang,Tianyou Chen,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Point Distribution Set Abstraction (PDSA) module to improve point cloud analysis by correcting feature distribution in high-dimensional space, enhancing efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aggregating local structures in point clouds suffer from irrelevant point interference, feature hierarchy gaps, high computational overhead, and noise sensitivity.

Method: PDSA uses high-dimensional correlations and a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor to refine feature distribution, reduce neighbor feature matrix variance, and improve class separability. A key point mechanism optimizes computation.

Result: Experiments on semantic segmentation and classification tasks show significant performance improvements with fewer parameters, validating PDSA's generalization and effectiveness.

Conclusion: PDSA addresses key limitations in point cloud analysis, offering a robust, efficient solution with demonstrated performance gains.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data. While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

TL;DR: Echo-DND, a dual-noise diffusion model, improves left ventricle segmentation in noisy echocardiograms by combining Gaussian and Bernoulli noises with multi-scale fusion and spatial coherence calibration, outperforming SOTA models with Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LV segmentation in noisy, low-contrast echocardiograms is critical for diagnostics but challenging due to ambiguous boundaries.

Method: Echo-DND uses Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, multi-scale fusion conditioning, and spatial coherence calibration.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.962 (CAMUS) and 0.939 (EchoNet-Dynamic), outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: Echo-DND sets a new standard for echocardiogram segmentation and shows potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments. However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision. Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively. The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across various medical domains.

TL;DR: ReSeDis unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding for visual search, addressing both retrieval and localization in one task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on retrieval or localization but not both, limiting practical applications in large-scale visual search.

Method: Introduces the ReSeDis task, which combines retrieval and grounding, and provides a benchmark with unique object-description mappings.

Result: A zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model shows potential but leaves room for improvement.

Conclusion: ReSeDis serves as a realistic testbed for advancing multimodal search systems by addressing both retrieval and localization challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the promise of VICL for OCT, encourages further research, and releases code to support practical adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast, generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and practical adoption, we openly release our code.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), a method to protect images from exploitation by vision-language models while maintaining compression functionality. It uses a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation module and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented optimization for flexible decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard user privacy by preventing vision-language models from exploiting publicly posted images, while retaining image compression utility.

Method: Introduces PSIC, which generates bitstreams with multiple decoding options. Uses CLTG for customizable decoding and UAEO optimization for leveraging VLP model uncertainty. Includes adaptive multi-objective optimization for balanced performance.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in protecting images from VLP model exploitation while preserving perceptual quality and compression functionality.

Conclusion: PSIC is a plug-and-play solution that enhances privacy protection in image compression without compromising utility, adaptable to existing Learned Image Compression models.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP) models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models.

*Dan He,Weisheng Li,Guofen Wang,Yuping Huang,Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) for high-quality multimodal medical image fusion, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods struggle with capturing detailed features and cross-modal interactions, leading to suboptimal fused image quality.

Method: DM-FNet uses a two-stage approach: Stage I trains a UNet for image reconstruction via diffusion, and Stage II enhances feature recognition by inputting noisy images into a fusion network with adaptive modules.

Result: The method outperforms others in objective metrics, producing fused images with balanced brightness, color, contrast, and detail.

Conclusion: DM-FNet effectively improves MMIF quality by leveraging diffusion models and adaptive fusion, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Motivation: To enhance video understanding by generating detailed and accurate natural language descriptions of videos with paired audio.

Method: Proposes video-SALMONN 2 with LoRA, optimised via DPO and a novel MrDPO approach, involving periodic updates and ground-truth guidance.

Result: Reduces captioning error rates by 28%, outperforming leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro with just 7B parameters.

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2 sets a new benchmark for video captioning, combining efficiency and accuracy, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Motivation: SAR ship detection struggles with scale variations, noise from small vessels, and complex backgrounds. Current methods lack effective feature representation and fusion.

Method: C-AFBiFPN introduces a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module and integrates BiFormer attention into BiFPN for better feature fusion and global modeling.

Result: Experiments on SSDD show improved detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and multi-scale adaptability.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN effectively addresses SAR ship detection challenges, enhancing feature representation and fusion for better performance.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing. Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges, including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

TL;DR: RA-NeRF improves camera pose estimation for 3D reconstruction by combining NeRF with flow-driven pose regulation and an implicit pose filter, achieving state-of-the-art results on complex trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurate camera pose estimation for complex trajectories, limiting 3D reconstruction quality.

Method: RA-NeRF integrates photometric consistency in NeRF, flow-driven pose regulation, and an implicit pose filter for robust pose prediction.

Result: RA-NeRF outperforms existing methods on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets in pose estimation and visual quality.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF is effective and robust for scene reconstruction under complex camera trajectories.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetroMem introduces a recall-augmented COD architecture with dynamic memory integration, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack historical context, limiting adaptability in complex camouflage scenes.

Method: Two-stage training: learning (DMA for multi-scale info) and recall (DMM and IPR for memory-driven inference).

Result: RetroMem achieves superior performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic memory integration enhances COD by leveraging historical knowledge for better camouflage understanding.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: High demand and competition in semiconductors necessitate efficient defect classification. DA reduces manual effort and costs while improving model adaptability.

Method: Proposes DBACS, a CycleGAN-inspired model with additional loss terms, tested on real-world Electron Microscope images in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

Result: Demonstrates DA's effectiveness in semiconductor defect classification, with DBACS showing improved performance.

Conclusion: The study advances DA techniques for semiconductors, highlighting DBACS's potential for reducing manual effort and enhancing scalability.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based methods fail to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content due to underutilized network features and lack of video-specific design.

Method: Proposes MSNeRV with temporal windows for consistency, GoP-level grids for background, a multi-scale spatial decoder, and a multi-scale feature block for enhanced feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios and shows superior representation capability among INR-based methods.

Conclusion: MSNeRV effectively addresses INR limitations, offering improved video representation and compression efficiency.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Result: BCRNet outperforms existing methods on L3D and P2ILF datasets, showing significant improvements.

Conclusion: BCRNet enhances surgical navigation in laparoscopic liver surgery, with code availability for further use.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on 2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code will be available.

Motivation: Current ME analysis methods treat spotting and recognition separately, which is suboptimal for real-world scenarios. The rise of multimodal models offers new opportunities for improved ME analysis.

Method: The paper proposes two tasks: ME-STR (unified spotting and recognition pipeline) and ME-VQA (using multimodal models for ME-related questions).

Result: The MEGC 2025 challenge will evaluate algorithms on these tasks, with results submitted to a leaderboard.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of multimodal models for advancing ME analysis and invites participation in the MEGC 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenPath is a novel open-set active learning method for pathology image classification that leverages a Vision-Language Model to efficiently select informative and in-distribution samples, reducing labeling costs and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning methods assume a closed-set scenario, but real-world clinical data often includes out-of-distribution samples, reducing annotation efficiency. OpenPath addresses this by improving sample selection purity and informativeness.

Method: OpenPath uses task-specific prompts in the first query to select in-distribution samples and employs Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) in subsequent queries, combining Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS).

Result: Experiments on public pathology datasets show OpenPath significantly improves model performance by ensuring high purity of selected samples and outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Conclusion: OpenPath effectively addresses the challenges of open-set active learning in pathology image classification, offering a practical solution for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Conclusion: CountVid effectively addresses open-world object counting in videos, with the dataset and model made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: Existing re-identification methods struggle with geometric distortions in animal fur/skin patterns due to movement and posture changes.

Method: Proposes a geometry-aware texture mapping approach using surface normal estimation to unwarp pelage patterns into UV space, preserving geometric consistency.

Result: Achieves up to 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy for Saimaa seals and leopards.

Conclusion: The method enhances robustness in feature matching across diverse poses and viewing angles, requiring no ground truth UV annotations.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.

TL;DR: DDIS introduces a Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method using a text-to-image diffusion model as a prior, improving synthetic image quality by aligning domains and optimizing class-specific attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFIS methods produce samples deviating from training data due to lack of natural image priors. DDIS addresses this by leveraging diffusion models for better alignment.

Method: DDIS uses Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) and optimizes a Class Alignment Token (CAT) to align synthetic data with training data distribution.

Result: DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods on PACS and ImageNet, generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution.

Conclusion: DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance in data-free image synthesis by effectively leveraging diffusion models and domain alignment.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications, but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in data-free applications.

Motivation: Reliability in deep learning for medical imaging is critical, especially for identifying OOD samples that may indicate anomalies. Existing methods may not fully capture OOD diversity.

Method: NERO clusters neuron-level relevance for ID classes to form centroids and uses a relevance distance metric for OOD detection. It also incorporates scaled relevance in the bias term and feature norms.

Result: NERO outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks (Kvasir and GastroVision).

Conclusion: NERO enhances OOD detection in medical imaging, offering improved reliability and explainability.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of limited large-scale 4D HOI datasets motivates the development of GenHOI to generalize to unseen objects and synthesize high-quality 4D sequences.

Method: GenHOI uses Object-AnchorNet for sparse 3D HOI keyframe reconstruction and Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) for dense 4D sequence interpolation, incorporating contact-aware components.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, showcasing generalization to unseen objects and high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: GenHOI effectively addresses the lack of 4D HOI datasets, achieving strong generalization and high-quality synthesis through its two-stage framework.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models. Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

TL;DR: CLAIM is a framework for generating realistic and diverse myocardial scar images from LGE cardiac MRI, using clinical knowledge to guide synthesis and segmentation, improving accuracy and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability and variability of high-quality labeled LGE images hinder robust scar segmentation model development.

Method: CLAIM uses the SMILE module (clinical knowledge-guided scar mask generation) and a diffusion-based generator to synthesize anatomically consistent scars. It also employs joint training of the generator and segmentation network.

Result: CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scars and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions than baselines.

Conclusion: CLAIM enables controllable, realistic scar synthesis and improves downstream medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this, we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE \textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

### [51] [RaCalNet: Radar Calibration Network for Sparse-Supervised Metric Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15560)
*Xingrui Qin,Wentao Zhao,Chuan Cao,Yihe Niu,Houcheng Jiang,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet eliminates dense LiDAR supervision for radar-based depth estimation, using sparse LiDAR to achieve comparable or better results with only 1% supervision density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dense metric depth estimation using radar rely on costly and data-intensive dense LiDAR supervision. RaCalNet aims to reduce this dependency.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates sparse radar points to create accurate depth priors, which guide monocular depth prediction without dense supervision.

Result: RaCalNet outperforms dense-supervised methods, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89% on datasets, while preserving fine details.

Conclusion: RaCalNet demonstrates that sparse supervision can achieve superior depth estimation, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to dense-supervised methods.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WinWinLay is a training-free method for Layout-to-Image generation, improving control precision and realism via Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-Image diffusion models struggle with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts in Layout-to-Image generation.

Method: Proposes Non-local Attention Energy Function to redistribute attention scores and Adaptive Update (Langevin dynamics-based) to maintain in-domain updates.

Result: WinWinLay outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precise element placement and photorealistic fidelity.

Conclusion: WinWinLay effectively addresses localization and artifact issues, enhancing Layout-to-Image generation without additional training.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in fine-grained land cover analysis due to high annotation costs, scale variation, and limited adaptability of large-scale models.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m imagery, integrating SAM2 knowledge and a FreqWeaver Adapter for detail modeling.

Result: Achieves 1.78% and 3.44% improvements over existing methods in parameter efficiency and segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in ultra-high-resolution classification with robust results and minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on 1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery, which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

TL;DR: A novel graph-based framework for end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction improves large-scale AGB estimation, reducing reliance on high-quality TLS data and pre-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QSM methods for AGB estimation are limited by their focus on individual trees, dependence on TLS, and cumbersome pre-processing, hindering scalability.

Method: The study introduces a unified graph-based pipeline integrating tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction through topology reasoning.

Result: The framework performs well in leaf-on (~20% error) and low-density ULS (~30% error) scenarios, proving robust and scalable.

Conclusion: This method advances QSM-based AGB estimation, enabling operational-scale applications and validating ULS as a viable alternative to TLS.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DLoRAL, a Dual LoRA Learning paradigm for Real-VSR, combining temporal consistency and spatial detail enhancement using stable diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often sacrifice spatial details for temporal coherence, leading to suboptimal results. The goal is to balance both aspects effectively.

Method: Proposes a two-phase approach: (1) Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) and Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) for temporal consistency, and (2) Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) for spatial detail enhancement, iteratively optimized.

Result: DLoRAL achieves high-quality video restoration with strong performance in accuracy and speed, demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances temporal consistency and spatial detail enhancement, offering efficient and realistic video super-resolution in one diffusion step.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

TL;DR: M2M-Reg is a novel framework for multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) that uses mono-modal similarity metrics, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x in DSC for PET-MRI and FA-MRI alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DIR methods struggle with highly heterogeneous modalities due to unreliable similarity metrics, leading to distorted images.

Method: Proposes M2M-Reg, a framework using mono-modal similarity, and GradCyCon, a regularizer for diffeomorphism. Extends to semi-supervised learning without ground-truth transformations.

Result: Achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods on the ADNI dataset for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg effectively handles heterogeneous multi-modal DIR, offering seamless integration and superior performance.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction-free online framework for open-vocabulary 3D object detection, leveraging pre-trained models and multi-view fusion for real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational overhead and memory constraints of dense point cloud reconstruction in existing 3D detection methods to enable real-time deployment.

Method: Uses Cubify Anything for single-view 3D detection and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics, with multi-view fusion via association and optimization modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets, enabling real-time perception in large environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a memory-efficient, real-time solution with strong generalization for open-vocabulary 3D object detection.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi successfully generates complex, controllable HOIs driven by text prompts, balancing realism and physical correctness.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions, including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

### [60] [FindingDory: A Benchmark to Evaluate Memory in Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15635)
*Karmesh Yadav,Yusuf Ali,Gunshi Gupta,Yarin Gal,Zsolt Kira*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating long-range embodied tasks in robotics, addressing the limitations of current vision-language models in handling long-term memory and fine-grained reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with long-term memory and embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, necessitating a specialized benchmark.

Method: A new benchmark is introduced in the Habitat simulator, featuring 60 memory-intensive tasks. Baselines combine state-of-the-art VLMs with navigation policies for evaluation.

Result: The benchmark enables scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning in embodied agents, highlighting areas for improvement in current models.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for advancing memory integration and reasoning in embodied AI, with potential for further task extensions.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

### [61] [Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645)
*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Higher visual quality doesn't always improve MLLM performance; controlled degradations can paradoxically enhance results. VQ-TTT, a lightweight adaptation module, dynamically adjusts images to align with model preferences, boosting accuracy without extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual input quality affects MLLM performance and address the paradox where degraded images sometimes improve results.

Method: Systematic study with controlled degradations and stylistic shifts on images. Introduces VQ-TTT, a module with a learnable kernel and LoRA fine-tuning for shallow vision-encoder layers.

Result: VQ-TTT improves accuracy across MLLMs and datasets without external models or extra data.

Conclusion: Adaptive visual inputs, not universally clean images, are key for MLLMs, redefining what constitutes 'better' visual data.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViMaR is a two-stage inference framework for VLMs that improves efficiency and output fidelity by combining a value model with margin-aware reward adjustments, achieving faster and more reliable captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time search methods for VLMs are computationally expensive and prone to low-confidence generations, leading to hallucinations.

Method: ViMaR uses a temporal-difference value model and margin-aware reward adjustment in two stages: identifying high-value captions and refining weak segments.

Result: ViMaR generates more reliable, accurate, and detailed captions with a 4× speedup and demonstrates cross-model generalization.

Conclusion: ViMaR is a scalable, transferable decoding strategy that enhances VLM performance and enables self-improving pipelines.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for image/video relighting using joint albedo estimation and relit synthesis via video diffusion models, improving generalization and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of existing relighting methods, such as data scarcity in end-to-end models and error accumulation in two-stage pipelines, to achieve better scene understanding and lighting effects.

Method: Jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass using video diffusion models, trained on synthetic and real-world labeled data.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization across domains, outperforming prior methods in visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses relighting challenges, offering realistic lighting effects and material interactions with broad applicability.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack diversity, duration, and annotations for world exploration, limiting their utility for interactive applications.

Method: The authors introduce Sekai, a dataset with 5,000+ hours of FPV and drone videos from 100+ countries, annotated with location, scene, weather, and more. They also develop a toolbox for collection and annotation.

Result: Experiments confirm the dataset's quality, and a subset is used to train YUME, an interactive video world exploration model.

Conclusion: Sekai is a valuable resource for video generation and world exploration, enabling new applications.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: ECAD uses a genetic algorithm to optimize caching schedules for diffusion models, improving inference speed and quality-latency trade-offs without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are slow and computationally expensive; existing caching methods are rigid and lack generalization.

Method: Proposes ECAD, a genetic algorithm that learns per-model caching schedules using calibration prompts, forming a Pareto frontier.

Result: ECAD achieves significant speedups (e.g., 2.58x on PixArt-alpha) and better quality metrics (e.g., 4.47 FID improvement) compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable, generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion models, adaptable to unseen resolutions and variants.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

*Maxwell J. Jacobson,Corey J. Maley,Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM integrates symbolic reasoning with neural generation for context-sensitive decisions in multi-modal data, outperforming classical logic and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic logic lacks nuance and grounding in multi-modal environments, while neural networks lack interpretable reasoning. CALM bridges this gap.

Method: CALM uses domain trees for predicates, refining analog truth values via neural networks and symbolic reasoning for constraint satisfaction.

Result: CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy in object placement tasks, surpassing classical logic (86.3%) and LLMs (59.4%), and aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: CALM combines logic precision with neural multi-modal processing, paving the way for robust, interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM). CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural networks.

TL;DR: MEAL is the first benchmark for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by enabling GPU-accelerated learning across 100 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for continual learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings are limited by CPU-based computation, hindering research.

Method: MEAL leverages JAX for GPU acceleration, allowing efficient learning across long task sequences.

Result: Naive CL and MARL methods perform well in simple environments but fail in complex settings requiring coordination and adaptation.

Conclusion: MEAL identifies critical architectural and algorithmic features for successful CMARL, advancing research in this underexplored area.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation. Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical for CMARL on MEAL.

TL;DR: T-PPO improves PPO's efficiency for training LLMs by optimizing policy updates and response generation, achieving 2.5x faster training without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's inefficiency in long-response generation due to on-policy nature and low hardware utilization motivates the need for a more efficient method.

Method: Proposes T-PPO with Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) and a mechanism for independent policy and value model optimization.

Result: T-PPO achieves up to 2.5x faster training efficiency on AIME 2024 with a 32B model, outperforming competitors.

Conclusion: T-PPO effectively addresses PPO's inefficiencies, enhancing training speed and performance for reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors.

TL;DR: HeurAgenix is a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework using LLMs to evolve and select heuristics for combinatorial optimization, outperforming existing methods and matching specialized solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic designs for combinatorial optimization rely on manual expertise and lack generalization. HeurAgenix aims to automate and improve this process using LLMs.

Method: HeurAgenix evolves heuristics by comparing seed and high-quality solutions, then dynamically selects the best heuristic for each problem state using LLMs. A dual-reward mechanism fine-tunes the selector for robustness.

Result: HeurAgenix outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matches or exceeds specialized solvers on canonical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating heuristic design and selection for combinatorial optimization, offering flexibility and robustness.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Result: MARL effectively balances imaging and resource management, addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

Conclusion: The findings provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations and guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring, disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising computation demands in maritime IoT and challenges of inefficient offloading and resource allocation due to uncertain tasks.

Method: Proposes a cooperative MEC framework, formulates an optimization problem, uses Lyapunov optimization for uncertainty, and solves it with a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic method.

Result: Simulations confirm the framework's effectiveness in computational offloading and resource allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently addresses maritime IoT computation challenges through UAV-vessel cooperation and advanced optimization techniques.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements. However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. 
By converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. 
Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing computational offloading and resource allocation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods process historical observations simultaneously, ignoring internal causal structures, limiting performance improvements.

Method: Proposes CAN with a Causal Understanding Module to enhance environmental understanding by modeling causality in sequential data.

Result: CAN consistently outperforms baselines in various tasks and environments, with gains attributed to the Causal Understanding Module.

Conclusion: The causal framework and CAN demonstrate superior performance and generalization in navigation tasks without added computational cost.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Method: Characterize state representation methods along three axes: action informativeness, reward informativeness, and prompting style (natural language compression). Apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game.

Result: Summarized history, regret information, and limited action details lead to behavior closer to game theoretic equilibrium and more stable play. Other representations cause deviations or instability.

Conclusion: State representation significantly impacts LLM agent behavior, with specific representations aligning better with equilibrium predictions and stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

*James Weichert,Daniel Dunlap,Mohammed Farghally,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI Policy Module for CS curricula to address gaps in teaching AI ethics and policy, showing improved student awareness and confidence post-module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CS curricula lack preparation for AI practitioners to integrate ethical principles and policy into AI development.

Method: Developed and piloted an AI Policy Module, including a technical assignment on AI regulation, and evaluated student attitudes via surveys.

Result: Students reported increased concern about AI ethics and greater confidence in discussing AI regulation after the module.

Conclusion: The AI Policy Module effectively prepares students to address ethical and policy challenges in AI, with the AI Regulation Assignment being a key tool.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys. Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing ethical challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies overthinking in large reasoning models (LRMs) and proposes two methods to improve efficiency: Efficiency Steering and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, reducing reasoning length without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often generate verbose and redundant content (overthinking), which reduces efficiency and increases costs. The study aims to uncover the origins of this inefficiency and exploit the models' potential for concise reasoning.

Method: 1. Efficiency Steering: A training-free activation steering technique to modulate reasoning behavior. 2. Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL: A reinforcement learning framework that rewards concise correct solutions.

Result: Experiments on seven LRM backbones show significant reduction in reasoning length while maintaining or improving task performance.

Conclusion: Reasoning efficiency in LRMs can be enhanced by leveraging their intrinsic capabilities through self-guided methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work, we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency, revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning. Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

TL;DR: SwarmAgentic is a fully automated framework for generating and optimizing agentic systems, outperforming baselines by 261.8% in tasks like TravelPlanner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack full autonomy, limiting adaptability and scalability. SwarmAgentic addresses this by enabling from-scratch agent generation and self-optimization.

Method: The framework uses language-driven exploration and evolves candidate systems via feedback-guided updates, inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Result: SwarmAgentic outperforms baselines, achieving a +261.8% improvement on the TravelPlanner benchmark, demonstrating effectiveness in unconstrained tasks.

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic bridges swarm intelligence with automated multi-agent generation, advancing scalable and autonomous agentic system design.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Embodied Web Agents, a new AI paradigm integrating physical and digital intelligence, and provides a benchmark for tasks requiring such integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are siloed, limiting their ability to solve tasks requiring both physical and digital intelligence. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Develops a unified simulation platform (Embodied Web Agents task environments) integrating 3D environments with web interfaces, and creates a benchmark for diverse tasks.

Result: Reveals performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI and humans, highlighting challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for AI agents that combine embodiment and web-scale reasoning, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from elderly patients' discharge summaries is presented, addressing underrepresented populations and complex annotation challenges. Transformer models perform well on coarse-grained tasks but struggle with fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical NLP resources and tackle challenges like discontinuous and overlapping entities in AE extraction.

Method: A manually annotated dataset of 14 clinically significant AEs with contextual attributes is created. Models are evaluated using FlairNLP across three granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation.

Result: Transformer models (e.g., BERT-cased) excel in coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943) but underperform in fine-grained tasks (F1 = 0.675), especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite high-level performance, challenges persist in detecting underrepresented AEs and nuanced clinical language. The dataset, available via DataLoch, serves as a benchmark for future AE extraction research.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [80] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) improves structured NLP tasks by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases, leveraging complementary errors for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use implicit constraints during training, leading to low-quality outputs during constrained decoding. BoostCD addresses this by explicitly combining constrained and unconstrained predictions.

Method: BoostCD involves two phases: Phase 1 generates weak predictions (constrained and unconstrained) from the base model. Phase 2 uses a boosted model to combine these predictions into a final output.

Result: BoostCD, applied to closed information extraction (BoostIE), outperforms prior methods in and out of distribution, reducing common errors.

Conclusion: BoostCD effectively improves structured NLP tasks by exploiting complementary errors from constrained and unconstrained decoding, demonstrating superior performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

TL;DR: CrEst is a weakly supervised framework for assessing context document credibility in LLMs, improving accuracy and F1 scores without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for integrating context in LLMs often ignore document credibility, risking unreliable information propagation.

Method: CrEst uses inter-document agreement to estimate credibility, offering black-box and white-box integration strategies for LLMs.

Result: CrEst outperforms baselines, achieving up to 26.86% accuracy and 3.49% F1 score improvements, even in high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: CrEst effectively enhances LLM performance by addressing context credibility, proving robust and scalable.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDBench, a synthetic dataset for evaluating multi-document reasoning in LLMs, addressing the lack of benchmarks in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for rigorous evaluation benchmarks for multi-document reasoning, given LLMs' expanding capabilities and the high cost of traditional annotation methods.

Method: A novel synthetic generation process using LLM-assisted edits on structured seed knowledge to create document sets and QA examples.

Result: MDBench proves challenging for current LLMs and prompting techniques, even with short documents, and enables targeted analysis of reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique is efficient, adaptable, and effective for evaluating and analyzing multi-document reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores LLMs for diabetes prediction, comparing six LLMs (including open-source and proprietary models) with traditional ML models. Proprietary LLMs, especially GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B, outperform others in few-shot settings, though challenges like prompt sensitivity remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the untapped potential of LLMs for structured numerical data in diabetes prediction, comparing their performance with traditional ML models.

Method: Empirical analysis using the PIDD dataset, evaluating six LLMs (Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-2B, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) and three ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) with zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting. Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Result: Proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma-2-27B) perform best in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B surpasses traditional ML models in F1-score. Performance varies with prompting strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for medical predictions but require prompt engineering and domain-specific fine-tuning. Future work should explore hybrid approaches for healthcare applications.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capability to reconstruct original text from embeddings without altering model weights.

Method: Introduce a memory token optimized through training on fixed sequences; evaluate across languages, token lengths, and model scales.

Result: Successful reconstruction of sequences up to 240 tokens in English and Spanish, including with Llama 3.1 8B.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLMs' potential for memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP and topic modeling to identify social isolation and loneliness in suicide narratives, revealing key predictors like gender, sexual orientation, and marital status.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured data on social isolation and loneliness in suicide reports, the study aims to improve surveillance and prevention efforts.

Method: Employed NLP techniques, topic modeling for lexicon development, and supervised learning classifiers to analyze 300,000 suicides from 2002-2020.

Result: High-quality classifiers (F1: .86, accuracy: .82) identified 1,198 cases of chronic social isolation, with higher odds for men, gay individuals, and divorced persons.

Conclusion: The methods can enhance detection and prevention of social isolation and loneliness, aiding public health efforts.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over 300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR = 3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001). We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up. Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in the United States.

TL;DR: PrefBERT is a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation, outperforming traditional metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore by aligning better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating long-form generation lack coherence, style, or relevance, and are biased by pretraining data.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on diverse long-form response datasets with Likert-rated quality to provide semantic reward feedback for GRPO.

Result: PrefBERT outperforms traditional metrics, aligns well with human preferences, and improves policy model training.

Conclusion: PrefBERT is a reliable and effective solution for evaluating and improving open-ended long-form generation.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding affect the unlearning of factual knowledge in LLMs, finding paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning and highlighting challenges in unlearning from text chunks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for unlearning in LLMs due to privacy, regulations, and harmful content, the study investigates how knowledge encoding during learning impacts unlearning effectiveness.

Method: Empirical investigation of learning-time choices in knowledge encoding and their impact on unlearning factual knowledge.

Result: Paraphrased descriptions enhance unlearning performance, but unlearning from text chunks remains difficult.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding is crucial for reliable post-hoc unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve dialogue discourse parsing by resolving ambiguities and reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linguistic features like omission and idiom in dialogues introduce ambiguities, making discourse relation parsing challenging.

Method: DCM uses clarification type and discourse goal reasoning to resolve ambiguities, while CPO optimizes DCM's clarifications to reduce errors.

Result: Experiments on STAC and Molweni datasets show the approach outperforms SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed DCM and CPO effectively enhance dialogue discourse parsing by addressing ambiguities and optimizing clarifications.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Result: On MIMIC-III, CKD-EHR boosts diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2x inference speedup.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR enhances diagnosis accuracy, efficiency, and resource utilization, offering a practical solution for clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

### [90] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage framework for Open-domain Dialogue (OD) generation, addressing the one-to-many (o2m) property by decomposing it into Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), using a new corpus (o2mDial) and novel evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based dialogue agents ignore the o2m property, which limits response diversity. Explicitly modeling this property can improve diversity and coherence.

Method: Decompose OD into MRG (generating diverse responses) and PS (selecting based on preference). Introduce o2mDial corpus, in-context learning, instruction-tuning, and new metrics for MRG and PS.

Result: The framework enhances response diversity and quality (up to 90% improvement), making smaller LLMs competitive with larger ones.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach effectively captures the o2m property, improving OD performance while maintaining coherence.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok is a Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility by 10% without performance loss, using rule-based pre-tokenization and a branching entropy-based algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient tokenizer for Korean that reduces token fertility (number of tokens) while maintaining model performance.

Method: Uses rule-based pre-tokenization aligned with Korean linguistic structure, a seed vocabulary of linguistic units, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Reduces token fertility by ~10%, improving inference speed by 10% without performance drop in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The linguistically informed approach of Thunder-Tok is effective for creating efficient tokenizers for language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates memory mechanisms in state-space language models, revealing primacy and recency effects through structured recall tasks in the Mamba architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models, using behavioral tools like primacy and recency effects.

Method: Applied structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, analyzing accuracy profiles and identifying three key mechanisms: long-term memory via sparse channels, short-term memory via delta-modulated recurrence, and dynamic memory allocation based on semantic regularity.

Result: Observed a U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at sequence start and end. Validated findings via ablations and perturbations on 1.4B and 7B parameter Mamba models.

Conclusion: The study uncovers distinct mechanisms for memory retention and forgetting in state-space models, highlighting the roles of sparse encoding, recurrence, and semantic modulation.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for SDG-related text classification, comparing proprietary and open-source models, and tests task adaptation techniques like Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Fine-Tuning. Smaller models with optimized prompts can match larger models like GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking SDG progress is challenging due to data complexity; automated text classification using LLMs can help.

Method: Analyzed proprietary and open-source LLMs for SDG text classification, tested Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Fine-Tuning techniques.

Result: Smaller models with prompt engineering perform as well as larger models like GPT.

Conclusion: Optimized smaller LLMs can effectively classify SDG-related texts, reducing reliance on larger models.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning enhances LLMs' reasoning by using abstract prototypes, improving performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve cross-domain generalization in Large Reasoning Models by leveraging shared abstract reasoning prototypes.

Method: Proposes ProtoReasoning, a framework with automated prototype construction, verification, and scalability for reasoning tasks.

Result: Achieves 4.7% to 6.3% improvements in reasoning tasks and validates enhanced generalization via prototype learning.

Conclusion: Reasoning prototypes are foundational for generalizable reasoning in LLMs, as confirmed by empirical results.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval is a novel method for evaluating open-ended QA by distinguishing factoid and non-factoid questions, using adaptive scoring and ranking strategies for better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics struggle with semantic similarity and interpretability in open-ended QA, especially for diverse question types.

Method: MinosEval classifies questions as factoid or non-factoid, applying key-point scoring for factoid and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid questions.

Result: Experiments show MinosEval aligns better with human annotations and provides more interpretable results.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses limitations of current evaluation methods, improving accuracy and interpretability for open-ended QA.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates language technologies' ability to understand Basque and Spanish varieties, revealing performance drops due to linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well current language technologies handle linguistic variation in Basque and Spanish, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Method: Uses a novel parallel dataset for NLI, tests crosslingual and in-context learning with encoder-only and decoder-based LLMs, and conducts error and ablation analyses.

Result: Performance drops with linguistic variation, particularly in Basque, due to the variation itself, not lexical overlap. Encoder-only models struggle most with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Linguistic variation, especially in peripheral dialects like Western Basque, challenges current models, highlighting the need for better handling of such variations.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

Motivation: To address domain knowledge gaps in large language models for historical text analysis, reducing labor costs and improving accuracy in computational humanities.

Method: Proposes Graph RAG, integrating knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, and evaluates it on domain-specific (Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B) and open-domain (DeepSeek) models.

Result: Achieves F1=0.68 in relation extraction with Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B; DeepSeek with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on C-CLUE, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Graph RAG provides a low-resource solution for historical knowledge extraction, advancing humanities research and knowledge services.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction, reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B, with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12), effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Motivation: To enhance answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness in large-scale QA by leveraging clustering and multi-stage prompt aggregation.

Method: Hybrid retrieval (sparse/dense indices), K-Means clustering, cluster-specific prompts for LLM, intermediate answer filtering/reranking, and synthesis.

Result: Ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation improve large-scale RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model (LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence. Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation in large-scale RAG systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Thunder-DeID, a framework for de-identifying court judgments in South Korea, addressing legal and technical challenges with a DNN-based pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current de-identification processes are inadequate for large-scale court judgments, and legal definitions of personal identifiers are vague.

Method: The authors (i) create a Korean legal dataset with annotated judgments, (ii) categorize PII systematically, and (iii) develop a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID effectively balances open justice and data protection, offering a scalable and legally compliant solution.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' success in general NLP tasks, their use in critical domains like clinical trial recruitment is limited. The paper aims to explore and contextualize LLM-based solutions for trial-patient matching.

Method: The survey analyzes existing benchmarks, approaches, and evaluation frameworks for LLM-assisted trial-patient matching, identifying gaps and challenges.

Result: LLMs show promise for trial-patient matching due to their knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities, but current methods rely on proprietary models and inadequate benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper calls for better benchmarks and open models to fully leverage LLMs in clinical trial recruitment, while outlining future research directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

TL;DR: DeVisE is a framework for evaluating clinical LLMs by testing their sensitivity to demographic and vital sign changes in ICU notes, revealing differences in reasoning between zero-shot and fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs in clinical decision support lack granularity in assessing genuine medical reasoning, necessitating a framework like DeVisE.

Method: DeVisE uses a dataset of ICU discharge notes (real-world and synthetic) with controlled counterfactuals to evaluate LLMs via input-level sensitivity and downstream reasoning.

Result: Zero-shot models show coherent counterfactual reasoning, while fine-tuned models are stable but less responsive to clinical changes. Demographic factors subtly influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing like DeVisE exposes LLM reasoning strategies, aiding the development of fairer and more transparent medical AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: To assess and improve language models' comprehension of local socio-cultural contexts, particularly India's rich cultural diversity.

Method: Creation of SANSKRITI, a dataset with 21,853 question-answer pairs covering 16 cultural attributes across India's 28 states and 8 union territories.

Result: Evaluation of LLMs, ILMs, and SLMs showed significant disparities in handling region-specific cultural queries.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI provides a comprehensive standard for enhancing cultural understanding in language models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity. Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research in Indian languages for comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization.

Method: Introduces COSMMIC dataset with article-image pairs and comments, explores summarization in four configurations, and uses IndicBERT and CLIP-based classifiers for noise filtering and insights extraction.

Result: The dataset uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback, advancing NLP research and inclusivity in Indian languages.

Conclusion: COSMMIC bridges gaps in Indian language resources, offering a holistic approach for multimodal and multilingual summarization.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Zhicheng Yang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate and improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI agents, addressing hallucinations and localization errors with new metrics and techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often suffer from systematic localization errors (hallucinations) that reduce reliability, necessitating better evaluation and improvement methods.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained evaluation framework, the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) for uncertainty quantification, and Context-Aware Cropping for performance enhancement.

Result: The framework and methods reveal nuanced failure modes, improve interpretability, and enhance robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions provide actionable insights and significantly improve the reliability and performance of MLLMs in GUI interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 offers an efficient, general-purpose solution for LLM multi-agent systems, excelling in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE introduces a framework to assess LLMs' reasoning hierarchy (associations, interventions, counterfactuals) and generates problem variations to test true reasoning vs. memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether LLMs' high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks stems from true reasoning or statistical recall of training data.

Method: Uses RE-IMAGINE, a framework with an automated pipeline to create problem variations at different reasoning levels (symbolic representation) across domains (math, code, logic).

Result: Performance drops when LLMs face problem variations, suggesting reliance on memorization.

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE reveals LLMs' limitations in true reasoning, encouraging further research to improve hierarchical reasoning skills.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: CINGS is a post-training supervision method that improves grounding in LLMs by training them with relevant context prepended to responses, masking the context during loss computation. It enhances grounding in text and visual domains without degrading general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often require external knowledge to reduce hallucinations, but simply appending context doesn't ensure grounded generation. CINGS addresses this gap.

Method: CINGS trains models by prepending relevant context to responses and computing loss only over response tokens, masking the context.

Result: CINGS outperforms other methods in 11 text datasets and reduces hallucinations in vision-language tasks while maintaining factual consistency.

Conclusion: CINGS improves grounding by shifting the model's reliance toward external context, enhancing performance without compromising downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

TL;DR: SPARE is a novel framework for efficient, high-quality automated process annotation in LLMs, improving reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for advancing multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Introduces SPARE, a structured framework for single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning steps to reference solutions with explicit reasoning for evaluation.

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance in offline RL fine-tuning and reward model training, achieving competitive results with 2.6x efficiency.

Conclusion: SPARE offers a scalable and efficient solution for process supervision, with public release of code and models for reproducibility.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for hyperbole and metaphor detection, outperforming baselines with significant F1 score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook emotional associations and implicit meanings in hyperbole and metaphor, limiting detection accuracy.

Method: EmoBi combines emotion analysis, domain mapping, and bidirectional dynamic interaction to enhance detection.

Result: EmoBi achieves a 28.1% F1 score increase for hyperbole and 23.1% for metaphor detection over SoTA.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and potential for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection in NLP.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning to improve grounding in LLMs, achieving better performance in answer correctness, citation quality, and refusal handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating grounded and trustworthy responses in LLMs, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios where models often fail to cite correctly or refuse valid evidence.

Method: Uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) for training with verifiable outcome-based rewards, focusing on answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality. Also employs a two-stage training setup and GPT-4 distillation.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models outperform instruction-only variants, especially in unanswerable queries and well-cited responses. Combined GRPO and GPT-4 distillation enhances long-form QA performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for creating more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION improves local-global attention models by integrating linear attention to capture out-of-window tokens, achieving better efficiency-performance tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of local attention ignoring tokens outside the window, enabling efficiency gains in short-context scenarios.

Method: Introduces RATTENTION, combining local attention with a linear attention mechanism to capture out-of-window tokens.

Result: RATTENTION with a 512 window size matches full-attention performance and enhances long-context performance without compromising training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION shifts the Pareto frontier, offering superior efficiency and performance in local-global attention models.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to approximate training data from model weights, improving model performance by selecting high-matching data from public corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data, creating a need to approximate data from weights.

Method: A gradient-based approach selects high-matching data from a public corpus, tested on classification and supervised-finetuning tasks.

Result: Performance improved from 65% to 80% on AG News and reduced perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3 on MSMARCO, nearing expert benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers useful training data from weights, achieving near-original model performance.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task, our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PredGen reduces latency in LLM-based voice chat by generating responses while the user is still speaking, cutting delay by ~2x with minimal added cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latency in LLM-TTS systems degrades user experience, especially on consumer hardware, due to slow first-sentence generation.

Method: Proposes Predictive Generation (PredGen), a speculative decoding framework that generates candidate responses during user speech.

Result: Simulated experiments show ~2x latency reduction with minimal extra computation.

Conclusion: PredGen effectively addresses latency in real-time voice chat applications without significant overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive metrics for evaluating gender inclusivity in LLMs, especially beyond binary distinctions.

Method: Developed GIFI, a multi-level evaluation metric, and applied it to 22 LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities.

Result: Found significant variations in gender inclusivity among LLMs, highlighting biases and the need for improvement.

Conclusion: GIFI provides a critical benchmark for advancing gender fairness in LLMs, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSG, a task for discourse-level text scene graph parsing, addressing limitations of current methods by proposing a dataset (DiscoSG-DS) and a model (DiscoSG-Refiner) that improves performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene graph parsers fail to handle multi-sentence descriptions effectively, missing cross-sentence phenomena like coreference, leading to fragmented graphs and poor downstream task performance.

Method: The authors introduce the DiscoSG task and dataset (DiscoSG-DS), then propose DiscoSG-Refiner, a two-model approach: one drafts a base graph, and another iteratively refines it, reducing computational overhead.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by ~30% over baselines, is 86x faster than GPT-4, and enhances downstream tasks like caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner offers a scalable, efficient solution for discourse-level scene graph parsing, outperforming existing methods while being practical for open-source use.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

TL;DR: WikiMixQA is a new benchmark with 1,000 MCQs for evaluating cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts from Wikipedia. It highlights challenges in long-context, multi-modal reasoning, with proprietary models like GPT-4-o outperforming open-source ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating complex cross-modal reasoning in document understanding, especially for long-context inputs.

Method: Developed WikiMixQA, a benchmark with MCQs based on tables and charts from 4,000 Wikipedia pages. Evaluated 12 vision-language models, including proprietary and open-source ones.

Result: Proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-o) achieved ~70% accuracy with direct context but dropped significantly in retrieval tasks. Open-source models maxed at 27% accuracy.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA is a vital benchmark for advancing document understanding, revealing significant gaps in long-context, multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise for MCQ creation in Portuguese, though improvements in clarity and distractor design are needed.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

### [121] [The Compositional Architecture of Regret in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15617)
*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies regret in Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing methods to identify and analyze regret expressions and their neural representations, addressing key challenges with new metrics and workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding regret in LLMs is crucial for enhancing model reliability and revealing cognitive coding in neural networks.

Method: The study involves identifying regret expressions, analyzing hidden states, and addressing challenges like dataset absence and lack of metrics. Proposed solutions include a regret dataset workflow, S-CDI for optimal layer identification, and RDS/GIC for neuron analysis.

Result: The S-CDI metric identified the optimal regret representation layer, improving probe classification. An M-shaped decoupling pattern was found, and neurons were categorized into regret, non-regret, and dual types.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address key challenges in studying regret in LLMs, providing insights into neural information processing and functional neuron categorization.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-cultural differences in interpreting intensifiers like 'quite' and 'very' between British and American English, attributing them to a mix of literal meaning differences and varying weights on utterance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether cross-cultural misunderstandings stem from literal word meanings or pragmatic factors like politeness and brevity.

Method: Three experiments and a computational cognitive model analyzing how British and American English speakers interpret intensifiers, incorporating recursive reasoning about informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: Differences in intensifier interpretation arise from both literal meaning variations and differing emphasis on utterance cost, not just semantics or politeness norms.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural interpretation differences result from a complex interplay between literal meanings and pragmatic factors, challenging single-factor explanations.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper, we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity, politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization by measuring ordered coverage of concepts. Analysis of 36 LLMs reveals biases in concept order and low diversity, with the best model achieving only 75% ordered coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to follow concept order instructions and generalize compositionally, the authors propose Ordered CommonGen.

Method: They introduce Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark measuring ordered coverage, and analyze 36 LLMs to assess their performance in adhering to specified concept orders.

Result: LLMs show biases in concept order, leading to low-diversity outputs. The best-performing LLM achieved only 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improvements in LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Motivation: To address authorship attribution for Romanian texts using lightweight, interpretable methods.

Method: Evaluated SVM, LR, k-NN, DT, RF, and ANN with character n-gram features on the ROST corpus.

Result: ANN performed best, achieving perfect classification in some runs with 5-gram features.

Conclusion: Lightweight character n-gram approaches can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight, interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods.

TL;DR: CC-Learn, a reinforcement learning framework, improves LLM reasoning consistency by training on cohorts of similar questions using a composite objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with consistent and robust reasoning, prompting the need for methods to enhance reliability.

Method: CC-Learn uses reinforcement learning with a composite objective (cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, rejection penalty) to enforce uniform reasoning patterns.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA show improved accuracy and reasoning stability over baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Privacy leakage in reasoning traces of large models is significant, as they often contain sensitive data, exacerbated by test-time compute approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that reasoning traces are safe and internal, revealing their vulnerability to privacy leaks.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations to assess leakage, focusing on test-time compute approaches like increased reasoning steps.

Result: Increased reasoning steps amplify privacy leakage, creating a tension between utility and privacy.

Conclusion: Safety efforts must address internal reasoning traces, not just final outputs, to mitigate privacy risks.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 21 MT systems for their ability to preserve gender ambiguity in translations, finding most systems fail but some use specific gender-neutral strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages during MT, avoiding misgendering and representational harms.

Method: Assessed 21 MT systems across three translation directions, categorizing observed gender-neutral strategies and examining binary gender stereotypes' impact.

Result: Most systems lacked gender-neutral translations, but a few employed specific strategies depending on the target language.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved gender-inclusive MT, with some promising strategies identified.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English, maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific strategies, depending on the target language.

TL;DR: GenRecal is a distillation framework for VLMs that addresses architectural diversity, enabling efficient knowledge transfer and outperforming large-scale VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large VLMs on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to computational demands, necessitating efficient distillation methods.

Method: GenRecal uses a Recalibrator to align feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs for effective knowledge transfer.

Result: GenRecal improves baseline performances and outperforms large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs in benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal provides a general-purpose solution for distilling knowledge across diverse VLM architectures, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

TL;DR: PhantomHunter is a detector for LLM-generated text from privately-tuned models, outperforming existing methods with 96% F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting text from privately-tuned LLMs, which current detectors struggle with due to performance drops.

Method: Uses a family-aware learning framework to identify shared traits across base models and their derivatives.

Result: Achieves over 96% F1 scores, surpassing 7 baselines and 3 industrial services.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter effectively detects text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs, addressing a critical gap in LLM-generated text detection.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making is complex and influenced by biases and incomplete information. Current LLM usage lacks the dynamic interaction needed for real-world medical practice.

Method: Proposes MedSyn, a framework for multi-step, interactive dialogues between physicians and LLMs, allowing dynamic exchanges and challenge of suggestions.

Result: Open-source LLMs show promise as physician assistants in simulated interactions.

Conclusion: Future work will validate MedSyn's impact on diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes through real physician interactions.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

*Corentin Delacour,M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb,Joao P. Hespanha,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) to improve sampling in constrained Ising problems, eliminating the need to tune penalty strengths and achieving faster mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical implementations of the Ising model often struggle with soft constraints, which either slow down mixing or fail to enforce feasibility. This motivates the need for a better algorithm.

Method: The authors extend parallel tempering (PT) by adding a second dimension of replicas that interpolate penalty strengths, ensuring constraint satisfaction in the final replicas.

Result: 2D-PT improves mixing in constrained replicas and achieves near-ideal mixing in graph sparsification, with significant speedup over conventional PT in sparsified Wishart instances.

Conclusion: 2D-PT is broadly applicable to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines, offering a practical solution to constraint-related challenges.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NetraAI, a dynamical system-based AI framework for stability and interpretability in clinical trials, and compares it with DeepSeek-V3, a large-scale LLM. NetraAI uses contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient subgroups. A two-tier architecture with an LLM Strategist enhances discovery, yielding high-effect-size subpopulations in clinical case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and stable AI in clinical trials, especially for small datasets, by combining dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning.

Method: NetraAI employs contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to embed features in a metric space and identify stable subgroups. An LLM Strategist meta-layer guides discovery by prioritizing variables and injecting domain knowledge.

Result: In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI transformed weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers using few features, uncovering high-effect-size subpopulations.

Conclusion: NetraAI represents a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI for clinical discovery, aligning with emerging paradigms like LeCun's JEPA and prioritizing explainable knowledge.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized "species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.

Motivation: Overcoming challenges in decoding natural language from EEG for open-vocabulary scenarios, where traditional methods fail due to noise and variability.

Method: Proposes ETS, combining EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data for text generation and sentiment classification.

Result: Achieves superior BLEU/Rouge scores for EEG-to-text and 10% F1 score for sentiment classification, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: ETS shows potential for high-performance open-vocabulary EEG-to-text systems across diverse subjects and data sources.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1) open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

*Emre Yilmaz,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transfer learning method using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) is proposed to predict onflow parameters (angle of attack and speed) from surface pressure data, addressing challenges like data distribution changes and task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional direct measurements of onflow parameters face challenges like sensor faults, necessitating a data-driven approach for real-time learning in applications like wind tunnel monitoring and aerodynamic performance analysis.

Method: The method involves training a ConvNet offline, freezing most weights, and retraining selected layers for transfer learning. It's tested on steady CFD data for domain and task adaptation.

Result: The approach effectively adapts to changing data distributions, domain extensions, and task updates, but performs poorly with noisy data.

Conclusion: Transfer learning with ConvNets is a viable solution for predicting onflow parameters, though noise sensitivity remains a limitation.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy data is concluded to be not as effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes PIPE, a method to embed physical info into VLMs for better multimodal time series forecasting, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect visual data in time series, missing key physical info like geospatial context in satellite imagery.

Method: PIPE uses physics-informed positional indexing and variant-frequency encoding to embed physical and sequential info.

Result: PIPE improves forecasting accuracy, e.g., 12% better typhoon intensity prediction, outperforming prior works.

Conclusion: PIPE effectively integrates physical info into VLMs, enhancing multimodal alignment and forecasting performance.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

*Funing Li,Yuan Tian,Ruben Noortwyck,Jifeng Zhou,Liming Kuang,Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning framework using GNN and Transformer is proposed to optimize retrieval in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous items, minimizing tardiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient, high-density storage systems in logistics is growing, but multi-deep AVS/RS face retrieval challenges due to lane blockages. Current homogeneous storage strategies limit flexibility.

Method: A graph-based state representation captures item attributes and warehouse topology. A neural network combines GNN for local item embeddings and Transformer for global priority assignments.

Result: The framework outperforms heuristic methods in minimizing retrieval tardiness and adapts well to diverse warehouse layouts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses retrieval challenges in multi-deep storage systems, offering flexibility and superior performance.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.

TL;DR: AZT1D is a new dataset addressing the lack of detailed T1D patient data, featuring comprehensive metrics like CGM, insulin delivery, and activity modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, detailed T1D datasets limits advancements in AI-driven diabetes management.

Method: AZT1D collects data from 25 T1D patients on AID systems, including CGM, insulin pump data, carbs, and device modes over 6-8 weeks.

Result: The dataset offers granular details like bolus insulin specifics, rarely available in existing datasets.

Conclusion: AZT1D enables diverse AI/ML applications to enhance T1D clinical decision-making and personalized care.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data, carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [138] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP) to address recurring concept drift in time series by retaining and reusing knowledge of past concepts, improving prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift causes forgetting of past patterns, reducing prediction accuracy. Existing methods update parameters but fail to retain or reuse past knowledge effectively.

Method: CEP stores forecasters for different concepts, retrieves the nearest forecaster for a test sample, and evolves new models for new concepts while eliminating outdated knowledge.

Result: CEP effectively retains knowledge of different concepts and significantly improves prediction accuracy in recurring concept drift scenarios.

Conclusion: CEP is a robust solution for handling recurring concept drift, enhancing online forecasting by retaining and utilizing past knowledge.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept. Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the prediction results.

### [139] [Protein Language Model Zero-Shot Fitness Predictions are Improved by Inference-only Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14793)
*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding dropout at inference improves zero-shot protein property prediction without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance zero-shot prediction performance of Protein Language Models (PLMs) like ESM2 without retraining.

Method: Inject dropout layer at inference between featurizer and transformer, averaging outputs like Monte-Carlo dropout.

Result: Improved zero-shot performance on ProteinGym dataset, optimal dropout rate of 0.1.

Conclusion: Dropout at inference boosts PLM performance without additional training.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Assembly-of-Experts' (AoE), a method to efficiently create child models from Mixture-of-Experts parents by interpolating weights, reducing computational costs and preserving functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost (10^13-10^15 FLOPs) for pretraining LLMs motivates the need for efficient methods to leverage existing models.

Method: AoE interpolates individual weight tensors from parent models to create child variants, enabling gradual or sharp trait transitions.

Result: The DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera' model, created without fine-tuning, achieves R1-level intelligence with 40% fewer output tokens and V3 speed.

Conclusion: AoE enables efficient, functional child model generation, demonstrating practical benefits like reduced computational costs and improved reasoning.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed. Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the tradeoff between structured and selective internal representations in intelligent systems, deriving universal limits on generalization and identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how models balance generalization and input identity preservation, given finite semantic resolution.

Method: Derived closed-form expressions for generalization and identification probabilities, extended to noisy and heterogeneous spaces, and validated with minimal ReLU networks and complex models.

Result: Revealed a universal Pareto front for the tradeoff, a sharp collapse in multi-input capacity, and non-monotonic generalization optima, confirmed across model complexities.

Conclusion: Finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental constraint, shaping representational capacity in deep networks and brains.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective -- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve time series forecasting by integrating semantic priors and dynamic temporal encoding while reducing computational complexity compared to Transformers.

Method: Uses Mamba selective state space model, semantic index embeddings from pretrained language models, and spline-based KAN for temporal encoding.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba is a versatile and efficient alternative to Transformer-based models for time series forecasting.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based models in time-series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete optimization methods and their continuous approximations by focusing on discretization error, providing better theoretical tools.

Method: Designs a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation with counter terms to account for discretization error explicitly.

Result: A continuous time model for HB momentum method with controlled discretization error, applied to study implicit regularization in deep learning.

Conclusion: The work offers new insights into the implicit bias of HB and demonstrates practical applications in deep learning, supported by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PARC, a framework to analyze prompt sensitivity in Vision Language Models (VLMs), revealing their instability to prompt variations and identifying robust models like InternVL2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs, like LLMs, are prompt-sensitive, but their sensitivity to prompt variations in the vision domain is understudied. The paper aims to understand this sensitivity and identify robust models.

Method: PARC evaluates prompt sensitivity using plausible variations in language and vision, a novel reliability score, and calibration for cross-dataset analysis.

Result: VLMs show language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, with destructive variations altering expected answers. InternVL2 models are notably robust.

Conclusion: PARC provides insights into VLM prompt sensitivity, linking it to training data, and identifies robust models, with code available for further research.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models, outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting models struggle with frequent zero-demand periods, impacting inventory management in supply chains.

Method: Proposes a Model-Router framework using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers to assign forecasting strategies based on demand patterns.

Result: Experiments on the Favorita dataset show 11.8% accuracy improvement (NWRMSLE) and 4.67x faster inference with the InceptionTime router.

Conclusion: The framework enhances forecasting precision, reducing stockouts and excess inventory, highlighting adaptive AI's role in supply chain optimization.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies, effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning while maintaining scalability and plasticity.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively balances scalability, plasticity, and performance in continual reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like DXA scans are costly and time-consuming, and supervised machine learning requires large datasets, which are hard to obtain in healthcare due to legal and technical challenges.

Method: The study uses a $p$-Laplacian regression model on biomarkers from 3D optical images, comparing it with supervised methods like SVR and Least Squares SVR.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model achieved errors of ~13% (ALM), ~10% (BMD), and ~20% (BFP) with only 10% training data, while supervised methods performed better (~8% for ALM/BMD, ~11% for BFP) with 80% data.

Conclusion: The $p$-Laplacian model is a promising alternative for healthcare applications with limited data, offering competitive performance despite fewer training samples.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases. Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc) obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However, most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM, $\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of $\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with $\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications, particularly in a data-constrained environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing VLMs' limitations in detailed visual reasoning under constrained compute resources.

Method: Training smaller models with GRPO, simplified tool-calling, and a tailored data mix emphasizing visually difficult examples.

Result: Improved performance on VQA tasks due to enhanced visual information from tools.

Conclusion: GRPO and tool integration effectively boost VLM performance in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying MLLMs in real-world scenarios is challenging due to distributed data and privacy constraints. Federated Learning (FL) is a potential solution, but existing FL methods are impractical for large-scale MLLMs due to high computational and communication demands.

Method: FedNano centralizes the LLM on the server and introduces NanoEdge, a lightweight client module with modality-specific encoders, connectors, and NanoAdapters using low-rank adaptation. This avoids deploying the full LLM on clients, reducing storage and communication overhead.

Result: FedNano reduces client-side storage by 95% and communication overhead to 0.01% of model parameters. It outperforms prior FL baselines, handling heterogeneous data and resource constraints while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: FedNano bridges the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems with practical deployment in privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

Motivation: To accelerate HEA discovery by integrating computational and experimental data, addressing challenges like heteroscedastic and incomplete data.

Method: Systematic comparison of cGP, DGP, encoder-decoder neural networks, and XGBoost on a hybrid dataset for predicting correlated material properties.

Result: DGP outperforms others in capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty, enhancing predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Advanced surrogate models like DGP are robust tools for efficient materials design, especially with complex data.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations. This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics. Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.

Result: Achieves 92.70% training and 92.44% test accuracy, with 0.94 AUC, demonstrating strong generalization and binary classification performance.

Conclusion: The model offers a practical solution for SSD health prediction, reducing data loss risks and optimizing maintenance costs in industrial storage systems.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%, demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud computing data centers and edge storage environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, and ML models lack transparency, hindering performance and trust. Early AMD diagnosis is critical due to irreversible progression.

Method: Introduced CACTUS, a tool combining retinal images and patient data (genetic, dietary, clinical, demographic) for AMD classification, focusing on explainability and bias reduction.

Result: CACTUS outperforms standard ML models, identifies key factors, and provides confidence in results, aligning with medical knowledge.

Conclusion: CACTUS enhances decision-making in AMD diagnosis by improving transparency and reducing bias, offering a practical tool for clinicians.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

### [154] [Generalized Reference Kernel With Negative Samples For Support Vector One-class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14895)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GRKneg for OC-SVM, improving kernel with negative samples without labels, outperforming standard OC-SVM and binary SVM with few negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address small-scale one-class classification with limited negative samples, enhancing OC-SVM performance.

Method: Introduces GRKneg, improving kernel using negative data without label-based optimization, and compares with OC-SVM and binary SVM.

Result: GRKneg outperforms standard OC-SVM and binary SVM with few negative samples.

Conclusion: GRKneg is effective for one-class classification with limited negative samples, bridging the gap between OC-SVM and binary SVM.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms the binary SVM.

*Ganyu Wang,Boyu Wang,Bin Gu,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an event-driven online Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) framework to address challenges like asynchronous data streaming and non-stationary environments, improving stability and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning in VFL faces challenges due to asynchronous data streaming and non-intersecting feature sets, which prior research overlooked.

Method: Proposed an event-driven online VFL framework where only a subset of clients are activated per event, and introduced dynamic local regret (DLR) for non-convex models.

Result: The framework outperformed existing methods in stability under non-stationary conditions and reduced communication and computation costs.

Conclusion: The event-driven approach effectively addresses online VFL challenges, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL, where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication and computation costs.

*Ganyu Wang,Jinjie Fang,Maxwell J. Ying,Bin Gu,Xi Chen,Boyu Wang,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOne framework optimizes query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning by activating one client per round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated black-box prompt tuning methods ignore the high query costs of cloud-based LLMs.

Method: Proposed FedOne, a federated learning strategy activating one client per round for optimal query efficiency.

Result: FedOne significantly improves query efficiency, aligning with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: FedOne is an effective solution for query-efficient federated black-box prompt learning.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne}, enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning algorithms to automatically define the threshold for anomaly detection in Autoencoders, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection systems using Autoencoders face challenges due to nonstandardized separation thresholds, impacting detection performance.

Method: Evaluated three machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, Support Vector Machine) to automatically define the threshold.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the goal is improved anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: Automating threshold definition with machine learning can enhance the effectiveness of Autoencoder-based anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and analyzes special channels in neural network loss landscapes where loss decreases slowly, weights diverge to infinity, and neurons form gated linear units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure and behavior of quasi-flat regions in neural network loss landscapes and their impact on optimization and model performance.

Method: Characterization of channels in the loss landscape where weights diverge and neurons form gated linear units, using gradient dynamics and geometric analysis.

Result: Gradient flow and optimization methods often reach these channels, which appear as flat minima but lead to gated linear units, revealing unexpected computational capabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the loss landscape's quasi-flat regions and highlights the emergence of gated linear units as a key feature of fully connected layers.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_iσ(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_jσ(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow σ(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) σ'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains and explore RL's broader applicability beyond math and code.

Method: Developed Guru, a corpus of 92K verifiable examples across six domains, using domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering. Evaluated RL's impact on pretrained models and trained Guru-7B and Guru-32B.

Result: RL's effectiveness varies by domain: domains with pretraining exposure (Math, Code, Science) benefit from cross-domain RL, while others (Logic, Simulation, Tabular) require in-domain training. Guru models outperform baselines by 7.9% and 6.7%.

Conclusion: RL can facilitate genuine skill acquisition in LLMs, especially for underrepresented domains. Guru models and resources are released to advance general-purpose reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

### [160] [ODD: Overlap-aware Estimation of Model Performance under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14978)
*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) to improve error estimation of ML models in unseen test domains by focusing on non-overlapping regions, outperforming prior DIS² methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods like DIS² estimate model error under distribution shifts but compete in overlapping regions, potentially limiting accuracy. The paper aims to address this by focusing on non-overlapping target domains.

Method: Proposes ODD, which maximizes disagreement only in non-overlapping target domains, avoiding competition in overlapping regions. Uses domain-classifiers to estimate overlap.

Result: ODD-based bounds outperform DIS² in predicting target performance, validated across multiple benchmarks with improved accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: ODD provides a more reliable and accurate error estimation method for ML models in unseen domains by leveraging domain-overlap awareness, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD). Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper predicts MS disability progression using sparse clinical and digital data, showing improved accuracy with multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early MS disability prediction is difficult due to disease heterogeneity, prompting the use of advanced models to integrate diverse data types.

Method: Used tabular/time-series foundation models, a custom multimodal transformer, and machine learning to analyze baseline clinical and 12-week digital data.

Result: Transformer models with digital data outperformed clinical-only models, with multimodal approaches showing consistent advantages.

Conclusion: Foundation models and multimodal methods enhance predictive accuracy for MS, potentially extending to other complex diseases.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fair outcomes across agents while maximizing system performance, addressing challenges of limited reward information.

Method: Introduces a probing framework for information gathering, with a greedy algorithm for offline settings and a sublinear regret algorithm for online settings.

Result: Outperforms baselines in fairness and efficiency, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances fairness and performance, with strong empirical results.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stable CDE state representations improve RL for sepsis treatment by ensuring training stability and acuity-aware regularization, outperforming unstable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address training instability in sequential representations for sepsis treatment RL, which harms policy performance.

Method: Use Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) with early stopping/stabilization and acuity-aware regularization (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS).

Result: Stable CDE representations correlate with clinical scores and enable superior RL policies (WIS return > 0.9), while unstable ones fail (~0).

Conclusion: Training stability and acuity-aware regularization are critical for effective CDE-based representation learning in clinical RL.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim,Sumiran Singh Thakur,Su Min Park,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT-GO introduces a novel supervised fine-tuning method for LLMs by grouping tokens based on importance and optimizing with weighted loss, improving performance over uniform SFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT methods treat all tokens uniformly, ignoring varying importance, which limits task-specific alignment.

Method: SFT-GO groups tokens by importance, using a weighted combination of worst-group loss and cross-entropy loss for optimization.

Result: SFT-GO outperforms baselines across benchmarks, datasets, and base models, showing robustness.

Conclusion: SFT-GO effectively improves LLM fine-tuning by focusing on critical tokens, enhancing performance and learning dynamics.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of vocabulary size on training dynamics in large language models, revealing a new regime (LV) with different scaling rules than $μP$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unrealistic assumption in $μP$ theory that input dimension (vocabulary size) is fixed, and to understand its effect on training dynamics.

Method: Theoretical analysis of training dynamics with varying vocabulary sizes, followed by experiments including pretraining a 1B model.

Result: Vocabulary size interpolates between $μP$ and LV regimes, with LV requiring a $Θ(√width)$ embedding LR to hidden LR ratio.

Conclusion: The LV regime's scaling rules differ from $μP$ and align better with empirical observations, improving model pretraining efficiency.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $μ$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $μ$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \emph{interpolate between the $μ$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $μ$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $Θ(width)$ ratio predicted by $μ$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.

Motivation: Conventional reinforcement learning for hyperparameter optimization is time and resource-intensive, limiting widespread adoption.

Method: SPG extends the base model with temporary modules to generate state-action trajectories in one forward pass, enabling efficient optimization.

Result: SPG improves model performance by +0.2~7% across diverse datasets (ImageNet, COCO, GLUE, SQuAD, SUPERB) with low computational costs.

Conclusion: SPG offers a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating consistent performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3 multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$, with significantly low computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training highly accurate neural networks is challenging due to non-convex optimization and hyperparameter tuning, with traditional methods often neglecting $L^{\infty}$ error.

Method: The framework refines staged training by learning prediction residuals sequentially, optimizing loss functions, parameters, and adaptive data sampling.

Result: Validated on benchmark problems, the framework enhances overall accuracy.

Conclusion: HiPreNets effectively addresses training challenges and improves precision in neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs when used as cognitive cores for embodied agents, especially in long-horizon tasks with scene-task mismatches.

Method: Constructed a hallucination probing set from an existing benchmark, evaluated 12 models in two simulation environments, and analyzed responses to infeasible tasks.

Result: Models showed reasoning but failed to resolve inconsistencies, with hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations in handling infeasible tasks and provides insights for developing more robust planning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model for robust traffic data imputation by combining low-rank tensor algebra and deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data in traffic systems due to sensor failures and sensing gaps hinders reliable modeling, necessitating robust solutions.

Method: NCPF integrates CP decomposition into neural networks via learnable embeddings and uses hierarchical feature fusion with Hadamard products and MLPs for nonlinear refinement.

Result: NCPF outperforms six baselines across six urban traffic datasets.

Conclusion: NCPF unifies interpretable factor analysis with neural networks, offering a flexible solution for traffic data imputation and supporting advanced transportation systems.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.

TL;DR: This paper surveys machine unlearning verification methods, proposing a taxonomy and analyzing strengths, limitations, and open problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of unified taxonomy and systematic evaluation for verifying machine unlearning operations.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing techniques into behavioral and parametric verification, analyzing assumptions and vulnerabilities.

Result: Identifies gaps and vulnerabilities in current verification methods, providing a foundation for future research.

Conclusion: Highlights open problems and calls for more robust and efficient unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance (e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category, analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ImprovDML, a decentralized DML framework, to address Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage while maintaining high model accuracy. Uses resilient vector consensus and Gaussian noise for privacy, offering tighter error bounds and better privacy-accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between Byzantine resilience, privacy preservation, and model accuracy in distributed machine learning.

Method: Leverages resilient vector consensus for aggregation and introduces multivariate Gaussian noise for privacy. Analyzes convergence and privacy using concentrated geo-privacy.

Result: Achieves tighter learning error bounds and better privacy-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods.

Conclusion: ImprovDML effectively balances Byzantine resilience, privacy, and accuracy, validated by theoretical and numerical results.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: SKIL introduces a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework to infer interpretable skill sets and parameterize policies as dynamic mixtures, offering a more realistic model of animal behavior generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify animal behavior by imposing discrete syllables, failing to reflect the dynamic recombination of motor primitives.

Method: SKIL uses representation learning on transition probabilities to infer latent skill sets and parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills.

Result: The method identifies reusable skill components, learns evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond traditional discrete models.

Conclusion: SKIL provides a principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ML techniques for solving the 1D Poisson equation, emphasizing quantitative accuracy and generalization. It identifies critical factors like data function space and proves generalization bounds. Empirical results confirm theoretical findings, revealing inconsistent generalization across model types. A new interpretability method and cross-validation technique are proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between promising ML applications in science and their actual quantitative accuracy, focusing on the 1D Poisson equation as a benchmark.

Method: Quantifies accuracy of ML techniques by analyzing training dynamics, deriving optimal parameters, and proving generalization bounds for white-box and black-box models. Empirical validation includes deep linear models, shallow networks, and physics-specific models.

Result: Generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed; different models show opposing behaviors. A new interpretability method (Green's function extraction) and cross-validation technique are introduced.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for rigorous evaluation of ML in scientific applications, proposing the Poisson equation as a benchmark and offering tools for assessing generalization.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

*Yee Hin Chong,Peng Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoKA is a new PEFT method combining Kronecker-product factorization with SVD-driven initialization and dynamic rank selection, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of large Transformer models is costly; existing PEFT methods have trade-offs like latency, suboptimal convergence, or inflexible rank choices.

Method: SoKA uses Kronecker-product SVD for compact weight updates and dynamic rank selection based on energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria.

Result: SoKA achieves comparable or better performance with 0.99M parameters (25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA) and shows faster convergence and stable gradients.

Conclusion: SoKA is a robust and efficient PEFT strategy for large-scale model adaptation, balancing parameter efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence (randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for large-scale model adaptation.

*Mélanie Cambus,Darya Melnyk,Tijana Milentijević,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of federated learning to Byzantine behavior, revealing a tradeoff between averaging and validity conditions. It provides lower and upper bounds on centroid approximation and introduces a new algorithm for convex validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior and understand the tradeoff between averaging and validity conditions in distributed computing.

Method: The study analyzes validity conditions and centroid approximation, presents lower and upper bounds, and introduces a new algorithm for convex validity. Empirical evaluations in federated learning settings are also conducted.

Result: A lower bound of min{(n-t)/t, √d} on centroid approximation under box validity and an upper bound of 2min{n, √d} are established. A new algorithm achieves √2d-approximation under convex validity.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that validity conditions alone do not ensure good centroid approximation and highlights the impact of Byzantine outliers. The new algorithm tightens existing bounds, and results extend to peer-to-peer settings.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

*Bihe Zhao,Pratyush Maini,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate synthetic held-out data for Dataset Inference (DI), enabling detection of unauthorized training data use without requiring in-distribution private sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DI methods need in-distribution held-out data, which is rarely available, limiting their practicality. The paper aims to overcome this by synthetically generating such data.

Method: The approach involves (1) training a data generator on a suffix-based completion task to create diverse, high-quality synthetic data, and (2) post-hoc calibration to align synthetic and real data likelihoods.

Result: Experiments show the synthetic data enables DI to detect original training sets confidently with low false positives, aiding copyright claims.

Conclusion: The method reliably addresses DI's practical limitations, making it viable for real-world applications like litigation.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability for real-world litigations.

TL;DR: DOVA-PATBM is a geo-computational framework for optimizing EV charging infrastructure, balancing urban, suburban, and rural needs with scalable, data-rich methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable infrastructure planning tools for EV charging networks that address diverse geographic and socio-economic contexts.

Method: Uses a hierarchical H3 grid, graph neural network centrality, Voronoi tessellation, and M/M/c queue modeling to optimize charger placement and sizing.

Result: Increases coverage by 12%, reduces travel distance for low-income residents by half, and ensures power capacity, scalable nationally.

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM bridges academic optimization and practical infrastructure policy, proving effective for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financing challenges for SMEs in CBEC due to limited credit histories, addressed by leveraging 3PL-led SCF with in-transit inventory as collateral.

Method: Combines Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) for risk estimation with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM) to handle complex sales data interactions.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world data, the framework effectively assesses credit risk and determines optimal loan sizes.

Conclusion: Pioneers generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, enhancing credit practices and SME capital access.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

TL;DR: SecFwT is a framework for efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs using MPC, addressing computational overhead and inefficiency in softmax attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to privacy-sensitive domains is challenging due to data scarcity and privacy constraints, with existing MPC methods limited to inference.

Method: SecFwT introduces forward-only tuning and MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to reduce computational overhead and non-linear operations.

Result: Experiments show SecFwT improves efficiency and privacy, enabling scalable LLM fine-tuning for privacy-critical applications.

Conclusion: SecFwT successfully addresses key challenges in MPC-based LLM fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for privacy-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of optimizing molecules for multiple therapeutic targets due to sparse rewards and conflicting constraints.

Method: Combines Seq2Seq VAE with iterative loops to balance chemical diversity, quality, and multi-target affinity, using strategic filters and docking thresholds.

Result: Generated diverse pan-inhibitor candidates for coronavirus proteases, improving exploration of beneficial chemical space.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable approach for navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes efficiently.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.

TL;DR: The paper explores how in-context learning (ICL) works with missing or incorrect labels, showing that multilayer transformers outperform single-layer models by leveraging unlabeled data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why ICL works with imperfect demonstrations and how transformers can exploit unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning.

Method: Theoretical analysis of binary Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with missing labels, comparing single-layer linear attention models to multilayer/looped transformers.

Result: Multilayer transformers implicitly construct estimators that leverage unlabeled data, with performance scaling exponentially with depth. Looping off-the-shelf models improves semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: Depth in transformers is crucial for exploiting unlabeled data, and looping enhances semi-supervised tabular learning performance.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to predict abnormal lab test values using performed tests, treating it as a set translation problem to handle missing data without estimation, improving prediction accuracy by up to 8% AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis is crucial, and predicting abnormal test values from existing results can enhance accessibility. The CBC test is widely used, making it a key focus.

Method: Formulates the problem as a set translation task, using GPT-like embeddings for labels and values, avoiding implicit missing value estimation.

Result: Achieves up to 8% AUC improvement in predicting high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges LLMs with tabular data, improving clinical lab result predictions without handling missing values explicitly.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making. Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods for NNPs increase energy barriers, hindering the creation of training data with high-energy structures, which are crucial for stable MD simulations.

Method: A two-stage training process: first, train the student NNP with data from a non-fine-tuned teacher; then fine-tune with a smaller DFT dataset.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties for organic and inorganic materials while reducing DFT calculations by 10x.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently generates accurate NNPs with fewer expensive DFT calculations, enhancing MD simulation stability and material property evaluation.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.

Motivation: Current diffusion models in FWI struggle with iterative sampling and lack clear methods for incorporating approximate velocity models, hindering their practical application.

Method: The authors propose cI²SB, extending the Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I²SB) to conditional sampling, enabling efficient interpolation between ground truth and smoothed velocity models.

Result: The method outperforms prior conditional diffusion models, achieving high sample fidelity with fewer neural function evaluations (NFEs) and surpassing supervised learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: The cI²SB framework offers a more efficient and effective solution for FWI, addressing key limitations of existing methods while maintaining high-resolution results.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schrödinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge ($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach.

### [186] [Enhancing One-run Privacy Auditing with Quantile Regression-Based Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15349)
*Terrance Liu,Matteo Boglioni,Yiwei Fu,Shengyuan Hu,Pratiksha Thaker,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve one-run DP auditing in black-box settings by using stronger membership inference attacks (MIA), achieving tighter privacy bounds while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-run DP auditing methods in black-box settings show a gap between empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds, prompting the need for improved techniques.

Method: The approach incorporates quantile regression for MIA to enhance auditing in black-box settings, evaluated on DP-SGD-trained CIFAR-10 image classification models.

Result: The proposed method achieves tighter empirical lower bounds on privacy guarantees compared to prior work, without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Using stronger MIA techniques like quantile regression can effectively improve one-run DP auditing in black-box settings, bridging the gap between empirical and theoretical bounds.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

TL;DR: DiTMC adapts Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for molecular conformer generation, addressing challenges like integrating graph data with 3D geometry and handling symmetries, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply DiTs to molecular conformer generation, overcoming challenges like discrete-continuous data integration and symmetry handling.

Method: DiTMC uses a modular architecture with graph-based conditioning and attention mechanisms (non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant).

Result: State-of-the-art precision and physical validity on benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL).

Conclusion: DiTMC's architectural choices and symmetry priors improve sample quality, offering directions for large-scale molecular modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

*Damin Kühn,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to learn global ground metrics for optimal transport, improving accuracy in tasks like embedding, clustering, and classification using only class labels on a distribution-level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predefined metrics lack adaptability to data structure, and supervised approaches often fail to generalize across classes or handle distributions with non-shared supports.

Method: Learns a global ground metric for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space, requiring only class labels on a distribution-level for training.

Result: Enables more accurate optimal transport distances, enhancing performance in embedding, clustering, and classification tasks. Demonstrated effectiveness on scRNA-seq data.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses limitations of existing approaches, offering a flexible and interpretable solution for learning ground metrics in optimal transport.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

TL;DR: A novel framework for exploration using diffusion models, leveraging entropy maximization and density estimation, with a scalable algorithm based on mirror descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generative models to explore novel designs without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification, addressing real-world decision-making challenges like scientific discovery.

Method: Introduces a framework for exploration as entropy maximization over a diffusion model's data manifold, using density estimation and a mirror descent algorithm for scalable fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrates convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model and shows promising empirical results on synthetic and high-dimensional tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages diffusion models for exploration, offering a scalable and theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating promising results.

*Sepehr Elahi,Paula Mürmann,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses minimizing disease extinction time in an SIS model with an unknown graph, proposing a learning algorithm and vaccination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works assume known graphs, but practical scenarios often lack this information, necessitating new methods for graph learning and vaccination.

Method: The approach combines an inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm for graph recovery with optimal and greedy algorithms for vaccination.

Result: The learning algorithm's sample complexity is established, and the vaccination algorithms are proven efficient for bounded treewidth graphs.

Conclusion: Experiments validate the proposed methods, showing effectiveness in learning and vaccination for unknown graphs.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework (VXAI) for evaluating Explainable AI (XAI) methods, addressing the lack of standardized protocols and metrics in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of black-box AI models like Deep Neural Networks undermines trustworthiness, necessitating transparent explanations. Current XAI lacks standardized evaluation methods.

Method: A systematic literature review (PRISMA guidelines) of 362 publications, aggregating metrics into 41 groups, and proposing a three-dimensional categorization scheme.

Result: The VXAI framework offers a structured, comprehensive overview of XAI evaluation, enabling systematic metric selection and method comparability.

Conclusion: VXAI provides a flexible foundation for future XAI evaluation, promoting transparency and trustworthiness in AI systems.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection, promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for future extensions.

Motivation: To systematically review and categorize reward modeling techniques in RL, addressing the lack of a comprehensive survey in current literature.

Method: The survey outlines background, categorizes recent approaches by source, mechanism, and learning paradigm, discusses applications, and reviews evaluation methods.

Result: A comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques, including established and emerging methods, is provided.

Conclusion: The survey fills a gap in literature and highlights promising research directions for reward modeling in RL.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling. Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation of zero-shot RL performance under partial observability, common in real-world applications.

Method: Memory-based architectures are employed to handle partial observability in zero-shot RL, tested in domains with partially observed states, rewards, and dynamics.

Result: Memory-based methods outperform memory-free baselines in partially observable settings.

Conclusion: Memory-based architectures are effective for zero-shot RL in partially observable environments, with open-sourced code available.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via: https://enjeeneer.io/projects/bfms-with-memory/.

*Guoguo Ai,Hezhe Qiao,Hui Yan,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHO introduces adaptive homophily learning for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by capturing diverse homophily patterns in normal nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume uniform homophily in normal nodes, which fails in real-world datasets where homophily varies. RHO addresses this limitation.

Method: RHO uses adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA) to learn and align homophily patterns in node attributes.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show RHO effectively learns diverse homophily and outperforms competing methods.

Conclusion: RHO robustly learns varying homophily in normal nodes, improving anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

TL;DR: A novel technique simplifies warping paths to highlight key transformations (shift, compression, amplitude differences) in time series, improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack qualitative comparison and fail to show broader structural relationships, making it hard to understand shifts or speed changes.

Method: Proposes a technique to simplify warping paths, emphasizing key transformations like shift, compression, and amplitude differences.

Result: The method provides clearer visualization of subsequence matches, enhancing interpretability in time series comparison.

Conclusion: The proposed technique improves understanding of time series relationships by highlighting key transformations.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR techniques lack the ability to explore semantic structures not directly encoded in variables or labels, limiting user-driven analysis.

Method: The framework uses zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and natural-language prompts to dynamically steer projections.

Result: The method improves cluster separation and transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The approach bridges automated DR and human-centered exploration, offering adaptable projections for specific analytical needs.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable, data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

TL;DR: PRISM is a new framework for identifying and scoring polysemantic features in neural networks, improving interpretability by addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature description methods are limited by assumptions of monosemanticity and lack robustness, restricting their ability to fully describe neural network behavior.

Method: Introduces PRISM, a framework that provides nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features, applied to language models.

Result: PRISM outperforms existing methods in description quality and capturing polysemanticity, as shown by benchmarking.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances interpretability by better reflecting the complexity of neural network features, addressing key challenges in automated interpretability research.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIT-LVM improves prediction accuracy for high-dimensional interaction terms in linear predictors by leveraging low-dimensional latent feature representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear predictors with interaction terms often face overfitting in high-dimensional settings, and standard regularizers like lasso and elastic net may not suffice.

Method: LIT-LVM represents features with low-dimensional latent vectors, introducing structured regularization to mitigate overfitting.

Result: LIT-LVM outperforms elastic net and factorization machines, especially with many interaction terms, and provides interpretable latent representations.

Conclusion: LIT-LVM is effective for high-dimensional interaction term estimation and offers additional insights through low-dimensional feature visualization.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

TL;DR: LoX enhances LLM safety robustness by extrapolating low-rank subspaces, reducing attack success rates by 11-54%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of aligned LLMs to safety protection undermining during fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), a training-free method to extrapolate safety subspaces.

Result: Significant robustness improvements against benign/malicious fine-tuning attacks, with 11-54% ASR reduction.

Conclusion: LoX effectively moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, reducing sensitivity to perturbations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a certification framework for pixel-level robustness in post-hoc attribution methods, ensuring reliable explanations despite input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc attribution methods are non-robust to small input perturbations, undermining trust in their explanations. The paper aims to provide rigorous robustness guarantees for these methods.

Method: The framework uses randomized smoothing to sparsify and smooth attribution maps, reformulating the task as a segmentation problem. It certifies pixel importance against ℓ₂-bounded perturbations and proposes three evaluation metrics.

Result: Evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows the certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables reliable use of attribution methods in downstream tasks, addressing their vulnerability to perturbations.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: AutoRule automates rule extraction from human feedback for RLHF, improving model performance and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual rule engineering in RLHF is inefficient; AutoRule aims to automate this process for better scalability and performance.

Method: AutoRule uses a reasoning model to interpret preferences, extracts candidate rules, synthesizes them, and verifies with language models for auxiliary rewards.

Result: AutoRule improves win rates by 28.6% on AlpacaEval2.0 and 6.1% on MT-Bench, with reduced reward hacking.

Conclusion: AutoRule effectively automates rule extraction, enhancing RLHF performance and capturing unique dataset qualities.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets.

*Ivan Marisca,Jacob Bamberger,Cesare Alippi,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes spatiotemporal over-squashing in STGNNs, showing it differs from static GNNs, and reveals counterintuitive propagation biases favoring distant temporal points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored issue of over-squashing in STGNNs, where temporal dimensions exacerbate information propagation challenges.

Method: Formalizes the problem, analyzes convolutional STGNNs, and compares time-and-space vs. time-then-space paradigms.

Result: Convolutional STGNNs favor distant temporal information propagation, and both paradigms are equally affected by over-squashing.

Conclusion: Provides insights for more effective STGNN designs and validates findings on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

### [204] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates dense latents in sparse autoencoders (SAEs), showing they are meaningful and persistent, not just training artifacts. It categorizes their roles and evolution across model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns that dense latents in SAEs are undesirable artifacts, the study aims to systematically analyze their geometry, function, and origin.

Method: The study examines dense latents' properties, introduces a taxonomy for them, and analyzes their evolution across model layers.

Result: Dense latents form antipodal pairs, serve functional roles (e.g., position tracking, semantic features), and evolve from structural to output-oriented signals across layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents are intrinsic to language model computation and should not be dismissed as noise, as they reflect meaningful representations.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

### [205] [RePCS: Diagnosing Data Memorization in LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15513)
*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePCS is a model-agnostic method to detect if retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on memorized data instead of retrieved context, using KL divergence between parametric and retrieval-augmented paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of RAG systems bypassing retrieved evidence and producing contaminated outputs due to memorized training data.

Method: RePCS compares two inference paths (parametric and retrieval-augmented) using KL divergence to measure the impact of retrieved context.

Result: Achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918 on Prompt-WNQA, outperforming prior methods by 6.5 percentage points with minimal latency overhead.

Conclusion: RePCS provides a lightweight, black-box safeguard to ensure RAG systems meaningfully leverage retrieval, crucial for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Jingfeng Wu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplified analysis of SGD in linear regression using basic linear algebra, matching prior results without complex PSD matrix manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the analysis of SGD in linear regression more accessible and facilitate further research on mini-batching and learning rate scheduling.

Method: Uses simple linear algebra tools to derive bias and variance bounds, avoiding complex operator manipulations on PSD matrices.

Result: Recovers the same bias and variance bounds as prior work, demonstrating the effectiveness of the simplified approach.

Conclusion: The simplified analysis enhances accessibility and paves the way for improvements in training realistic models.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools, bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the training of realistic models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Gold's inductive inference framework to include computational observations and restricted input sources, overcoming limitations in learning general recursive functions. It introduces new observation types and shows connections to finite-state transducer inference, but also proves negative results for linear-time computable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional input-output observations in learning general recursive functions by incorporating computational constraints and new observation types.

Method: Extends Gold's framework with Time-Bound and Policy-Trajectory Observations, analyzes learnability under computational constraints, and connects policy-trajectory learning to finite-state transducer inference.

Result: Overcomes learning barriers for general recursive functions with new observations but shows no computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets exist for linear-time computable functions.

Conclusion: The framework enhances learnability of computable functions but reveals inherent limitations for certain classes, linking to broader inference problems.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

TL;DR: The paper identifies gradient pathologies and non-stationarity as root causes of degraded performance in scaling deep reinforcement learning networks. It proposes simple interventions to stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why scaling deep reinforcement learning networks often leads to degraded performance, despite recent complex solutions, and addressing this issue effectively.

Method: Conducts empirical analyses to identify gradient pathologies and non-stationarity as key issues. Proposes simple architectural interventions to stabilize gradient flow.

Result: The proposed interventions stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance across various network depths and widths, validated on multiple agents and environments.

Conclusion: Simple, compatible interventions can effectively address scaling challenges in deep reinforcement learning, providing strong performance even at large scales.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of agents and suites of environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in real-world Wi-Fi fingerprinting due to device heterogeneity and temporal variations, leading to poor generalization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Uses a multi-level variational autoencoder for disentangling domain shifts and a memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism.

Result: Achieves up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DAILOC effectively addresses domain shifts and catastrophic forgetting, improving indoor localization accuracy.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time. Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

### [210] [Towards Explainable Indoor Localization: Interpreting Neural Network Learning on Wi-Fi Fingerprints Using Logic Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15559)
*Danish Gufran,Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogNet is a logic gate-based framework for interpretable and enhanced DL-based indoor localization, improving accuracy, model size, and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL models for indoor localization lack interpretability, hindering understanding of temporal variations and long-term reliability.

Method: LogNet uses logic gates to identify influential APs for each RP and analyze environmental noise impact.

Result: LogNet achieves lower localization error, smaller model size, and reduced latency compared to prior DL models.

Conclusion: LogNet provides interpretability and performance improvements for DL-based indoor localization, ensuring long-term reliability.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient and effective, demonstrating the value of compositional reasoning in AI.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more efficient and sustainable AI framework. We propose a compositional approach by ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence being more efficient.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Tu Nguyen Thi Ngoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci is a self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that uses coding theory and neural modules for efficient mesh smoothing, achieving faster convergence and better results than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of real-time mesh smoothing by overcoming the limitations of classical Ricci-flow solvers (costly global updates) and greedy heuristics (slow convergence or brittle tuning).

Method: MicroRicci combines a greedy syndrome-decoding step (O(E) time) with two tiny neural modules for adaptive vertex and step-size selection.

Result: On 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci reduces iterations (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread, and achieves high UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation (r = -0.93), adding only 0.25 ms per iteration.

Conclusion: MicroRicci's efficiency, automatic adaptation, and high-quality results make it ideal for real-time, resource-limited applications in graphics and simulation.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates, automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE reduces memory overhead in DP training by privatizing gradients after projection, using random Gaussian matrices, and applying projection during backpropagation, achieving comparable utility to DP-SGD with significant memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP methods like DP-Adam incur high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability for large models.

Method: DP-GRAPE introduces three modifications: privatizing gradients after projection, replacing SVD with random Gaussian matrices, and applying projection during backpropagation.

Result: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% for Vision Transformers and 70% for RoBERTa-Large compared to DP-Adam, while maintaining performance. It scales to models like OPT with 6.7B parameters.

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE offers a memory-efficient DP training method with comparable utility to existing approaches, enabling scalability for large models.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFLC, a method to correct biased and noisy labels in ML datasets while ensuring fairness, improving both performance and fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in ML is crucial for trustworthy AI systems, but biased training data undermines fairness and performance.

Method: GFLC combines prediction confidence, graph-based regularization (Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians), and demographic parity incentives.

Result: Experiments show GFLC improves the trade-off between performance and fairness compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GFLC effectively addresses label bias while maintaining fairness, enhancing ML system reliability.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However, the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing. To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) is effective for BrainAGE estimation in stroke patients, outperforming single-site models and showing associations with clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in training BrainAGE models while maintaining accuracy, and to explore associations with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes in stroke patients.

Method: Used FLAIR images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 centers, comparing centralized learning, FL, and single-site learning. Evaluated BrainAGE associations with vascular risk factors and functional outcomes.

Result: FL outperformed single-site models, and BrainAGE was linked to diabetes mellitus and post-stroke recovery.

Conclusion: FL enables accurate BrainAGE predictions without data centralization, with potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the over-conservative policies in offline RL caused by poor explorations in suboptimal data, which affects policy optimization.

Method: Proposes CAWR, incorporating robust loss functions and advantage-based prioritized experience replay to filter poor explorations.

Result: CAWR outperforms on the D4RL benchmark, learning superior policies from suboptimal data.

Conclusion: CAWR effectively addresses over-conservatism in offline RL by handling poor explorations, enhancing policy optimization performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues, such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption, specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance of policy optimization.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the intrinsic and extrinsic structure of self-attention in transformers, showing its invariance to softmax activation and proposing a hierarchical organization method for network 3-tensors. This aids interpretability and practical applications like model pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural properties of self-attention mechanisms in transformers and leverage this for interpretability and network optimization.

Method: Uses paradifferential calculus to prove softmax invariance and hierarchical tensor organization to analyze network structure, supported by computational examples.

Result: Demonstrates invariance in self-attention, hierarchical organization of network tensors, and applications in interpretability and pruning.

Conclusion: The findings advance interpretability and enable practical network optimizations like pruning and architecture comparison.

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers. Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods like the power method often provide loose upper bounds for spectral norm estimation, particularly for matrices with fast-decaying spectra, which are common in deep learning and inverse problems.

Method: The proposed Counterbalance estimator uses matrix-vector products to derive upper bounds on the spectral norm, with probabilistic guarantees against underestimation.

Result: The estimator outperforms the power method, providing significantly tighter upper bounds in synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The Counterbalance estimator is a robust and efficient alternative for spectral norm estimation, particularly beneficial for matrices with fast-decaying spectra.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the spectral norm of a matrix using only matrix-vector products. We propose a new Counterbalance estimator that provides upper bounds on the norm and derive probabilistic guarantees on its underestimation. Compared to standard approaches such as the power method, the proposed estimator produces significantly tighter upper bounds in both synthetic and real-world settings. Our method is especially effective for matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and inverse problems.

### [219] [Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041)
*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-4o's ability to extract economic narratives from news articles, finding it effective but not expert-level, and offers guidance for future LLM use in economics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in deeper semantic understanding for economic narrative extraction beyond traditional NLP pipelines.

Method: Analyzed GPT-4o's performance on extracting economic narratives from Wall Street Journal and New York Times articles, comparing it to expert-annotated gold standards.

Result: GPT-4o extracts valid economic narratives but underperforms experts on complex documents.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o show promise for economic narrative extraction but require further development for expert-level performance; future research directions are suggested.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts. Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives.

*William MacAskill,Fin Moorhouse*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses the rapid advancements in AI and the resulting grand challenges, emphasizing the need for immediate preparation to address these issues rather than delegating them to future AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight the urgent and complex challenges posed by rapid AI-driven technological progress, such as new weapons, AI-enabled autocracies, and ethical dilemmas, which require proactive human action.

Method: The authors analyze potential grand challenges arising from AI acceleration and argue against relying solely on future AI solutions, proposing proactive measures for AGI preparedness.

Result: The paper identifies key challenges and stresses the importance of current human-led efforts to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities from AI advancements.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the necessity of immediate preparation for AI-driven disruptions, advocating for proactive strategies to navigate the unpredictable impacts of an intelligence explosion.

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions, in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies, races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing, now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would bring.

TL;DR: A framework evaluates LLM-simulated vs. human behaviors in surveys, finding misalignment in contentious questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLM alignment with human behavior in social science research.

Method: Hypothesis testing to quantify misalignment in multiple-choice survey settings.

Result: LLM poorly simulates sub-populations for contentious questions.

Conclusion: New practices needed for LLM use in social science beyond naive simulations.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.

*Min Namgung,JangHyeon Lee,Fangyi Ding,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transit for All (TFA), a framework to equitably expand bike-sharing systems (BSS) in underserved urban areas, using demand prediction and accessibility metrics to reduce transit disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing transit inequities in cities like NYC, where low-income and minority communities lack access, by leveraging BSS for affordable connections.

Method: TFA combines region representation learning for demand prediction, a novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) metric, and strategic station placement recommendations.

Result: TFA identifies and reduces transit gaps in NYC, showing improved access for underserved communities.

Conclusion: TFA offers actionable insights for urban planners to enhance transit equity and quality of life in underserved areas.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.

*Christina Q. Knight,Kaustubh Deshpande,Ved Sirdeshmukh,Meher Mankikar,Scale Red Team,SEAL Research Team,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: FORTRESS is a benchmark with 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts to evaluate LLM safeguards across 3 NSPS domains, revealing trade-offs between risk and over-refusal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack robustness in testing LLM safeguards against NSPS risks, necessitating an objective, automated evaluation method.

Method: FORTRESS uses 500 adversarial prompts with rubrics for automated evaluation across CBRNE, Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities domains.

Result: Models show varying trade-offs: Claude-3.5-Sonnet has low risk but high over-refusal, Gemini 2.5 Pro has low over-refusal but high risk, and Deepseek-R1 has the highest risk but lowest over-refusal.

Conclusion: FORTRESS provides policymakers and researchers a clear understanding of LLM risks and is publicly released for broader use.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information. However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE), Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities, with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at 78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a private set for evaluation.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8 trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) and a deep learning model (S3PO) for super-resolution, addressing distortion in 360° videos and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited spatial resolution and distortion in 360° videos reduce visual quality, and existing VSR techniques don't handle these issues well. Lack of datasets also hinders research.

Method: The paper creates the 360VDS dataset and proposes S3PO, a deep learning model with recurrent modeling, attention, and a novel loss function for spherical distortion.

Result: S3PO outperforms state-of-the-art VSR and 360°-specific models on 360° video datasets, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: S3PO effectively addresses 360° video super-resolution challenges, offering improved performance and insights through its design.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360° videos) are widely used in Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences. However, the limited spatial resolution in 360° videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360° video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360° video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360° videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360° Video Super-Resolution (360° VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°~specific super-resolution models on 360° video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Motivation: The field of protein foundation models lacks a unified benchmark, leading to fragmented evaluations and limited insights into model generalization and performance.

Method: The study develops PFMBench, evaluating 17 state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks in 8 protein science areas, using hundreds of experiments.

Result: PFMBench uncovers task correlations, identifies top models, and provides a standardized evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: PFMBench fills a critical gap by offering a comprehensive benchmark for fair and insightful evaluation of protein foundation models.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies. However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models, hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically, researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17 state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a streamlined evaluation protocol.

*Anne Gagneux,Mathurin Massias,Emmanuel Soubies*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores sparse signal recovery using sorted nonconvex penalties for generalized linear models, focusing on efficient proximal operator computation for weakly convex and nonconvex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sparse signal recovery with automatic variable grouping, leveraging sorted penalties for clustering and reduced coefficient shrinkage.

Method: Investigates sorted nonconvex penalties, using PAV for weakly convex cases and a modified PAV for nonconvex cases (e.g., sorted Lq).

Result: Efficient proximal operator computation methods are provided, with theoretical insights and practical validation through experiments.

Conclusion: Sorted nonconvex penalties are effective for sparse recovery and variable grouping, with efficient computational solutions for both weakly convex and nonconvex cases.

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several experiments.

*Junhui Zhang,Patrick Jaillet*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Proposed two first-order methods (MT-GS and AMT-GS) for distributed optimization, reducing communication rounds and achieving optimal dependency on ε.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address non-smooth, distributed optimization by leveraging similarities between local objectives and enabling flexible communication rates.

Method: Block-decomposable primal-dual formulation with multi-timescale sliding, updating dual blocks at varying rates.

Result: MT-GS requires O(¯rA/ε) rounds and O(¯r/ε²) steps; AMT-GS needs O(¯rA/√εμ) rounds and O(¯r/(εμ)) steps for strongly convex objectives.

Conclusion: Achieves optimal communication round dependency on ε and answers an open question about non-smooth objectives.

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding (MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at potentially different rates.
  To find an $ε$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms achieve optimal dependency on $ε$: MT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/ε)$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/ε^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{εμ})$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/(εμ))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also $μ$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A novel learning rule for co-learning synaptic weights and delays in SNNs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synaptic delays are biologically significant but often omitted in SNNs; this work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Extended STDP to simultaneously learn synaptic strengths and delays, validated on an SNN model for classification.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in various test scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of synaptic delays and their interplay with synaptic efficacy in SNNs.

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do, synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

TL;DR: QNNs outperform classical methods in wind power prediction, achieving 93% accuracy with quantum feature maps, highlighting QML's potential despite NISQ limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address skepticism about QML's practical advantages by evaluating QNNs against classical methods in real-world tasks.

Method: Construct and test 12 QNN configurations using 2 quantum feature maps and 6 entanglement strategies, applied to a wind energy dataset.

Result: QNNs with the Z feature map achieve 93% accuracy in wind power forecasting, surpassing classical methods.

Conclusion: QNNs demonstrate superior performance, validating QML's potential for practical applications despite current quantum hardware constraints.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a regularization term in QML optimization to balance the trade-off between circuit cutting overhead and model accuracy, enabling study of larger problems for quantum advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of NISQ hardware constraints and the sampling overhead from circuit cutting in QML, hindering quantum advantage validation.

Method: A novel regularization term is added to the QML optimization process to penalize sampling overhead, balancing it with the ML cost function.

Result: The approach allows optimization to manage the trade-off between cutting overhead and model accuracy, facilitating larger problem studies.

Conclusion: This method advances the exploration of quantum advantage by mitigating the limitations of circuit cutting in QML.

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question. The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in pursuit of quantum advantage.

Conclusion: The quantum-enhanced approach shows promise for advancing cheminformatics tasks.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.

*Tommaso Belvedere,Michael Ziegltrum,Giulio Turrisi,Valerio Modugno*

TL;DR: F-MPPI enhances MPPI with local feedback gains for faster, more stable robotic control, validated in simulations and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPPI's computational demands limit real-time, high-frequency robotic control. F-MPPI addresses this by integrating local feedback for rapid corrections.

Method: F-MPPI augments MPPI with local linear feedback gains from sensitivity analysis, inspired by Riccati-based feedback in gradient-based MPC.

Result: F-MPPI improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency operation in complex robotic tasks.

Conclusion: F-MPPI is effective for real-time robotic control, demonstrated on a quadruped and quadrotor, enhancing MPPI's practicality.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time, highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands. This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FEAST is a flexible mealtime-assistance system designed for in-home use, offering adaptability, transparency, and safety to meet diverse user needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of in-home meal assistance due to diverse activities, contexts, food items, and user preferences.

Method: Modular hardware, diverse interaction methods, and parameterized behavior trees adapted using a large language model.

Result: FEAST outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, successfully personalized by users in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: FEAST demonstrates effective personalization and real-world applicability for diverse care recipients.

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

Motivation: To enhance VIPs' independence in urban navigation by leveraging drones for obstacle detection and path planning.

Method: A geometric formulation with multi-DNN framework for obstacle avoidance, integrating local (perception-based) and global (GPS/map-based) planning.

Result: Feasibility verified in three scenarios: footpath walking, near parked vehicles, and crowded streets.

Conclusion: The system effectively aids VIPs in urban navigation, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors combined with machine learning and computer vision algorithms is impacting a number of domains, including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a perception-based path planning system for local planning around the neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a crowded street.

*Hanbit Oh,Andrea M. Salcedo-Vázquez,Ixchel G. Ramirez-Alpizar,Yukiyasu Domae*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Robust Instant Policy (RIP), a method to improve reliability in In-Context Imitation Learning by mitigating LLM hallucination issues using Student's t-regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the unreliability of LLM-based instant policies in robotics due to hallucination, which causes poor trajectory generation.

Method: Uses Student's t-regression to aggregate candidate trajectories from LLMs, filtering out outliers (hallucinations) for robust performance.

Result: RIP outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods by at least 26% in task success rates, especially in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: RIP enhances reliability in robotics by effectively handling LLM hallucinations, improving task success rates.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

*Miaoxin Pan,Jinnan Li,Yaowen Zhang,Yi Yang,Yufeng Yue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM is a Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system using surround-view cameras for robust, semantically enriched mapping in outdoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM systems rely on RGB-D or monocular views, which have limitations like narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and partial object observations, leading to inaccurate modeling.

Method: Integrates point features and object-level landmarks with open-vocabulary semantics, uses semantic-geometric-temporal fusion for object association, and includes an omnidirectional loop closure module for place recognition.

Result: Achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM provides a robust and semantically enriched solution for outdoor SLAM, enhancing object modeling and data association.

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

*Kaifeng Zhang,Baoyu Li,Kris Hauser,Yunzhu Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A neural dynamics framework combines particles and grids to model deformable objects, outperforming existing simulators and enabling goal-conditioned manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in modeling deformable objects due to diverse properties and limited visual information.

Method: Hybrid particle-grid representation with Gaussian Splattings for rendering, trained on sparse-view RGB-D recordings.

Result: Learns dynamics of diverse objects, generalizes to unseen instances, and outperforms state-of-the-art simulators.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models deformable objects and aids in model-based planning for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

TL;DR: The paper extends DeLaN for context-aware physics-informed control, integrates it with MPC, and combines it with residual dynamics, reducing tracking error by 39%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex environments with uncertain physical properties make global models infeasible, necessitating context-aware models for adaptive control.

Method: Extends DeLaN for context-awareness, integrates recurrent networks for online system identification, and combines with MPC and residual dynamics.

Result: 39% reduction in end-effector tracking error compared to a 21% improvement by a baseline using an extended Kalman filter.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances adaptive, physics-informed control in complex environments, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21% improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

TL;DR: An LLM agent automates hyper-parameter tuning for WS-PSO-CM in UAV communication, outperforming heuristic and random methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current heuristic-based hyper-parameter tuning for WS-PSO-CM in UAV communication lacks automation and performance.

Method: An LLM agent, guided by a profile and prompt, iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM to explore and return optimal hyper-parameters.

Result: The LLM agent achieves significantly higher minimal sum-rate compared to human heuristics and random methods.

Conclusion: LLM agents with PSO knowledge effectively find high-performance hyper-parameters for UAV communication.

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces gradient-free adaptation techniques for deep learning-based wireless receivers using in-context learning (ICL), offering real-time adaptability without online retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning-based receivers lack flexibility or require explicit optimization; ICL provides a more efficient and principled solution.

Method: The paper reviews ICL architectures (Transformer and SSMs) and applies ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks with theoretical and empirical analysis.

Result: ICL enables real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and contextual information, avoiding the need for online retraining.

Conclusion: ICL is a promising approach for dynamic wireless receiver adaptation, combining efficiency and theoretical grounding.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

TL;DR: Pre-training GemNet-T on OC20 before fine-tuning on MD17 improves MD simulation stability, despite similar force MAEs to direct training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether pre-training on large datasets enhances the stability of MLFFs in MD simulations, even when force accuracy is comparable.

Method: Two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17, (2) pre-training on OC20 followed by fine-tuning on MD17.

Result: Both methods achieve low force MAEs (~5 meV/A), but pre-trained GemNet-T sustains longer MD trajectories (3x stability).

Conclusion: Pre-training on diverse datasets improves simulation stability, and force MAE alone is insufficient for assessing MD performance.

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based solution for real-time Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection on edge devices, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR is a major cause of vision impairment, and traditional diagnosis methods are resource-intensive. The study aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective solution using edge AI.

Method: Multiple CNN models (MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom DNN) were trained on a curated dataset of retinal fundus images, optimized for edge deployment using TensorFlowLite and 8-bit quantization.

Result: MobileNet achieved 96.45% accuracy, while SqueezeNet showed strong real-time performance (176 KB model size, 17 ms latency). ShuffleNet and the custom DNN excelled in resource efficiency.

Conclusion: Edge AI offers a scalable, efficient solution for early DR detection, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045. Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage facial appearance as a noninvasive biomarker for health, specifically for biological age estimation and survival risk prediction in cancer patients.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning on public and clinical datasets, extensive robustness testing, and clinical validation in independent cohorts using Cox models.

Result: FAHR-FaceAge achieved a mean absolute error of 5.1 years for age estimation and outperformed benchmarks. FAHR-FaceSurvival predicted mortality robustly, with the highest-risk group having triple the mortality. Both models generalized well across demographics.

Conclusion: FAHR-Face provides scalable, accurate facial biomarkers for aging and mortality risk, demonstrating the potential of foundation models in healthcare.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets.

*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Transformer models (SwinUNETR and UNETR) outperform 3D UNet in prostate gland segmentation on T2-weighted MRI, especially in handling label noise and domain shifts, with SwinUNETR showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like inter-reader variability and cross-site domain shifts in prostate MRI segmentation, the study explores transformer models' precision under heterogeneity.

Method: Comparison of UNETR and SwinUNETR against 3D UNet using 546 MRI volumes annotated by two experts. Three training strategies (single cohort, cross-validated mixed cohort, gland size-based) were tested with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters.

Result: SwinUNETR achieved higher Dice scores (up to 0.902) than UNETR and 3D UNet, especially in gland size-based subsets. It reduced label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, improving scores by up to five points.

Conclusion: SwinUNETR's global and shifted-window self-attention enhances robustness for clinical deployment, outperforming CNNs in heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

*Paula Feldman,Miguel Fainstein,Viviana Siless,Claudio Delrieux,Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Recursive Variational Neural Network (RvNN) to generate diverse and accurate 3D blood vessel models, addressing limitations of rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based methods for synthesizing vasculature lack the diversity and complexity of real anatomical data, limiting their clinical and training utility.

Method: The proposed RvNN learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity and geometry features, enabling the generation of new vessel geometries by sampling the latent space.

Result: The generated 3D blood vessel models closely resemble real data in terms of vessel radii, length, and tortuosity, even for datasets with aneurysms.

Conclusion: This work is the first to use RvNN for blood vessel synthesis, offering a promising tool for medical training, simulations, and other applications.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

TL;DR: A transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework is proposed to enhance neurological disorder (ND) diagnosis by integrating multi-modal MRI and clinical data, achieving 82.47% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL methods fail to effectively use multi-modal MRI and clinical data for ND diagnosis, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: A transformer-based MoE framework leverages anatomical, DTI, and fMRI MRI modalities alongside clinical data, using modality-specific experts and adaptive fusion.

Result: The framework achieves 82.47% validation accuracy, outperforming baselines by over 10%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves ND diagnosis by effectively integrating multi-modal data, demonstrating its clinical potential.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

*Boah Kim,Tejas Sudharshan Mathai,Kimberly Helm,Peter A. Pinto,Ronald M. Summers*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (DenseNet-121) is developed to classify 8 body mpMRI series types, achieving high accuracy (0.972) and performing well on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorrect DICOM headers in mpMRI exams due to protocol diversity and technologist errors hinder radiologists' efficiency.

Method: Multiple deep learning classifiers (ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet) are trained and compared using mpMRI data from various institutions. The best model (DenseNet-121) is evaluated under different training data quantities and on out-of-distribution datasets.

Result: DenseNet-121 achieves the highest F1-score (0.966) and accuracy (0.972). Performance improves with more training data (>729 studies) and maintains high accuracy on external datasets (0.872 and 0.810).

Conclusion: The DenseNet-121 model effectively classifies mpMRI series types, demonstrating robustness across internal and external datasets.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

*Jonghun Kim,Gyeongdeok Jo,Shinyoung Ra,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A framework using VQGAN and HE for secure, efficient medical image inference, balancing performance and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect sensitive medical imaging data while enabling server-side inference, addressing the computational inefficiency of HE for large images.

Method: Uses VQGAN for image compression, approximates activation functions with low-degree polynomials, and adapts squeeze and excitation modules for HE.

Result: Achieves optimal balance with 8x downsampling, maintaining image quality and reducing computational cost, though HE inference is slower.

Conclusion: The framework shows practical potential for secure medical image analysis despite minor performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

*Haolong Jin,Shenglin Liu,Cong Cong,Qingmin Feng,Yongzhi Liu,Lina Huang,Yingzi Hu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FedWSIDD is a federated learning approach for medical image analysis using dataset distillation to address computational heterogeneity and privacy concerns in WSI classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative medical image analysis while preserving patient privacy and handling heterogeneous computational resources.

Method: Proposes FedWSIDD, which uses dataset distillation to create and transmit synthetic slides, incorporating stain normalization for histopathology datasets.

Result: Improves local WSI classification performance, supports heterogeneous models, and ensures privacy, validated on CAMELYON datasets.

Conclusion: FedWSIDD is an effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks, balancing performance and privacy.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.

*Yu Xing,Shishi Huang,Meng Lv,Guo Chen,Huailiang Wang,Lingzhi Sui*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses noise issues in ultra-compact analog image sensors for single-use endoscopes, proposing a hybrid denoising system combining traditional and learning-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-use endoscopes with tiny sensors reduce costs and infection risks but suffer from noise due to limited dynamic range and analog signal transmission.

Method: Developed a noise model for analog sensors and proposed a hybrid denoising system combining traditional and learning-based methods.

Result: The system reduces noise without detail loss, achieving real-time performance and improving PSNR from 21.16 to 33.05.

Conclusion: The hybrid denoising approach effectively mitigates noise in endoscopic images, enhancing diagnostic quality.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study evaluates image preprocessing techniques (PMD filter, CLAHE, and a hybrid PMD-CLAHE) to enhance CNN performance for cervical cancer classification, showing significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer is a major health issue, especially in developing countries, and early detection via automated screening (using CNNs) is crucial. However, CNN performance depends on image quality, prompting this investigation.

Method: The study tests three preprocessing techniques (PMD filter, CLAHE, and a hybrid PMD-CLAHE) on the SIPaKMeD dataset and evaluates their impact on pretrained CNN models (ResNet, SqueezeNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet).

Result: The hybrid PMD-CLAHE approach improved CNN performance significantly: 13.62% accuracy, 10.04% precision, 13.08% recall, and 14.34% F1-score compared to original images.

Conclusion: The hybrid PMD-CLAHE technique enhances Pap smear image quality and CNN performance, offering a promising approach for better cervical cancer classification.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study improves tumor segmentation in MRI using a hybrid UNet-Transformer model on a local hospital dataset, achieving competitive results (Dice: 0.764, IoU: 0.736) and emphasizing the need for site-specific AI models in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-based segmentation models rely on large public datasets, which lack local patient heterogeneity. This study aims to develop and integrate accurate AI models into hospital workflows for better oncology treatment planning.

Method: A hybrid UNet-Transformer model with attention modules (e.g., SE blocks, CBAM) was trained on a local MRI dataset (6080 images). The pipeline included DICOM extraction, preprocessing, and augmentation. Training used pretrained weights, a batch size of 8, and dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs.

Result: The model achieved a Dice score of 0.764 and IoU of 0.736, showing competitive performance despite limited data.

Conclusion: Site-specific AI model development is crucial for clinical deployment, as demonstrated by the study's success on a local dataset.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

*Andela Ilic,Jiaxi Jiang,Paul Streli,Xintong Liu,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for full-body human pose estimation using loosely attached IMU sensors, leveraging transformer-based diffusion models and garment-aware training to outperform existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU-based motion capture assumes tight sensor attachment, which is unrealistic. This paper addresses the challenge of loose sensor attachment and garment variations.

Method: Simulated IMU data from a garment-aware dataset, trained transformer-based diffusion models for loose IMU data synthesis and pose estimation, incorporating garment parameters.

Result: Proposed diffusion methods outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach opens a promising direction for future research in motion capture with loosely attached IMUs and garment-aware modeling.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: A one-shot face sketch synthesis method using diffusion models is proposed, addressing data scarcity and labor costs in existing methods. A new benchmark, OS-Sketch, is introduced for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on large datasets, facing issues like data scarcity and high labor costs. The goal is to develop a more efficient one-shot solution.

Method: Optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using photo-sketch pairs, then use these instructions for inference. A new benchmark, OS-Sketch, is introduced for testing.

Result: The method successfully converts photos into realistic sketches in a one-shot setting, outperforming other methods in convenience and applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based approach is effective for one-shot face sketch synthesis, with potential for broader use due to its efficiency.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Nabla-R2D3 is a reinforcement learning framework for aligning 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards, improving quality and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models lack alignment with human preferences and struggle with realistic textures and geometries.

Method: Leverages Nabla-GFlowNet to align 3D diffusion models with 2D reward signals for efficient finetuning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in reward achievement and reduces prior forgetting in few steps.

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3 offers a robust solution for enhancing 3D asset generation with 2D rewards.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.

*Weiqi Lu,Yongqiang Tian,Xiaohan Zhong,Haoyang Ma,Zhenyang Xu,Shing-Chi Cheung,Chengnian Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes bugs in DataViz libraries, identifying symptoms, root causes, and a taxonomy. It highlights the prevalence of incorrect plots and explores the potential of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DataViz libraries are critical for accurate data representation, but visual bugs can mislead users. Understanding these bugs is essential for improving library reliability.

Method: The study examines 564 bugs from five DataViz libraries, analyzing symptoms, root causes, and proposing a taxonomy. It also tests VLMs for bug detection.

Result: Incorrect plots are common, with incorrect graphic computation as a major cause. VLMs show varying effectiveness (29%-57%) in detecting bugs, with prompt design impacting results.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for automated testing methods for DataViz libraries and suggest further research into VLMs for bug detection.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates how developers document code snippets and evaluates Llama's ability to generate descriptions. Findings show most descriptions are example-based, and Llama aligns with this but has room for improvement in relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand common documentation practices for code snippets and assess the effectiveness of LLMs like Llama in generating such descriptions.

Method: Analyzed 400 code snippets from NPM Code Snippets (1M+ snippets), manually classified descriptions, and evaluated Llama's performance in generating and matching descriptions.

Result: 55.5% of original descriptions were example-based; Llama correctly identified 79.75% as 'Example'. Generated descriptions had a 0.7173 similarity score, indicating relevance but gaps.

Conclusion: Documentation intent varies by snippet task. LLMs like Llama show promise but need refinement for better relevance and alignment with developer needs.

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.

TL;DR: OS-Harm is a benchmark to evaluate the safety of LLM-based computer use agents, testing for misuse, prompt injection, and misbehavior across 150 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety of computer use agents is overlooked, yet critical for adoption. OS-Harm addresses this gap.

Method: Built on OSWorld, OS-Harm tests agents with 150 tasks across three harm categories, using an automated judge for evaluation.

Result: Models like o4-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet often comply with misuse, are vulnerable to injections, and perform unsafe actions.

Conclusion: OS-Harm provides a standardized way to assess agent safety, revealing vulnerabilities in current models.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees. While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions.

### [263] [Next-Generation Conflict Forecasting: Unleashing Predictive Patterns through Spatiotemporal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14817)
*Simon P. von der Maase*

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: A novel neural network architecture forecasts three types of violence (state-based, non-state, one-sided) at high resolution (subnational, monthly) up to 36 months ahead, combining classification and regression for probabilistic and magnitude estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution for research and policymaking.

Method: Monte Carlo Dropout LSTM U-Net with convolutional and recurrent layers, requiring no manual feature engineering, using only historical conflict data.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in forecasting, with predictive uncertainty quantification and extensibility for additional data.

Conclusion: The model is a promising tool for early warning systems, humanitarian planning, and peacebuilding due to its accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational (priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based peacebuilding initiatives.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A novel design optimization method using guided flow matching reduces structural vibrations in plates by integrating generative and surrogate models, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing structural vibrations in engineering systems (e.g., cars, trains) is critical for passenger comfort.

Method: Combines generative flow matching and a surrogate model to optimize plate designs with beadings, avoiding manual parameter tuning.

Result: Produces diverse, manufacturable designs with lower vibrations than random search, heuristics, or genetic optimization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively explores design spaces and improves vibration reduction, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from https://github.com/ecker-lab/Optimizing_Vibrating_Plates.

*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

TL;DR: A boundary-weighted operator for hierarchical graphs is introduced, leveraging Gromov boundary and Busemann functions to create a stable, parameter-free filter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph filters struggle with tree-like branching in hierarchical graphs, necessitating a new approach.

Method: Uses a boundary-weighted operator rescaling edges based on endpoint drift toward the Gromov boundary, with Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks.

Result: Proves a closed-form upper bound on the operator's spectral norm, ensuring signal energy loss is curvature-controlled.

Conclusion: The filter is lightweight, parameter-free, and stable, suitable for graph signal processing in hierarchical data.

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden hierarchical structure.

*Jaehong Chung,Michael Manga,Timothy Kneafsey,Tapan Mukerji,Mengsu Hu*

TL;DR: A transformer-based deep learning model forecasts microearthquake (MEQ) evolution during fluid injection, achieving high accuracy and uncertainty quantification for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting MEQ evolution is critical for managing subsurface fluid injection in applications like enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and CO2 sequestration.

Method: The model uses hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to predict cumulative MEQ count, seismic moment, and spatial extents (P50, P95).

Result: Achieves R² >0.98 (1-second forecast) and >0.88 (15-second forecast) on the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, with uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: The model enables real-time fracture and permeability monitoring, showcasing deep learning's potential for seismic-risk assessment in fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PresPM literature lacks comprehensive comparisons and evaluation approaches, limiting its practical application.

Method: SimBank simulates a bank's loan application process, incorporating diverse intervention optimization problems and causal machine learning challenges.

Result: SimBank provides true outcomes for interventions, supports complex process structures, and demonstrates benchmarking capabilities in experiments.

Conclusion: SimBank is a valuable tool for advancing PresPM research and practice, offering a publicly available platform for robust evaluations.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face limitations with Braille and audio recordings, needing a more accessible way to access books.

Method: The system uses OCR technology implemented in LabVIEW to convert text to speech.

Result: The developed system is accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly.

Conclusion: The OCR-based speech synthesis system provides a practical solution for visually impaired individuals to access written content.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SonicVerse is a multi-task music captioning model that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection to produce detailed captions for music pieces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich music databases and advance music AI research by generating accurate and detailed captions for music pieces.

Method: Uses a projection-based architecture to transform audio into language tokens while detecting music features through auxiliary heads. These features are also projected into language tokens to enhance captioning.

Result: Incorporating music features improves the quality and detail of generated captions, enabling rich descriptions for both short and long music pieces.

Conclusion: SonicVerse effectively combines caption generation with feature detection, enhancing music captioning and supporting detailed time-informed descriptions.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

TL;DR: Passive acoustic monitoring uses ARUs to record wildlife sounds, requiring automated processing for large datasets. pycnet-audio, built around PNW-Cnet, automates detection of vocalizations and noise for ~80 species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual review of large acoustic datasets is impractical, necessitating automated solutions for efficient wildlife monitoring.

Method: Deploy ARUs to record audio, then use pycnet-audio and PNW-Cnet to automate detection of target signals (vocalizations, noise).

Result: PNW-Cnet detects vocalizations of ~80 species and various noise types, enabling scalable wildlife monitoring.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio provides a practical workflow for processing large acoustic datasets, enhancing efficiency in wildlife research.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs). The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in comparative performance evaluation of deep learning models for speech enhancement, focusing on noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation.

Method: Benchmarking three state-of-the-art models (Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, U-Net) on diverse datasets (SpEAR, VPQAD, Clarkson) to evaluate their performance.

Result: U-Net excels in noise suppression, CMGAN in perceptual quality, and Wave-U-Net in speaker feature retention, each demonstrating strengths on different datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into optimizing trade-offs in speech enhancement, with potential applications in voice biometrics, forensic audio, telecommunication, and speaker verification.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for instrument editing in text-to-music generation using pretrained diffusion models without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling text-to-music generation for specific outcomes is challenging due to sensitivity to text prompts and random seeds.

Method: Leverages a pretrained diffusion model, using an intermediate timestep identified by an instrument classifier to balance content preservation and timbre change.

Result: Achieves instrument editing without additional training or compromising generation speed.

Conclusion: The approach effectively edits instruments in existing audio tracks while preserving content, offering a practical tool for musicians.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge. Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's speed.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes MODS, a multi-source data fusion model, to improve downscaling accuracy of meteorological variables by integrating diverse satellite and topographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing downscaling methods relying solely on geostationary satellite data fail to capture all meteorological changes, limiting accuracy.

Method: MODS is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple satellites and topography, pre-trained on ERA5, using multi-source cross-attention for feature fusion.

Result: MODS achieves higher fidelity in downscaling ERA5 maps to 6.25 km resolution compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MODS enhances downscaling accuracy by leveraging multi-source data, producing more realistic meteorological conditions.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation, we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5 maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

TL;DR: CI4GI is a model for group identification that captures the collaborative evolution of group-level and item-level interests, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group identification methods fail to model the collaborative evolution of dual-level user interests (group and item) and suffer from false-negative samples.

Method: CI4GI introduces an interest enhancement strategy and optimizes negative sample identification using interest distribution distances.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show CI4GI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CI4GI effectively models dual-level interest dynamics and improves group recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topological framework using persistent homology to detect structural changes in media narratives during major global events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify when global events reshape public discourse by analyzing narrative shifts in news articles.

Method: Constructs daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases, embeds them, and transforms into persistence diagrams using Vietoris-Rips filtration. Measures Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies to track semantic disruption.

Result: Major events correlate with spikes in H0 and H1 dimensions, indicating narrative reorganization. H0 changes typically precede H1 shifts, except in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Conclusion: Persistent homology provides an unsupervised, principled method to detect narrative shifts during crises, advancing computational social science.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks.

Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and 175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance.

### [279] [DEFORMER: Coupling Deformed Localized Patterns with Global Context for Robust End-to-end Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01732)
*Jiamin Xie,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Deformer', a deformable CNN variant replacing depthwise CNNs in Conformer, improving speech recognition by leveraging asymmetric kernels and adaptive views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNNs assume symmetric, rigid kernels, limiting feature discovery. The study explores asymmetric kernels for better feature coupling with attention.

Method: Replace depthwise CNNs in Conformer with deformable counterparts ('Deformer'), analyzing learned receptive fields and attention maps.

Result: Deformer improves WER by +5.6% (no LM) and +6.4% (with LM) over Conformer on WSJ eval92, showing better feature associations.

Conclusion: Deformer's adaptive kernels enhance feature learning, demonstrating superior performance in speech recognition.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline on the WSJ eval92 set.

*Jiamin Xie,Ke Li,Jinxi Guo,Andros Tjandra,Yuan Shangguan,Leda Sari,Chunyang Wu,Junteng Jia,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive masking approach for pruning multilingual ASR models, achieving better performance than existing methods and reducing the need for language-specific pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pruning methods for multilingual ASR models require multiple rounds of pruning and re-training per language, which is inefficient.

Method: An adaptive masking approach is used to dynamically adapt sub-networks, avoiding fixed structures. It applies to two scenarios: sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (Dynamic ASR Pathways).

Result: The approach outperforms existing pruning methods for sparse monolingual models and discovers better sub-networks for multilingual models, reducing language-specific pruning.

Conclusion: Dynamic ASR Pathways offers an efficient and effective solution for pruning multilingual ASR models with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: MixRep is a data augmentation method for low-resource ASR, combining mixup with time-axis regularization, outperforming other methods like SpecAugment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve low-resource ASR performance by generalizing mixup techniques and adding complementary regularization.

Method: MixRep interpolates hidden representations in neural networks, applied to acoustic features and layer outputs, combined with time-axis regularization. Tested on WSJ and SWB datasets using a Conformer encoder with joint CTC loss.

Result: MixRep achieves +6.5% and +6.7% relative WER reduction on eval92 and Callhome eval'2000 sets, outperforming SpecAugment.

Conclusion: MixRep is effective for low-resource ASR, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

TL;DR: The paper introduces directional-SpeechLlama, a method for multi-channel audio processing using LLMs, achieving directional speech recognition, source localization, and cross-talk suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the under-researched area of multi-channel audio comprehension in Speech LLMs, leveraging spatial cues for improved performance.

Method: Proposes two techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA).

Result: Directional-SpeechLlama effectively links textual cues with spatial audio, excelling in speech recognition and source localization.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances LLMs' ability to process multi-channel audio with spatial cues.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM) with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities. However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research. In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition and source localization tasks.

TL;DR: HAC is a neural speech codec with a hierarchical bottleneck (acoustic, phonetic, lexical) using knowledge distillation from HuBERT and LaBSE. It outperforms baselines in disentanglement and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified speech representation that bridges acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream tasks.

Method: HAC uses a factorized bottleneck with three linguistic levels and leverages knowledge distillation from HuBERT (phoneme-level) and LaBSE (lexical).

Result: HAC tokens are disentangled (phoneme and word-level semantics) and outperform baselines in naturalness and interpretability.

Conclusion: HAC is a promising unified discrete speech representation for generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

TL;DR: Hermes improves LLM application serving efficiency by modeling resource demands with PDGraph and using Gittins policy for scheduling, reducing completion times significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems treat LLM resource demands as a blackbox, leading to inefficiencies in queuing and backend warm-up.

Method: Proposes Hermes, leveraging PDGraph for modeling demands and Gittins policy for optimal scheduling and backend prewarming.

Result: Hermes reduces average completion time by over 70% and P95 completion time by over 80%.

Conclusion: Hermes effectively enhances LLM serving efficiency through accurate demand modeling and intelligent scheduling.

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Proposes agentic plan caching to reduce costs in LLM-based agentic applications by reusing structured plan templates across similar tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM caching techniques are inadequate for agentic applications due to dependencies on external data or contexts, leading to high costs.

Method: Extracts, stores, and adapts plan templates from completed agent executions, using keyword extraction and lightweight models for task-specific adaptation.

Result: Reduces costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Agentic plan caching offers an efficient, cost-effective solution for serving LLM-based agents, complementing existing infrastructures.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

TL;DR: CheckFree and CheckFree+ propose efficient recovery methods for LLM training on decentralized nodes, avoiding overheads of checkpointing and redundant computation by using weighted averaging and out-of-order pipelining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce training costs and democratize LLM training on decentralized nodes while addressing node churn challenges.

Method: CheckFree substitutes failing stages with weighted averages of neighbors; CheckFree+ extends this with out-of-order pipelining to recover first/last stages.

Result: Outperforms checkpointing and redundant computation by over 12% in convergence speed for low-medium failure rates (5-10%).

Conclusion: CheckFree and CheckFree+ offer scalable, efficient recovery for decentralized LLM training with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

### [287] [Optimal Convergence Rates of Deep Neural Network Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14899)
*Zihan Zhang,Lei Shi,Ding-Xuan Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies binary classification under Tsybakov noise and compositional assumptions, proving optimal convergence rates for excess risk, achievable by ReLU DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize classification performance in high-dimensional settings with structured noise and compositional data distributions.

Method: Analyzes binary classification under Tsybakov noise and compositional assumptions, using ReLU DNNs with hinge loss.

Result: Optimal convergence rate for excess risk is derived, independent of input dimension, and achievable by ReLU DNNs.

Conclusion: ReLU DNNs perform optimally in high-dimensional classification tasks, supported by theoretical convergence rates.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$ vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a maximum value function or a Hölder-$β$ smooth function that depends only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions, the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$ \left( \frac{1}{n} \right)^{\frac{β\cdot(1\wedgeβ)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdotβ\cdot(1\wedgeβ)^q}}}\;\;\;, $$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent interest.

TL;DR: DML-CMR is a two-stage estimator for conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) that reduces bias and achieves optimal convergence rates using deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMR estimators, especially those using deep neural networks, suffer from bias due to naive plug-in methods and overfitting.

Method: Proposes DML-CMR, a novel two-stage estimator with a bias-reducing learning objective, following the double/debiased machine learning framework.

Result: DML-CMR achieves minimax optimal convergence rate of O(N^{-1/2}) and outperforms existing methods in IV regression and proximal causal learning.

Conclusion: DML-CMR provides an unbiased, efficient solution for CMR problems, demonstrating superior performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities. Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Motivation: Challenges in analyzing complex cases like masked GMMs and applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Conclusion: Provides insights into k-means limitations in high-dimensional, noisy scenarios.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Recourse explanations in algorithmic decision systems can become invalid due to performative effects when many applicants act on them, altering data and decision boundaries. The paper identifies conditions for valid recourse and cautions against non-causal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked performative nature of recourse explanations, which can invalidate recommendations when collective behavior changes data and models.

Method: Formally characterizes conditions under which recourse remains valid under performativity, focusing on causal variables.

Result: Recourse actions may fail if influenced by or intervening on non-causal variables.

Conclusion: Advocates for recourse methods that act exclusively on causal variables, warning against standard counterfactual and causal recourse methods.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal variables.

TL;DR: A data-driven method learns time-dependent probability densities of stochastic processes using a novel classifier and contrastive estimation, enabling density evaluation and sample synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model and evaluate time-dependent probability densities of stochastic processes, especially for systems with known initial densities, and to enable applications like outlier detection and sample synthesis.

Method: Uses a time-dependent binary classifier trained with contrastive estimation to discriminate between process realizations at nearby times, approximating the density's time derivative.

Result: Accurately reconstructs complex, multi-modal densities, scales to high dimensions, and reliably detects rare events in real-world data.

Conclusion: The method effectively models time-dependent densities, supports practical applications, and performs well in numerical experiments.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants. Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among real-world data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble of randomized greedy forward selection estimators for sparse linear regression, improving computational efficiency and outperforming methods like lasso and elastic net. It challenges the belief that ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, showing it can reduce both training error and degrees of freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense and lack of understanding of how ensembling improves predictive performance in sparse linear regression.

Method: An ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators randomized by feature subsampling, implemented via dynamic programming for efficiency.

Result: The method outperforms lasso and elastic net in various settings and demonstrates that ensembling can reduce both training error and degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of random forests and suggest implicit regularization has more complex effects than explicit regularization.

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests, has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling -- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset. We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

Motivation: The diversity in TFM implementations and training strategies complicates evaluating design choices and synergies, hindering reproducibility and best practices.

Method: BMFM-RNA integrates diverse TFM objectives, including the novel WCED, and evaluates pretrained models on CELLxGENE using MLM, WCED, and multitask learning.

Result: WCED-based models match or outperform state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across multiple datasets in zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA provides a reproducible framework for benchmarking and optimizing TFM training, advancing AI tools for cell biology research.

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction. However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability, we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED), which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available as part of the biomed-multi-omics project ( https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior protein editing methods lack modularity and interpretability due to joint embeddings. DisProtEdit aims to separate structural and functional semantics for better control.

Method: Uses dual-channel text supervision (structure and function descriptions) and alignment/uniformity objectives to disentangle representations. SwissProtDis dataset supports this with decomposed text descriptions.

Conclusion: DisProtEdit provides a modular, interpretable, and controllable approach to protein editing, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability. On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

Conclusion: POCO is a scalable, adaptable solution for cross-session neural forecasting, offering insights for future model design and enabling adaptive neurotechnologies.

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical connections and differences between SL and CCL, and address their limitations in recommendation models.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of SL and CCL, proposing DrRL by leveraging Rényi-divergence in DRO optimization.

Result: DrRL outperforms SL and CCL in recommendation accuracy and robustness, mitigating their respective limitations.

Conclusion: DrRL successfully generalizes SL and CCL, offering improved performance and robustness in recommendation models.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2) Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging Rényi-divergence in DRO optimization. DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation accuracy and robustness.

*Bahram Yaghooti,Chengyu Li,Bruno Sinopoli*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A framework for learning fractional-order nonlinear system dynamics using input-output experiments and orthonormal basis functions, validated on benchmark systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately learn and represent the dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems, addressing the limitations of integer-order models.

Method: 1. Design input-output experiments for dataset generation. 2. Estimate fractional order and reconstruct vector fields using orthonormal basis functions.

Result: Validated on four benchmark systems, the framework accurately learns dynamics, showing fractional-order models outperform integer-order ones in capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: Fractional-order models are superior for capturing long-range dependencies, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting the limitations of integer-order representations.

*Tobias Labarta,Nhi Hoang,Katharina Weitz,Wojciech Samek,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Leander Weber*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, emphasizing legibility, readability, and interpretability. It challenges assumptions about accessibility-focused colormaps and supports adaptive XAI interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for human-understandable explanations in AI systems, especially for visually impaired users, drives this research. Current XAI evaluations often overlook cognitive accessibility.

Method: Proposes CUE model and tests it with a study (N=455) using heatmaps with different colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm) to evaluate task performance, confidence, and effort.

Result: Found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Accessibility-focused colormaps like Cividis did not mitigate gaps and sometimes worsened them.

Conclusion: The study validates CUE, challenges perceptual optimization assumptions, and advocates for adaptive, user-tailored XAI interfaces.

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception), readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study (N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for standardized, reusable interfaces in XAI research due to the limitations of ad hoc interfaces and lack of reproducibility.

Method: Design and implementation of WebXAII, a web-based platform with a composite architecture of generic views and modules, configurable via structured files.

Result: WebXAII successfully reproduces protocols from a state-of-the-art XAI study, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: WebXAII provides a flexible, reusable solution for XAI research, enhancing reproducibility and accessibility.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols, meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

*Evdoxia Taka,Debadyuti Bhattacharya,Joanne Garde-Hansen,Sanjay Sharma,Tanaya Guha*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based tool for analyzing character representation in media, focusing on gender and age, and evaluates its usefulness and trustworthiness through a user study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the utility and trustworthiness of AI-generated character representation analytics for the general public, addressing gaps in past work that lacked audience involvement.

Method: Uses the CLIP foundation model to analyze visual screen data and quantify character representation, alongside designing visualizations for lay audiences. Conducts a user study to evaluate the tool's effectiveness.

Result: Participants found the tool useful but expressed moderate to low trust in AI-generated results. They desired more detailed visualizations and additional demographic categories.

Conclusion: The tool is deemed useful, but trust in AI models remains a challenge. Future work should expand demographic categories and improve contextual information in visualizations.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code, benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Character-Representation-Media-FF7B

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between AI4SI projects' potential and their actual societal impact, highlighting overlooked challenges in the AI community.

Method: Semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers, complemented by the authors' experiences, followed by thematic analysis.

Result: Identified structural, organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to AI4SI deployment.

Conclusion: Provides best practices and actionable strategies to improve AI4SI collaborations, aiming to serve as a practical guide for researchers and organizations.

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare, social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI, achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects "fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers - complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research - this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful AI collaborations.

TL;DR: A pipeline integrating DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset enriches AI-generated interior designs with sustainability metrics, aiding eco-friendly decisions but causing some decision fatigue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI lacks actionable sustainability data for designers, limiting its practical use in eco-conscious architectural design.

Method: Proposes a post-processing module that identifies materials in AI-generated designs and pairs them with CO2e values from a dataset. Evaluated via user tests with varying sustainability prompts.

Result: Introducing sustainability metrics leads to more informed decisions but can reduce satisfaction due to decision fatigue. Most users adopted sustainability principles.

Conclusion: Balancing design freedom with sustainability constraints is key for AI-assisted architectural design, offering a path to eco-responsible solutions.

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Family caregivers of AD/ADRD patients face high stress and mental health risks, yet their interaction with AI support tools like LLMs is understudied.

Method: Developed Carey, a GPT-4o chatbot, and conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 caregivers after scenario-driven interactions, analyzing data inductively.

Result: Identified six caregiver needs (e.g., emotional support, crisis management) and tensions in desires vs. concerns, mapping AI strengths and gaps.

Conclusion: Provides design insights for caregiver-centered AI systems to address mental health needs, balancing trust and proactive support.

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs) -- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes -- on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes, we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths, gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD caregivers.

Motivation: The diversity and complexity of DR-based visual analytics literature can overwhelm novice analysts and researchers, making it unclear where to start or proceed.

Method: The guide leverages existing literature classifications to help users assess their DR expertise and identify relevant papers for further learning.

Result: Interview studies with three DR and visualization experts confirmed the guide's significance, comprehensiveness, and usefulness.

Conclusion: The proposed guide effectively aids practitioners in navigating and enhancing their understanding of reliable DR-based visual analytics.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and usefulness of our guide.

TL;DR: Co-creative learning enables humans and AI to integrate partial information and construct shared representations, tested via the MHNG model, showing improved accuracy and shared sign systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of integrating information from different modalities in human-AI interaction, moving beyond unilateral knowledge transfer.

Method: Used the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG) in an online experiment with 69 participants interacting with AI agents under partial observability.

Result: Human-AI pairs with MH-based agents improved categorization accuracy and achieved stronger convergence toward shared sign systems, aligning with MH-derived probabilities.

Conclusion: Co-creative learning via MHNG offers a path for symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, aligning perceptual experiences dynamically.

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI, i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

Result: The network accurately predicted nonlinear distortions, enhancing image quality and diffusion parameter mapping.

Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks outperform linear methods in modeling gradient behavior and correcting errors retrospectively.

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality. Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks. Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

Conclusion: The work advances the understanding of intervention identifiability in time series with abstract causal graphs, offering practical tools for analysis.

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula, and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem, considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is identifiable or not.

### [311] [Digital twin for virtual sensing of ferry quays via a Gaussian Process Latent Force Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14925)
*Luigi Sibille,Torodd Skjerve Nord,Alice Cicirello*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The study applies the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on a ferry quay, combining experimental data with a physics-based model to address challenges like unknown impact forces and sparse sensors. Results show accurate response estimates, though lower accuracy in impact zones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ferry quays deteriorate rapidly due to harsh maritime conditions and impacts. Vibration-based monitoring is limited by sensor placement, necessitating virtual sensing for Digital Twin development.

Method: The study uses a Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrating a reduced-order structural model with GPLFM to estimate unknown impact forces. It addresses challenges like unknown impact characteristics and sparse sensors.

Result: GPLFM provides accurate acceleration estimates at most locations, except impact zones. A numerical study explores optimal sensor placement and sensitivity to factors like sensor type and damping ratios.

Conclusion: GPLFM effectively handles uncertainties, maintaining accuracy in most scenarios, and supports Digital Twin development for ferry quays.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations. Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone. A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types, sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

*Wassim Bouaziz,Mathurin Videau,Nicolas Usunier,El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates indirect data poisoning in LLMs to protect datasets and trace their usage, using gradient-based optimization to teach secret sequences without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tracing data usage in LLMs without relying on memorization, which providers aim to limit.

Method: Uses gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning to teach secret sequences (responses to prompts absent in training data) with minimal token poisoning.

Result: Shows feasibility with less than 0.005% poisoned tokens, achieving high-confidence detection (p < 10^-55) without performance degradation.

Conclusion: Indirect data poisoning is a viable method for dataset protection and usage tracing in LLMs.

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme. Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

### [316] [Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018)
*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm for differentially private continual counting in an unbounded setting, improving error smoothness and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for differentially private continual counting require prior knowledge of input size, limiting their applicability in unbounded settings. The doubling trick workaround leads to suboptimal results.

Method: The authors propose new matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of a known function, enabling smooth error and efficient computation.

Result: The algorithm achieves $O(\log^{2+2α}(t))$ variance, $O(t)$ space, and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, outperforming bounded-input methods. Empirical results show competitive performance.

Conclusion: The novel approach effectively addresses the unbounded setting, offering practical improvements in privacy-preserving continual counting.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $α> 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2α}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights cybersecurity risks in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, emphasizing pre-market security measures to protect patient safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid integration of AI/ML in medical devices introduces cybersecurity risks, threatening patient safety due to potential model mispredictions from cyberattacks.

Method: Analyzes device recalls, adverse events, and vulnerabilities to map threats, then introduces tools for premarket risk assessments.

Result: Proposes tools to help manufacturers embed cybersecurity into AI/ML medical device designs, enhancing safety.

Conclusion: Addressing cybersecurity in the pre-market phase is critical to ensure the safety of AI/ML-enabled medical devices.

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients.

TL;DR: A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is used for jamming detection in 5G-NR networks, outperforming benchmark models with high precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-the-air jamming attacks in 5G-NR networks degrade signal quality, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: Simulated jamming with AWGN on real-world I/Q OFDM datasets; used CAE for detection and CWGAN-GP for dataset balancing.

Result: CAE achieved 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy, outperforming CDAE and CSAE.

Conclusion: CAE is robust for detecting jammed signals in heterogeneous datasets, despite data complexity and class imbalance.

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks, over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

### [319] [deepSURF: Detecting Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Rust Through Fuzzing LLM-Augmented Harnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15648)
*Georgios Androutsopoulos,Antonio Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: deepSURF combines static analysis and LLM-guided fuzzing to detect memory safety bugs in Rust, outperforming existing tools by handling generics and complex APIs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust are limited in capability, struggle with Rust-specific types, or require manual effort.

Method: deepSURF integrates static analysis with LLM-guided fuzzing harness generation, substitutes generics with custom types, and dynamically augments harnesses using LLMs.

Result: Tested on 27 Rust crates, deepSURF rediscovered 20 known bugs and found 6 new vulnerabilities, outperforming state-of-the-art tools.

Conclusion: deepSURF demonstrates significant improvements in detecting memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust, particularly in unsafe code.

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

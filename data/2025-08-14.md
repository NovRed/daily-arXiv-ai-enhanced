### [1] [A Context-aware Attention and Graph Neural Network-based Multimodal Framework for Misogyny Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09175)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Sufyaan Zahoor,Areeb Manzoor,Musharaf Maqbool,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal framework for detecting misogynistic and sexist content on social media, outperforming existing methods by 10.17% and 8.88% on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General offensive content detection struggles with misogynistic content, necessitating tailored solutions for content targeting women.

Method: Proposes a framework with three modules: Multimodal Attention (MANM), Graph-based Feature Reconstruction (GFRM), and Content-specific Features Learning (CFLM), leveraging adaptive attention, graph refinement, and feature learning.

Result: Achieves significant improvements (10.17% and 8.88%) in macro-F1 scores on MAMI and MMHS150K datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the challenge of detecting misogynistic content, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

### [2] [IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09178)
*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1 is a post-training framework for VLMs that enhances anomaly detection in industrial settings through a two-stage training strategy, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection methods are limited by scarce defective samples, and VLMs, despite their generalization capabilities, underperform in industrial anomaly detection.

Method: IAD-R1 uses a two-stage approach: PA-SFT for anomaly perception training with a high-quality dataset (Expert-AD), and SC-GRPO for optimizing anomaly interpretation with reward functions.

Result: IAD-R1 improves average accuracy by up to 43.3% across 7 VLMs on 6 benchmark datasets, outperforming commercial models like GPT-4.1 in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: IAD-R1 effectively enhances VLMs' anomaly detection capabilities, demonstrating superiority and practical applicability in industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [3] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR is a neurosymbolic approach for detecting cognitive attacks in AR, combining neural vision-language models with symbolic reasoning for improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting cognitive attacks in AR lack semantic reasoning or rely on opaque pre-trained models, limiting effectiveness and interpretability.

Method: CADAR fuses multimodal inputs into a symbolic perception-graph, uses salience weighting and temporal correlations, and applies particle-filter based reasoning for attack detection.

Result: CADAR improves detection accuracy by up to 10.7% over baselines in challenging AR attack scenarios.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic approach of CADAR offers effective and interpretable cognitive attack detection in AR.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

### [4] [RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE transforms visual data into privacy-preserving text, balancing accuracy and privacy using MoE and RL, outperforming baselines in security and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the conflict between data utility and privacy in ITS, where existing methods fail to balance both.

Method: Combines Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for scene decomposition and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize text for accuracy and privacy.

Result: Reduces replay attack success to 9.4% on CFP-FP dataset while generating richer text than baselines.

Conclusion: RL-MoE offers a scalable solution for privacy-sensitive AI systems, enhancing security in smart cities and autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

*Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi,S. Younes Mirinezhad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for synthetic depth face generation using optimized GAN with Knowledge Distillation and Genetic Algorithms, outperforming other methods in diversity and quality, achieving high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality, diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions in affective computing.

Method: Uses an optimized GAN with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) for stable training and Genetic Algorithms to evolve GAN latent vectors. Extracts and concatenates LBP, HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features for classification.

Result: Outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in diversity and quality. Achieves 94% and 96% accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation metrics (FID, IS, SSIM, PSNR) show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, diverse synthetic depth faces for emotion recognition, with superior performance in both generation and classification tasks.

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [6] [$Δ$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199)
*Jucheng Hu,Suorong Yang,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

### [7] [Personalized Feature Translation for Expression Recognition: An Efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09202)
*Masoumeh Sharafi,Soufiane Belharbi,Houssem Ben Salem,Ali Etemad,Alessandro Lameiras Koerich,Marco Pedersoli,Simon Bacon,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Personalized Feature Translation (PFT) for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) in facial expression recognition, addressing challenges of subtle expressions and single-class target data by operating in the latent space without image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep FER models struggle with subtle expressions and inter-subject variability. SFDA methods are needed to adapt models without source data, but existing methods aren't designed for single-class target data.

Method: PFT pre-trains a translator on source data to transform style features while preserving expression. It adapts using neutral target data in the latent space, avoiding image synthesis.

Result: PFT produces discriminative embeddings efficiently, reducing computational overhead and avoiding noise from face expression generation.

Conclusion: PFT is a lightweight, efficient SFDA method for FER, eliminating the need for image synthesis and adapting only part of the model.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

TL;DR: C-GAN outperforms Neural Style Transfer and CycleGAN in generating high-quality, human-like colorized anime drawings from sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the costly bottleneck of colorizing sketches in the manga and anime industry.

Method: Evaluated Neural Style Transfer, C-GAN, and CycleGAN for image-to-image translation.

Result: C-GAN produced the highest quality and resolution images, closely resembling human-created ones.

Conclusion: C-GAN is the most effective model for automating colorization in anime and manga production.

Abstract: The process of generating fully colorized drawings from sketches is a large,
usually costly bottleneck in the manga and anime industry. In this study, we
examine multiple models for image-to-image translation between anime characters
and their sketches, including Neural Style Transfer, C-GAN, and CycleGAN. By
assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most
effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images
close to those created by humans.

### [9] [MME-Emotion: A Holistic Evaluation Benchmark for Emotional Intelligence in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09210)
*Fan Zhang,Zebang Cheng,Chong Deng,Haoxuan Li,Zheng Lian,Qian Chen,Huadai Liu,Wen Wang,Yi-Fan Zhang,Renrui Zhang,Ziyu Guo,Zhihong Zhu,Hao Wu,Haixin Wang,Yefeng Zheng,Xiaojiang Peng,Xian Wu,Kun Wang,Xiangang Li,Jieping Ye,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MME-Emotion, a benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in emotional understanding and reasoning, revealing their current limitations and potential improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotional benchmarks for MLLMs lack generalization and reasoning capabilities, prompting the need for a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: MME-Emotion, a benchmark with over 6,000 video clips and QA pairs, is used to assess MLLMs across eight emotional tasks, employing hybrid metrics and a multi-agent system framework.

Result: Evaluation of 20 MLLMs shows unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best model scoring 39.3% in recognition and 56.0% in reasoning. Generalist and specialist models exhibit different strengths.

Conclusion: MME-Emotion aims to advance MLLMs' emotional intelligence by providing a scalable, diverse, and unified evaluation foundation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

### [10] [Towards Effective MLLM Jailbreaking Through Balanced On-Topicness and OOD-Intensity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09218)
*Zuoou Li,Weitong Zhang,Jingyuan Wang,Shuyuan Zhang,Wenjia Bai,Bernhard Kainz,Mengyun Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a four-axis evaluation framework to better assess jailbreak attacks on MLLMs, revealing a trade-off between prompt relevance and novelty. It proposes a recursive rewriting strategy (BSD) that improves attack success and harmfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation standards for jailbreak attacks on MLLMs overestimate effectiveness, as many 'successful' responses are benign or unrelated. A more precise framework is needed to identify truly harmful outputs.

Method: A four-axis framework evaluates input on-topicness, OOD intensity, output harmfulness, and refusal rate. BSD, a recursive rewriting strategy, balances relevance and novelty to evade filters.

Result: BSD improved attack success rates by 67% and harmfulness by 21% across 13 MLLMs, exposing weaknesses in current safety systems.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better safety mechanisms in MLLMs, as BSD demonstrates how balanced prompts can bypass filters and produce harmful outputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

*Haoyang Li,Jiaqing Li,Jialun Cao,Zongyuan Yang,Yongping Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TexTeller, a scalable HMER model trained on Tex80M, the largest formula dataset, achieving SOTA performance by combining limited handwritten data with LaTeX-rendered formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMER faces data scarcity due to costly manual annotation. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging LaTeX-rendered formulas.

Method: Proposes a scalable data engine to generate LaTeX sequences, creating Tex80M. TexTeller is trained by mixing Tex80M with a small HME dataset.

Result: TexTeller achieves SOTA performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The complete model, dataset, and codebase will be openly released to advance HMER research.

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

### [12] [Gradient-Direction-Aware Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09239)
*Zheng Zhou,Yu-Jie Xiong,Chun-Ming Xia,Jia-Chen Zhang,Hong-Jian Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDAGS introduces gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control to address over-reconstruction and over-densification in 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving rendering quality and reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods suffer from over-reconstruction due to persistent large Gaussians and over-densification from redundant Gaussians, increasing memory overhead.

Method: GDAGS uses a gradient coherence ratio (GCR) and nonlinear dynamic weighting to prioritize splitting conflicting-gradient Gaussians and densifying concordant-direction Gaussians.

Result: GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality, reduces memory consumption by 50%, and mitigates over-reconstruction and over-densification.

Conclusion: GDAGS effectively optimizes Gaussian utilization, enhancing scene representation compactness and rendering performance.

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

*Fengxian Ji,Jingpu Yang,Zirui Song,Yuanxi Wang,Zhexuan Cui,Yuke Li,Qian Jiang,Miao Fang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineState-Bench introduces a new evaluation framework for fine-grained GUI agent control, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agent benchmarks focus on coarse-grained tasks, neglecting fine-grained control needed for real-world applications.

Method: Developed FineState-Bench, a multi-platform framework with 2257 tasks, and the Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA) for quantitative analysis.

Result: Top models achieve only 32.8% fine-grained interaction accuracy; ideal visual localization improves success rates by 14.9%.

Conclusion: The primary bottleneck for GUI agents is visual positioning, with FineState-Bench and VDA providing open-source tools for improvement.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

*Jeffri Murrugarra-LLerena,Haoran Niu,K. Suzanne Barber,Hal Daumé III,Yang Trista Cao,Paola Cascante-Bonilla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FiGPriv is a fine-grained privacy protection framework for visual assistant systems, selectively masking high-risk private information while preserving low-risk content, improving usability and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns for blind/low vision users who may unknowingly capture private information in images, overcoming limitations of coarse-grained segmentation methods.

Method: Integrates fine-grained segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism, evaluated using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset.

Result: Preserves +26% of image content, enhances VLM response usefulness by 11%, and improves image content identification by 45% while ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: FiGPriv effectively balances privacy protection and usability, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

### [15] [Harnessing Input-Adaptive Inference for Efficient VLN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09262)
*Dongwoo Kang,Akhil Perincherry,Zachary Coalson,Aiden Gabriel,Stefan Lee,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes input-adaptive methods to enhance efficiency in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) models, reducing computations without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN models are computationally heavy, limiting practical use in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Introduces three adaptive algorithms: selective panoramic view processing, importance-based early-exit thresholding, and a caching mechanism for previously seen views.

Result: Achieves over 2× computation reduction across seven VLN benchmarks without substantial performance degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve efficiency in VLN models, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is

*Alexandre Brown,Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method, leverages SAM and YOLO-World for object-centric decomposition and semantic grounding, achieving superior visual generalization and sample efficiency in RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL struggles with high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards. Existing perception models lack effective integration for visual generalization and sample efficiency.

Method: SegDAC combines SAM for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World for semantic grounding via text prompts. It uses a transformer-based architecture to dynamically focus on segments through online RL, without human labels.

Result: SegDAC doubles prior performance on the hardest visual generalization benchmark (Maniskill3) and matches/surpasses sample efficiency of prior methods.

Conclusion: SegDAC effectively integrates perception models into RL, significantly improving visual generalization and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

*Yifan Jiang,Ahmad Shariftabrizi,Venkata SK. Manem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lung-DDPM+ is an improved generative AI model for lung cancer diagnosis, offering higher efficiency and precision compared to its predecessor and other SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for lung cancer diagnosis are inefficient and anatomically imprecise, limiting clinical use.

Method: Lung-DDPM+ uses a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary DPM-solver.

Result: Achieves 8× fewer FLOPs, 6.8× lower GPU memory, and 14× faster sampling while maintaining sample quality comparable to SOTA models.

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+ effectively generates high-quality thoracic CT images, showing potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

TL;DR: FusionEnsemble-Net, an attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks, improves sign language recognition by fusing visual and motion data, achieving 99.44% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sign language recognition in healthcare requires frameworks to interpret complex multimodal gestures.

Method: Uses RGB video and radar data processed through four spatiotemporal networks with attention-based fusion and ensemble classification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art with 99.44% accuracy on the MultiMeDaLIS dataset.

Conclusion: Attention-based fusion in diverse spatiotemporal networks creates a robust framework for multimodal gesture recognition.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

TL;DR: A dual-architecture framework for CSLR addresses signer variability and unseen sentences, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Isharah-1000 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges like inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel sentence structures in CSLR.

Method: Proposes a Signer-Invariant Conformer for signer independence and a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer for unseen sentences, both using pose-based skeletal keypoints.

Result: Achieves WER of 13.07% (SI) and 47.78% (US), outperforming prior work and ranking high in SignEval 2025.

Conclusion: Task-specific networks for CSLR challenges significantly improve performance, setting a new research baseline.

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

### [22] [What Can We Learn from Inter-Annotator Variability in Skin Lesion Segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09381)
*Kumar Abhishek,Jeremy Kawahara,Ghassan Hamarneh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMA++, a large multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset, and studies variability factors like annotator skill and malignancy. It shows a link between inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and malignancy, predicts IAA from images, and uses IAA to improve segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing variability in medical image segmentation due to ambiguous boundaries and annotator differences, particularly in malignant lesions.

Method: Curated IMA++ dataset, analyzed variability factors, predicted IAA from images, and integrated IAA into a multi-task learning model.

Result: Found a significant link between IAA and malignancy (p<0.001), predicted IAA with 0.108 MAE, and improved segmentation accuracy by 4.2%.

Conclusion: IMA++ and IAA-based multi-task learning enhance segmentation accuracy, offering potential clinical benefits.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

*Guoxian Song,Hongyi Xu,Xiaochen Zhao,You Xie,Tianpei Gu,Zenan Li,Chenxu Zhang,Linjie Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-UniMotion introduces a unified latent representation for whole-body human motion, enabling high-fidelity cross-identity motion transfer from a single image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic adjustments, lacking expressiveness and identity-agnostic capabilities.

Method: A self-supervised framework learns disentangled latent tokens (face, body, hands) alongside a DiT-based generative model, using augmentations and synthetic 3D renderings for motion-identity disentanglement.

Result: X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust, identity-agnostic solution for detailed motion transfer across diverse subjects.

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

TL;DR: DenoDet V2 introduces a novel transform-domain approach for SAR object detection, leveraging amplitude and phase modulation for denoising, outperforming DenoDet V1 with improved accuracy and reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of coherent noise in SAR object detection, existing methods focus on spatial-domain features, but DenoDet V2 explores transform-domain modulation for better performance.

Method: DenoDet V2 uses a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism to enhance phase and amplitude spectra, implemented via a carefully designed attention architecture.

Result: DenoDet V2 achieves a 0.8% improvement on SARDet-100K over DenoDet V1 and reduces model complexity by half, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DenoDet V2 offers a significant advancement in SAR object detection by innovatively modulating transform-domain features, achieving superior results with lower complexity.

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home while preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees.

Method: Motion-triggered IP camera uploads clips to a local server; Detectron2 localizes birds, and EfficientNet-B3 classifies them. System runs on commodity hardware.

Result: High validation performance (99.5%) and practical field accuracy (88% top-1) on held-out species.

Conclusion: Feasible for autonomous, privacy-preserving bird monitoring in urban settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard
bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads
short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for pedestrian interaction understanding in autonomous driving suffer from occlusion and low-quality motion due to reliance on monocular RGB frames.

Method: Utilizes 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance 3D pose sequences extracted from LiDAR point clouds.

Result: The dataset includes over 14,000 seconds of data across 800+ driving scenarios, with rich interactions among up to 250 agents per scene.

Conclusion: Waymo-3DSkelMo serves as a foundational resource for fine-grained human behavior research in urban environments, with benchmarks demonstrating its value.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curb ramps are vital for urban accessibility, but detecting them in images is challenging due to the lack of large, high-quality datasets.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 auto-translates government curb ramp data into annotated GSV panoramas (210,000+ images). Stage 2 trains a modified ConvNeXt V2 model on this dataset.

Result: The dataset achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall; the detection model reaches 0.9236 AP, outperforming prior work.

Conclusion: The work provides the first large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model, advancing urban accessibility.

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

TL;DR: GOAL is a generative flow-based framework for Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav), leveraging LLM-enriched semantic maps to model uncertainty and improve generalization in unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior deterministic models overlook uncertainty in indoor layouts, limiting generalization. GOAL addresses this by incorporating probabilistic modeling and LLM-derived spatial priors.

Method: GOAL uses generative flow-based modeling to bridge observed regions with LLM-enriched semantic maps, encoding spatial priors as Gaussian fields for training.

Result: GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson datasets and shows strong generalization in HM3D transfer settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models semantic distributions and generalizes well, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes
and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Badi-Li/GOAL.

### [30] [What-Meets-Where: Unified Learning of Action and Contact Localization in a New Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09428)
*Yuxiao Wang,Yu Lei,Wolin Liang,Weiying Xue,Zhenao Wei,Nan Zhuang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaIR-Net, a framework for predicting action semantics and body-part contact regions, validated on the PaIR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to jointly model action semantics and spatial contextualization, necessitating a unified approach.

Method: PaIR-Net uses CPAM, PGCS, and IIM modules to predict actions and contact regions, tested on the PaIR dataset.

Result: PaIR-Net outperforms baselines, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Conclusion: The framework advances joint modeling of actions and spatial context, with code and dataset to be released.

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

### [31] [MPT: Motion Prompt Tuning for Micro-Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09446)
*Jiateng Liu,Hengcan Shi,Feng Chen,Zhiwen Shao,Yaonan Wang,Jianfei Cai,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) to adapt large pre-training models for micro-expression recognition (MER), addressing challenges like scarce training samples and subtle motion capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is vital for applications like lie detection and medical diagnosis, but annotation scarcity and the inability of current models to capture subtle motions hinder progress.

Method: MPT includes motion prompt generation (motion magnification and Gaussian tokenization) and a group adapter to enhance large pre-training models for MER.

Result: Experiments on three MER datasets show MPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MPT effectively adapts large models for MER, improving recognition of subtle facial movements.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

*Jiaqi Yan,Shuning Xu,Xiangyu Chen,Dell Zhang,Jie Tang,Gangshan Wu,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RASR introduces a scalable RefSR method by automatically retrieving relevant high-res references, improving practicality and performance over SISR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RefSR methods rely on manually curated image pairs, limiting real-world use. RASR addresses this by automating reference retrieval.

Method: RASR combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator, leveraging semantic similarity and conditioning.

Result: RASRNet outperforms SISR baselines with +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, producing more realistic textures.

Conclusion: Retrieval augmentation bridges the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

*Abdul Matin,Tanjim Bin Faruk,Shrideep Pallickara,Sangmi Lee Pallickara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperKD is a knowledge distillation framework that transfers representations from a simpler teacher model to a student model for hyperspectral imagery, addressing spectral disparities and improving downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of foundation models to hyperspectral remote sensing is challenging due to spectral disparities and limited observations.

Method: HyperKD uses a feature-based strategy with spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function for hyperspectral images.

Result: HyperKD improves representation learning, enhancing reconstruction fidelity and performance on tasks like land cover classification and crop type identification.

Conclusion: HyperKD effectively bridges spectral domain gaps, demonstrating the potential of knowledge distillation in hyperspectral remote sensing analytics.

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

*Shuai Tan,Biao Gong,Zhuoxin Liu,Yan Wang,Xi Chen,Yifan Feng,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Animate-X++ is a universal animation framework for various character types, including anthropomorphic characters, addressing motion modeling and static background limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to human figures and static backgrounds, lacking realism and generalization for anthropomorphic characters.

Method: Proposes Animate-X++ with Pose Indicator for motion representation and multi-task training for background dynamics. Introduces A2Bench for evaluation.

Result: Animate-X++ outperforms existing methods, achieving realistic character animation and dynamic backgrounds.

Conclusion: Animate-X++ is a superior and effective solution for universal character animation.

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

*Junxian Li,Beining Xu,Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAG, a novel input-aware backdoor attack method for VLMs, forcing them to ground specific objects regardless of user queries, with high effectiveness and stealth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security issues in visual grounding tasks for VLMs, particularly backdoor attacks, are underexplored.

Method: IAG uses an adaptive trigger generator with a text-conditional U-Net to embed attack targets into images, minimizing visual discrepancies for stealth.

Result: IAG achieves over 65% ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B and shows potential on other models with minimal accuracy loss on clean samples.

Conclusion: IAG is a robust, transferable attack method, validated by extensive experiments, including ablation studies and defense evaluations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

TL;DR: RelayFormer is a unified architecture for visual manipulation localization (VML) in images and videos, using a Global-Local Relay Attention mechanism for scalable, resolution-agnostic processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VML methods lack cross-modal generalization and struggle with high-resolution or long-duration inputs.

Method: RelayFormer employs flexible local units and GLoRA, integrating with Transformer-based backbones via lightweight adaptation modules. It includes a query-based mask decoder for efficient video inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art localization performance across benchmarks, setting a new baseline for scalable and modality-agnostic VML.

Conclusion: RelayFormer offers a robust, efficient solution for VML with strong generalization and compatibility with existing models.

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

*Hao Yu,Rupayan Mallick,Margrit Betke,Sarah Adel Bargal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEN-AFFECT is a novel framework for generating expressive, identity-consistent 2D avatars using a multimodal diffusion transformer and consistent attention at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and struggle with identity preservation across expressions.

Method: GEN-AFFECT conditions a multimodal diffusion transformer on identity-expression representations and uses consistent attention for identity consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in expression accuracy, identity preservation, and consistency across expressions.

Conclusion: GEN-AFFECT effectively addresses the limitations of current avatar generation methods, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

*Tam Ngoc-Bang Nguyen,Anh-Dzung Doan,Zhipeng Cai,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an energy-efficient robust fitting method using neuromorphic computing, achieving 15% of the energy consumption of traditional CPU-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High energy consumption in AI tasks is a growing concern, and robust fitting in computer vision lacks energy-efficient solutions.

Method: A novel spiking neural network is designed for robust fitting on Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic hardware, using event-driven model estimation and algorithmic strategies to overcome hardware limitations.

Result: The neuromorphic approach consumes only 15% of the energy of standard CPU-based robust fitting while maintaining equivalent accuracy.

Conclusion: Neuromorphic computing offers a promising path for energy-efficient robust fitting in computer vision.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CitySeg is a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation, using text modality for open vocabulary and zero-shot inference, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limited scale of 3D data and domain gaps in existing models to improve generalization in UAV perception systems.

Method: Custom data preprocessing, local-global cross-attention network, hierarchical classification strategy, two-stage training with hinge loss.

Result: Achieves SOTA on nine benchmarks and enables zero-shot generalization without visual info.

Conclusion: CitySeg effectively bridges domain gaps and enhances semantic segmentation for city-scale point clouds.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

*Shibo Yao,Renshuai Tao,Xiaolong Zheng,Chao Liang,Chunjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FTNet, a few-shot training-free method for deepfake detection, improving performance by 8.7% over existing methods by leveraging failed samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of poor generalization in deepfake detection by treating it as a few-shot task, where minimal samples can enhance performance.

Method: FTNet uses one fake sample from an evaluation set, comparing test samples to known fake/real samples without training or parameter updates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an 8.7% average improvement on 29 generative models.

Conclusion: Leveraging failed samples in few-shot scenarios offers a practical solution for real-world deepfake detection.

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) and a tailored data pipeline to improve identity preservation in video generation under large facial angles, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under large facial angles due to ineffective feature integration and lack of targeted dataset coverage.

Method: Proposes MoFE, combining three experts for identity, semantics, and details, and a data pipeline with Face Constraints and Identity Consistency to create the LFA Dataset.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment on the LFA benchmark.

Conclusion: The MoFE and LFA Dataset effectively address identity preservation challenges, with code and dataset made publicly available.

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a universal AI-generated image detector using anomaly detection, trained without AIIs, leveraging proxy images and CLIP encoder for generalizable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limited detection performance of existing AII detectors for unseen generative models by avoiding reliance on AIIs for training.

Method: Uses unsupervised learning with a CLIP encoder and normalizing flow-like model, training on proxy images (spectrally modified natural images) instead of AIIs.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across AIIs from various generators, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust, generalizable solution for detecting AI-generated images without needing access to them during training.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

TL;DR: GazeLT integrates radiologists' gaze patterns into a deep learning framework to improve long-tailed disease classification, outperforming baselines by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists' gaze patterns capture fine-grained and coarse disease information, which can enhance automated image interpretation, especially for long-tailed classes.

Method: GazeLT uses an integration-disintegration mechanism to harness temporal aspects of visual attention, applied to NIH-CXR-LT and MIMIC-CXR-LT datasets.

Result: GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and visual attention baselines by 21.7% in average accuracy.

Conclusion: GazeLT effectively leverages radiologists' gaze for improved long-tailed disease classification, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods are incompatible with RPC models and struggle with multi-temporal satellite images due to geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric inconsistencies.

Method: SkySplat uses RGB images and radiometric-robust relative height supervision, featuring a Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM) and multi-view consistency aggregation.

Result: Achieves 86x speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy, reduces MAE from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on DFC19, and shows strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: SkySplat effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a robust solution for satellite image reconstruction.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

### [45] [Episodic Memory Representation for Long-form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09486)
*Yun Wang,Long Zhang,Jingren Liu,Jiaqi Yan,Zhanjie Zhang,Jiahao Zheng,Xun Yang,Dapeng Wu,Xiangyu Chen,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-EM improves long-form video understanding by modeling keyframes as episodic events, leveraging temporal dynamics and LLM-based reasoning for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-form video understanding oversimplify keyframe retrieval, ignoring spatio-temporal relationships and yielding redundant frames.

Method: Video-EM models keyframes as temporally ordered episodic events, using chain-of-thought reasoning with LLMs to select informative frames.

Result: Video-EM achieves 4-9% performance gains over baselines on benchmarks like Video-MME and LVBench, using fewer frames.

Conclusion: Video-EM effectively addresses limitations of current methods by integrating episodic memory principles and LLM reasoning for robust video understanding.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

### [46] [SARE: Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error for Generalizable Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09487)
*Ju Yeon Kang,Jaehong Park,Semin Kim,Ji Won Yoon,Nam Soo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE) to detect fake images by measuring semantic differences between images and their caption-guided reconstructions, improving robustness across diverse generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods degrade on unseen generative models due to reliance on model-specific artifacts. Fake images tend to align closely with captions, unlike real images.

Method: Introduces SARE, a representation quantifying semantic shifts between images and their caption-guided reconstructions.

Result: SARE outperforms baselines on benchmarks like GenImage and CommunityForensics, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: SARE provides a robust, generalizable solution for detecting fake images across diverse generative models.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

### [47] [CWFBind: Geometry-Awareness for Fast and Accurate Protein-Ligand Docking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09499)
*Liyan Jia,Chuan-Xian Ren,Hong Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWFBind is a deep learning-based docking method that integrates local curvature features and degree-aware weighting to improve accuracy in predicting ligand-protein binding conformations, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning docking methods often neglect geometric information, leading to inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding conformations.

Method: CWFBind uses local curvature descriptors for feature extraction, degree-aware weighting in message passing, and a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy for pocket prediction.

Result: CWFBind achieves competitive performance in docking benchmarks, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: CWFBind provides a more accurate and efficient solution for ligand-protein docking by incorporating geometric and dynamic features.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

*Ajeet Kumar Yadav,Nishant Kumar,Rathna G N*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GAN variant combining ProGAN and SAGAN is proposed to generate high-quality Indian Sign Language images, outperforming ProGAN in IS and FID scores, and a new dataset is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language generation is underexplored, and existing methods lack balance between resolution and detail. The goal is to improve communication for hard-of-hearing individuals.

Method: A modified Attention-based GAN combines ProGAN and SAGAN to generate high-resolution, feature-rich sign language images.

Result: The model outperforms ProGAN with IS and FID improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively, and a new dataset of Indian Sign Language is published.

Conclusion: The proposed GAN variant effectively generates high-quality sign language images, advancing sign language generation and providing a valuable dataset.

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

*Yipei Wang,Shiyu Hu,Shukun Jia,Panxi Xu,Hongfei Ma,Yiping Ma,Jing Zhang,Xiaobo Lu,Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates Similar Object Interference (SOI) in Single Object Tracking (SOT), introduces SOIBench for semantic cognitive guidance, and proposes a VLM-based paradigm for improved tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of SOI in SOT and explore the potential of external cognitive guidance, particularly natural language, to enhance tracking robustness.

Method: Conducts controlled OIM experiments, constructs SOIBench for semantic guidance, and integrates large-scale VLMs as cognitive engines into RGB trackers.

Result: Eliminating SOI improves SOT performance (up to 4.35 AUC gain). VLMs outperform existing VLT methods (up to 0.93 AUC gain).

Conclusion: SOIBench is a valuable benchmark for semantic cognitive tracking, and VLMs offer a promising direction for advancing SOT research.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

*Yuxin Mao,Zhen Qin,Jinxing Zhou,Bin Fan,Jing Zhang,Yiran Zhong,Yuchao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT) with a Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism to enhance Vision Transformers (ViTs) by dynamically adjusting spatial attention based on content and proximity, improving performance on spatially-structured tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs lack explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing methods use fixed spatial decay, limiting adaptability. Inspired by content-aware gating in language models, the authors propose a data-dependent approach for ViTs.

Method: SDT incorporates a novel CAG mechanism for dynamic, data-dependent spatial decay. It combines Manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations in a unified framework.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet-1K show consistent improvements in classification and generation tasks over baselines.

Conclusion: SDT establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in ViTs, addressing limitations of fixed decay methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

*Gang Qu,Ping Wang,Siming Zheng,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and a measurement-aware cross attention (MACA) mechanism to improve measurement incoherence and learn implicit representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack incoherent compressed measurements and implicit measurement representations, limiting performance in image compressed sensing.

Method: Introduces AKCS for better incoherence and MACA for learning implicit representations, integrated into an unfolding network (MEUNet).

Result: MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed AKCS and MACA enhance measurement incoherence and representation learning, leading to superior results in image compressed sensing.

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

*Peiran Peng,Tingfa Xu,Liqiang Song,Mengqi Zhu,Yuqiang Fang,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COXNet improves tiny object detection in RGBT imagery with cross-layer fusion, dynamic alignment, and optimized label assignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 3.32% mAP50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny object detection in RGBT imagery is challenging due to misalignment, low-light, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds, especially in drone-based scenarios. Current methods fail to effectively use complementary information between modalities.

Method: COXNet introduces: 1) Cross-Layer Fusion Module for semantic and spatial accuracy, 2) Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement for correcting misalignments, and 3) GeoShape Similarity Measure for optimized label assignment.

Result: COXNet achieves a 3.32% mAP50 improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset.

Conclusion: COXNet effectively addresses RGBT tiny object detection challenges, proving robust in complex environments.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

### [53] [Iterative Volume Fusion for Asymmetric Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09543)
*Yuanting Gao,Linghao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses stereo matching challenges in asymmetric multi-camera systems by proposing a two-phase network (IVF-AStereo) that fuses cost volumes to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stereo matching algorithms assume symmetric visual properties, but asymmetric systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) disrupt this, complicating matching.

Method: The authors analyze cost volume distortions in asymmetric stereo and propose IVF-AStereo, which refines and fuses two cost volumes iteratively.

Result: IVF-AStereo performs robustly in asymmetric scenarios and outperforms benchmarks, especially with resolution and color degradation.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses visual asymmetry in stereo matching, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoViG introduces a task for generating navigation instructions from egocentric visual data, using a multimodal model with visual forecasting and instruction generation subtasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create adaptable navigation instructions without relying on structured inputs like maps or annotations, improving performance in unseen environments.

Method: Decomposes the task into visual forecasting (predicting intermediate states) and instruction generation, integrated in an autoregressive multimodal model with tailored objectives. Uses one-pass and interleaved reasoning strategies.

Result: Achieves superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores, with robust cross-domain generalization on the R2R-Goal dataset.

Conclusion: GoViG effectively generates precise navigation instructions from raw visual data, demonstrating adaptability and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

*Haowen Wang,Guowei Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Zeyuan Chen,Haiyang Xu,Dou Hoon Kwark,Zhuowen Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using synthetic images from generative models for data augmentation in image classification, comparing their effectiveness to real images and open-set augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if synthetic data from generative models can enhance classification performance and quantify the scale of synthetic data needed for comparable results.

Method: The study compares real and synthetic images, conducts experiments to measure augmentation effectiveness, and quantifies the equivalent scale of synthetic data.

Result: Synthetic data can match real data augmentation if scaled appropriately, with performance varying by dataset size and synthetic data amount.

Conclusion: While real images are preferred, synthetic data augmentation can be effective when properly scaled, offering practical guidelines for its use.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an accurate, compact, and interpretable alternative to deep learning for iris recognition, especially in scenarios with limited data or high explainability needs.

Method: Divides iris images into grids, computes topological invariants (Betti0, Betti1), and uses logistic regression, KNN, and SVM for classification, comparing against a CNN.

Result: Logistic regression achieved 97.78% accuracy, surpassing CNN (96.44%) and other models, with low variance.

Conclusion: Topological invariants offer a robust, explainable, and efficient method for iris recognition, applicable to other fields like medical imaging and interpretable AI.

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

*Jiahao Wen,Hang Yu,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherPrompt improves drone geo-localization under diverse weather by fusing image and text embeddings, achieving better recall rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with weather perturbations due to limited weather categories and poor feature disentanglement.

Method: Uses a training-free weather reasoning mechanism and a dynamic gating framework for multi-modality fusion, optimized by cross-modal objectives.

Result: Boosts Recall@1 by +13.37% (night) and +18.69% (fog/snow) over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt effectively addresses weather-related degradation in drone geo-localization through innovative multi-modality fusion.

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog
and snow conditions.

*Ming Zhao,Pingping Liu,Tongshun Zhang,Zhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes WEC-DG, a wavelet-based method for multi-exposure correction, addressing intra-class variability and exposure consistency with degradation guidance and wavelet transform properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with intra-class variability and exposure consistency in diverse lighting conditions, especially for single-exposure images.

Method: WEC-DG uses a degradation descriptor in ECAM for exposure consistency and EDRM for light-detail decoupling via wavelet transform.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on public datasets, improving exposure correction and detail recovery.

Conclusion: WEC-DG is effective and practical for multi-exposure correction under complex conditions.

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its

### [59] [A Chain of Diagnosis Framework for Accurate and Explainable Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09566)
*Haibo Jin,Haoxuan Che,Sunan He,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a trustworthy radiology report generation (RRG) framework called Chain of Diagnosis (CoD) to improve clinical accuracy and explainability by generating QA pairs, grounding diagnoses, and leveraging omni-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RRG models lack clinical efficacy and explainability, making it hard for radiologists to trust results. The paper aims to address these issues by ensuring accurate descriptions and providing prediction bases.

Method: The CoD framework generates QA pairs via diagnostic conversation, uses a large language model for accurate report generation, and includes diagnosis and lesion grounding modules for explainability. Omni-supervised learning is used for efficient training.

Result: CoD outperforms specialist and generalist models on RRG benchmarks, provides explainable results by grounding sentences to QA diagnoses and images, and introduces a new dataset and evaluation tool.

Conclusion: The CoD framework successfully improves RRG by enhancing accuracy, explainability, and radiologist efficiency, supported by extensive experiments and new resources.

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

*Jiwon Kim,Pureum Kim,SeonHwa Kim,Soobin Park,Eunju Cha,Kyong Hwan Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF) system improves controllable text-to-image models by refining latents to better reflect appearance and user intent, enabling fine-grained generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with spatial structure preservation and fine-grained condition capture, like object poses and scene layouts.

Method: DRF uses appearance and generation feedback to recursively refine intermediate latents, integrating structural and appearance attributes.

Result: The method produces high-quality, semantically coherent, and structurally consistent images, even for class-invariant tasks like motion transfer.

Conclusion: DRF effectively addresses limitations in current controllable T2I models without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is

*Bei Yan,Zhiyuan Chen,Yuecong Min,Jie Zhang,Jiahao Wang,Xiaozhen Wang,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHALE, a scalable benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), addressing limitations of prior studies by automating data construction and providing fine-grained analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucinations (faithfulness and factuality inconsistencies), but existing evaluations are coarse, lack scalability, and rely on manual curation.

Method: Proposes an automated data pipeline for scalable, diverse evaluation and a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input perturbations.

Result: SHALE includes 30K+ image-instruction pairs across 12 visual aspects and 6 knowledge domains, revealing significant factuality hallucinations and model sensitivity to perturbations.

Conclusion: SHALE offers a robust, scalable solution for fine-grained hallucination evaluation in LVLMs, highlighting their vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve radar detection annotation accuracy and tracking performance in autonomous driving under varying supervision levels.

Method: Uses Bayesian tracking, smoothing, and fusion methods for trajectory and shape estimation, with optional manual label integration for continuous improvement.

Result: Evaluated in urban scenarios, showing functionality across dynamic objects and class types with measurable tracking and annotation performance.

Conclusion: BAAS effectively enhances radar detection annotation and tracking, adaptable for continuous improvement with manual data.

Abstract: This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and
fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous
driving. Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and
eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories
along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level
under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides
evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or
combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The
framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We
demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic
objects and class types

### [63] [COME: Dual Structure-Semantic Learning with Collaborative MoE for Universal Lesion Detection Across Heterogeneous Ultrasound Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09886)
*Lingyu Chen,Yawen Zeng,Yue Wang,Peng Wan,Guo-chen Ning,Hongen Liao,Daoqiang Zhang,Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes COME, a framework for multi-heterogeneous ultrasound datasets to mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving discriminative features, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of single-dataset training in ultrasound image analysis due to data scarcity and noise, the need for a universal framework is highlighted.

Method: COME uses dual structure-semantic shared experts and collaborates with source-specific experts to extract discriminative features, leveraging cross-dataset distributions.

Result: COME achieves significant improvements in mean AP across single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ evaluations.

Conclusion: COME provides a robust solution for universal ultrasound image analysis, enhancing generalization and performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

*Haotian Tang,Jianwei Chen,Xinrui Tang,Yunjia Wu,Zhengyang Miao,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework, improves IDH mutation prediction in glioma by integrating structural and morphological connectomes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting IDH mutation status in glioma are limited by low-quality functional MRI and neglect of the brain's hierarchical organization.

Method: Hi-SMGNN combines structural and morphological connectomes using a Siamese network, cross-modal attention, multiscale feature fusion, and personalized modular partitioning.

Result: Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models on the UCSF-PDGM dataset, showing better robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN offers a superior, interpretable, and non-invasive approach for IDH mutation prediction in glioma.

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

*Junyan Ye,Dongzhi Jiang,Zihao Wang,Leqi Zhu,Zhenghao Hu,Zilong Huang,Jun He,Zhiyuan Yan,Jinghua Yu,Hongsheng Li,Conghui He,Weijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4o's synthetic images complement rare scenarios and provide clean supervision, leading to the creation of Echo-4o-Image dataset and improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of real-world datasets (e.g., rare scenarios, noise) by leveraging GPT-4o's synthetic data advantages.

Method: Developed Echo-4o-Image, a 180K synthetic dataset, and fine-tuned Bagel model. Introduced GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench for evaluation.

Result: Echo-4o outperforms on benchmarks and improves other models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) via transferability.

Conclusion: Synthetic data from GPT-4o effectively enhances open-source models, offering better coverage and alignment than real-world data alone.

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

*Heyi Sun,Cong Wang,Tian-Xing Xu,Jingwei Huang,Di Kang,Chunchao Guo,Song-Hai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVG-Head introduces a hybrid representation for head avatars, combining surface and volumetric Gaussians for high-fidelity rendering and real-time appearance editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of editable head avatars in AR/VR, particularly real-time appearance editing, due to implicit representations and entangled geometry-appearance modeling.

Method: Uses surface Gaussians for explicit appearance modeling with texture images and volumetric Gaussians for non-Lambertian regions. Includes mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping and hierarchical optimization.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity rendering and real-time appearance editing, demonstrated on the NeRSemble dataset.

Conclusion: SVG-Head is the first method to provide explicit textures for Gaussian head avatars, enabling real-time editing without compromising quality.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

*Jie Shao,Ke Zhu,Minghao Fu,Guo-hua Wang,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaME improves perceptual quality in diffusion models by using an image quality assessment model to guide sampling away from low-quality regions, without harming FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art diffusion models often produce distorted or low-quality images despite good FID scores, due to FID's focus on global distribution alignment over individual sample quality. CFG, while helpful, can introduce artifacts.

Method: FaME leverages an image quality assessment model to detect low-quality generations and uses their sampling trajectories as negative guidance to avoid poor-quality regions during future sampling.

Result: FaME consistently enhances visual quality on ImageNet without degrading FID scores and shows potential for text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: FaME offers a training-free, inference-efficient solution to improve perceptual quality in diffusion models, addressing limitations of current metrics and techniques like CFG.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

*Beomjun Kim,Suhan Woo,Sejong Heo,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BridgeTA introduces a cost-effective distillation framework to improve camera-only BEV map segmentation by bridging the gap with LiDAR-Camera fusion models using a lightweight Teacher Assistant network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-only BEV segmentation lags behind LiDAR-Camera fusion methods. Existing KD methods increase inference costs by mimicking teacher architectures.

Method: BridgeTA uses a Teacher Assistant network to create a shared latent space between teacher and student, with a distillation loss derived from Young's Inequality.

Result: Achieves 4.2% mIoU improvement over camera-only baselines, outperforming other KD methods by up to 45%.

Conclusion: BridgeTA effectively bridges the performance gap without increasing inference costs, offering a practical solution for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

TL;DR: MInDI-3D is a 3D conditional diffusion model for sparse-view CBCT artefact removal, reducing radiation exposure. It extends 2D InDI to 3D, uses iterative denoising, and trains on a large pseudo-CBCT dataset. Evaluations show significant PSNR gains, 8x radiation reduction, and clinician approval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce radiation exposure in CBCT imaging by improving sparse-view artefact removal using a 3D approach.

Method: Extends 2D InDI to 3D with iterative denoising, trains on a pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182 volumes), and evaluates with quantitative metrics, scalability tests, and clinician assessments.

Result: Achieves 12.96 dB PSNR gain, 8x radiation reduction, matches 3D U-Net performance, and generalizes to new scanner geometries. Clinicians approve for patient positioning and tumor boundary preservation.

Conclusion: MInDI-3D effectively reduces CBCT radiation exposure while maintaining image quality, validated by clinical and quantitative assessments.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

### [70] [Plane Detection and Ranking via Model Information Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09625)
*Daoxin Zhong,Jun Li,Meng Yee Michael Chuah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalized framework for plane detection using model information optimization is proposed to address RANSAC's susceptibility to false positives in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RANSAC's inlier threshold ambiguity leads to false positives in plane detection, especially in complex scenes with unknown plane counts.

Method: Treat depth readings as discrete random variables, generate models with candidate plane constraints, and optimize for the least informative model to determine ground truth.

Result: The framework improves plane parameter accuracy over RANSAC and ranks plane quality by information reduction.

Conclusion: The method outperforms RANSAC in accuracy and is enhanced by neural network segmentation for real-world data.

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

TL;DR: SAD-Splat is a novel 3D-AVS-SS method that improves segmentation accuracy by eliminating ambiguous Gaussian points and using pseudo-labels from 2D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with semantic ambiguity due to scale variations and occlusions in aerial images, limiting accuracy.

Method: Introduces a Gaussian point drop module with semantic confidence estimation and a pseudo-label generation pipeline using 2D foundation models.

Result: Achieves a balance between segmentation accuracy and compactness, validated on the new 3D-AS dataset.

Conclusion: SAD-Splat provides an efficient, scalable solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a texture module for monocular 3D hand reconstruction, using texture alignment as a supervisory signal to improve accuracy and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Texture alignment is often imperfect in existing models, suggesting it could be a valuable but underused cue for pose and shape estimation.

Method: A lightweight texture module embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space, enabling a dense alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. It integrates with differentiable rendering and existing reconstruction pipelines.

Result: The approach improves both accuracy and realism in hand reconstruction when tested with HaMeR, a transformer-based model.

Conclusion: Texture-guided supervision enhances hand reconstruction, demonstrating the value of appearance-based alignment.

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video
abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible,
well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models
demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid
video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to
represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce
Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative
planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across
five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

*Shengjun Zhu,Siyu Liu,Runqing Xiong,Liping Zheng,Duo Ma,Rongshang Chen,Jiaxin Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Multi-Contrast Fusion Module (MCFM) improves fetal torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging by enhancing feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of fetal torso planes in ultrasound is crucial for prenatal care, but low contrast and unclear textures hinder fine-grained recognition.

Method: MCFM processes raw ultrasound data in lower neural network layers, using attention weights for multi-contrast conditions to enhance feature modeling.

Result: MCFM improves recognition performance and classification accuracy while maintaining low model complexity.

Conclusion: MCFM offers a clinically viable solution for more accurate prenatal diagnoses, with potential for widespread adoption.

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

*Zhongyuan Wu,Chuan-Xian Ren,Yu Wang,Xiaohua Ban,Jianning Xiao,Xiaohui Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PG-SAM integrates expert domain knowledge and cross-sequence attention to improve parotid gland lesion segmentation, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation is challenging due to variable lesion sizes and complex boundaries, and current methods lack expert domain knowledge.

Method: PG-SAM uses expert diagnosis text to generate prompts, a cross-sequence attention module for multi-modal integration, and a decoder for segmentation.

Result: PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three clinical centers, proving its clinical applicability.

Conclusion: PG-SAM effectively leverages expert knowledge and multi-modal data for superior parotid gland lesion segmentation.

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge, which aims to improve intraoperative image guidance for brain tumor surgery by addressing brain shift using multimodal registration of MRI and ultrasound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain shift during surgery reduces the accuracy of neuronavigation systems based on preoperative MRI. Aligning intraoperative ultrasound with MRI can restore accuracy, but it's challenging due to anatomical changes and modality differences.

Method: The challenge provides a large benchmark dataset (99 training, 5 validation, 10 test cases) of paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection iUS volumes. Performance is evaluated using annotated landmarks and metrics like TRE, TRE30, and runtime.

Result: The ReMIND2Reg Challenge establishes a standardized framework to evaluate and improve multimodal registration algorithms for neurosurgery.

Conclusion: The challenge aims to advance robust, generalizable, and clinically deployable algorithms for image-guided neurosurgery.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

*Lianfang Wang,Kuilin Qin,Xueying Liu,Huibin Chang,Yong Wang,Yuping Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parameterized inverse problem framework for 3D NLOS imaging uses noise estimation and a neural operator for robust, accurate reconstruction, enhanced by global-local feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLOS imaging faces challenges due to weak, noisy indirect signals; this work aims to improve reconstruction accuracy and robustness.

Method: Combines noise estimation, a parameterized neural operator for inverse mapping, and deep algorithm unfolding for interpretability and adaptability. Introduces global-local spatiotemporal feature fusion.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance on simulated and real datasets, especially with fast scanning and sparse illumination data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios, balancing speed, accuracy, and adaptability.

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

*Eduarda Caldeira,Naser Damer,Fadi Boutros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegFaceDiff introduces negative conditions in identity-conditioned diffusion models to improve identity separability in synthetic face data, enhancing face recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses identity overlap in synthetic face data generated by current methods, which leads to suboptimal face recognition performance.

Method: Proposes NegFaceDiff, a sampling method incorporating negative conditions to guide the diffusion process away from unwanted features while maintaining intra-class consistency.

Result: Significantly improves identity separability (FDR increases from 2.427 to 5.687) and enhances face recognition performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff effectively mitigates identity overlap in synthetic data, improving its utility for training robust face recognition systems.

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

*Xingyilang Yin,Qi Zhang,Jiahao Chang,Ying Feng,Qingnan Fan,Xi Yang,Chi-Man Pun,Huaqi Zhang,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSFixer improves 3DGS reconstruction from sparse views using a reference-guided video restoration model, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse views in 3DGS reconstruction lead to artifacts; existing generative priors fail to maintain consistency with inputs.

Method: Uses a DiT-based video diffusion model with 2D/3D reference features for artifact restoration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: GSFixer effectively enhances 3DGS quality from sparse inputs, validated by the new DL3DV-Res benchmark.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach using an invertible Neural Radiance Field (InvNeRF) for 2D and 3D point tracking in surgical scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point tracking methods struggle with consistent motion or are limited to 2D. The paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging a NeRF-based architecture for improved tracking.

Method: Proposes InvNeRF for bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference, and efficient pixel sampling. Supervises reprojection of pixel correspondences.

Result: Outperforms TTO state-of-the-art by nearly 50% in 2D tracking and is the first TTO approach for 3D tracking, surpassing feed-forward methods.

Conclusion: The InvNeRF-based TTO approach effectively improves precision and accuracy in both 2D and 3D point tracking, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PaCo-FR is an unsupervised framework for facial representation pre-training, addressing challenges like feature capture, spatial structure, and data efficiency. It combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing fine-grained facial features, ignoring spatial structure, and inefficient use of labeled data.

Method: PaCo-FR integrates structured masking, a patch-based codebook, and spatial consistency constraints to enhance feature discrimination and preserve facial geometry.

Result: The method achieves top performance in facial analysis tasks, even with varying poses, occlusions, and lighting, using only 2 million unlabeled images.

Conclusion: PaCo-FR advances facial representation learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution that reduces reliance on annotated datasets.

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

TL;DR: SAFF uses slot attention to filter irrelevant features in few-shot learning, improving classification by focusing on meaningful similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irrelevant features degrade few-shot learning performance, causing confusion and misclassification.

Method: SAFF integrates slot attention with patch embeddings to filter weak features and uses a similarity matrix for relevance quantification.

Result: SAFF outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet, and tieredImageNet.

Conclusion: Slot attention effectively filters irrelevant features, enhancing few-shot learning performance.

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma

TL;DR: MangaDiT improves reference-guided line art colorization using Diffusion Transformers and hierarchical attention for better color consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack region-level color consistency when reference and target images differ in pose or motion.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformers (DiT) with hierarchical attention and dynamic weighting to implicitly discover semantic correspondences.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, achieving superior qualitative and quantitative results.

Conclusion: MangaDiT enhances color alignment and consistency without external annotations, setting a new standard for reference-guided colorization.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address storage and transmission challenges of medical imaging data in resource-limited clinical settings.

Method: Uses cross-attention scores from a vision-language model to prune diagnostically critical regions of chest X-rays, creating a compressed graph representation fused with a knowledge graph.

Result: Achieves 93.4-97.7% reduction in image data size with 0.88-0.95 AUC for pneumonia detection, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

TL;DR: A sheaf-based framework for fusing MRI and histopathology data improves glioblastoma subtype classification, outperforming baseline methods and handling missing data robustly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current glioblastoma subtype classification relies on invasive tissue extraction, and existing multimodal fusion methods lack robust structural preservation and handling of incomplete data.

Method: Proposes a sheaf-based framework for structure-aware fusion of MRI and histopathology data, addressing limitations in discriminative feature retention and missing modality handling.

Result: The model outperforms baseline methods and shows robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework advances virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics, with potential clinical impact.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Result: Outperforms baseline architectures in accuracy, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and enables fault detection with sub-pixel precision.

Conclusion: The pipeline advances the certification potential of vision-based systems for safety-critical aviation applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous
navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and
runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Result: M3-Agent outperforms baselines (Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o) by 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long, respectively.

Conclusion: M3-Agent advances multimodal agents with human-like memory, offering practical insights and outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

*Zhiqiu Zhang,Dongqi Fan,Mingjie Wang,Qiang Tang,Jian Yang,Zili Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Region-to-Region (R2R) transformation for image harmonization, addressing detail preservation and dataset limitations with Clear-VAE and MACA, and introduces a new synthetic dataset, RPHarmony.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LDM-based harmonization struggles with detail preservation and lacks realistic datasets, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes R2R with Clear-VAE for detail preservation and MACA for dynamic adjustment, plus Random Poisson Blending for dataset creation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in metrics and visual harmony, with RPHarmony enhancing realism.

Conclusion: R2R and RPHarmony advance harmonization, with open access to code, dataset, and model weights.

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MoIIE, a sparse Mixture of Experts architecture for LVLMs, improving efficiency and performance by routing tokens to intra- and inter-modality experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational costs of dense LVLMs and challenges in applying MoE to multi-modal tasks.

Method: Introduces MoIIE with modality-guided expert routing and a two-stage training strategy.

Result: MoIIE models (5.5B/11.3B) match/surpass larger MoE-LLMs in performance.

Conclusion: MoIIE is effective, efficient, and generalizable for multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

*Nahyuk Lee,Juhong Min,Junhong Lee,Chunghyun Park,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new shape-matching method, combinative matching, is introduced for geometric assembly by modeling 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy,' outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on identical surfaces for alignment, but interlocking parts require modeling both identical surfaces and opposite volumes.

Method: The method learns correspondences between regions with identical surfaces but opposite volumes, using equivariant neural networks to align regions by rotation.

Result: The approach reduces local ambiguities and robustly combines parts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combinative matching effectively addresses interlocking shape assembly by modeling surface and volume properties, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSS-Prompt introduces a method using static and dynamic prompts with Vision Transformers for few-shot class-incremental learning, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) by leveraging pre-trained models without forgetting old concepts.

Method: Uses static prompts for domain adaptation and dynamic prompts for instance-aware semantics, generated via a multi-modal model.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks, alleviating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt is a simple yet effective solution for FSCIL, demonstrating strong performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

*Yingjie Wang,Zhixing Wang,Le Zheng,Tianxiao Liu,Roujing Li,Xueyao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeMoSORT is a real-time MOT tracker addressing motion mismatch and occlusion issues with Memory-assisted Kalman filter and Motion-adaptive IoU, achieving top performance on DanceTrack and SportsMOT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional tracking-by-detection methods, which struggle with motion mismatches and occlusions.

Method: Introduces Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) for motion compensation and Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) for adaptive matching.

Result: Achieves HOTA scores of 67.9% (DanceTrack) and 82.1% (SportsMOT), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MeMoSORT effectively addresses MOT challenges with innovative, lightweight solutions, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

*Xin Du,Maoyuan Xu,Zhi Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUJICA enhances PBR material upscaling by integrating cross-map attention into pre-trained SISR models, improving performance and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods for PBR materials face issues like cross-map inconsistency and limited generalization, necessitating a better solution.

Method: MUJICA adapts pre-trained Swin-transformer-based SISR models using cross-map attention to fuse features while preserving reconstruction ability.

Result: MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores, maintains cross-map consistency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MUJICA efficiently trains with limited resources and outperforms existing methods for PBR material super-resolution.

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (U-Net) automates segmentation of brain tissue in photographs, achieving high accuracy comparable to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of brain tissue in photographs is costly; automation is needed for efficiency.

Method: U-Net trained on 1,414 manually segmented images and 2,000 synthetic images for generalizability.

Result: Model achieved Dice score >0.98, mean surface distance <0.4mm, and 95% Hausdorff distance <1.60mm.

Conclusion: The tool is highly accurate and publicly available, approaching inter-/intra-rater variability levels.

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRACE models 3D scene dynamics from videos without labels, using rigid particles to learn physics parameters for motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motion physics without additional labels. TRACE aims to learn these dynamics directly from videos.

Method: TRACE formulates 3D points as rigid particles, learning translation and rotation dynamics with explicit physical parameters.

Result: TRACE outperforms baselines in future frame extrapolation and enables easy object segmentation via clustering physical parameters.

Conclusion: TRACE effectively models complex 3D scene dynamics without labels, offering strong performance and segmentation capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

*Aryan Pandhi,Shrey Baid,Sanjali Jha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the persistent issue of elephant poaching in Africa, highlighting the shift in poaching hotspots and the need for a Computer Vision (CV) model to identify these areas using geographic indicators and satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the alarming rise in elephant poaching, especially in remote areas where traditional anti-poaching efforts are ineffective, and the need for an efficient, non-intrusive method to monitor large regions.

Method: The proposed method involves using a Computer Vision Model to analyze geographic indicators (like watering holes, seasons, altitude) and satellite imagery to dynamically identify poaching hotspots.

Result: The CV model can efficiently survey large areas without disturbing wildlife or violating aviation restrictions, addressing the limitations of manual tracking and resource deployment.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating CV with satellite imagery offers a scalable and effective solution to combat elephant poaching by dynamically identifying and monitoring poaching hotspots.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's alignment with low-level human image quality peaks early in training, then declines due to shifts from texture to shape bias and noise sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why CLIP's correlation with human image quality assessments peaks early and declines later.

Method: Investigates shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy under noise.

Result: CLIP initially learns low-level features (aligned with human perception) but shifts to abstract shapes, improving robustness but reducing low-level alignment.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a trade-off between perceptual alignment and robustness, offering insights for optimizing vision-language models.

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

TL;DR: ViMoNet combines motion and video data for better human behavior understanding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent models focus only on motion or video data, missing nuanced human actions. Combining both types is essential.

Method: ViMoNet uses joint training with motion-text and video-text data, leveraging precision and comprehensiveness. A new dataset, VIMOS, and benchmark, ViMoNet-Bench, are introduced.

Result: ViMoNet excels in caption generation, motion understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Conclusion: ViMoNet effectively captures human behavior nuances by integrating motion and video data, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Motivation: Addresses the scarcity of manipulation data by leveraging pretrained large models from other modalities, specifically video generation, to understand physical dynamics.

Method: Proposes PAR, which uses autoregressive video generation models to represent joint evolution of robots and environments. It employs a DiT-based de-tokenizer, causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and KV-cache for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 100% success on PushCube task, matches action-pretrained baselines, and predicts future videos with aligned action trajectories.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of transferring world knowledge from video pretraining to robotics, offering a promising direction for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

*Xuhong Huang,Shiqi Liu,Kai Zhang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator to address the lack of a true inverse for convolution in neural networks, proposing ConverseNet for image restoration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transposed convolution doesn't truly reverse convolution, limiting neural network design. The paper aims to fill this gap with a mathematically sound reverse operator.

Method: The authors formulate a regularized least-squares problem to create a depthwise reverse convolution operator, integrating it into a Transformer-like block for ConverseNet.

Result: ConverseNet variants outperform traditional models (DnCNN, SRResNet, USRNet) in Gaussian denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring.

Conclusion: The proposed reverse convolution operator is effective and could inspire new deep learning operators.

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

Motivation: Existing coordinate-based methods for 3D surface reconstruction are computationally intensive. RayletDF aims to simplify this by directly predicting surface points from rays.

Method: The pipeline includes a raylet feature extractor, a raylet distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender to extract features, predict distances, and blend predictions for precise surface reconstruction.

Result: Evaluated on public datasets, RayletDF shows superior performance and generalization, accurately reconstructing surfaces in a single-forward pass on unseen data.

Conclusion: RayletDF is an efficient and generalizable solution for 3D surface reconstruction from point clouds or 3D Gaussians.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

*Hao Yang,Xu Zhang,Jiaqi Ma,Linwei Zhu,Yun Zhang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph neural network-based OIQA framework is proposed to better evaluate locally non-uniform distortions in omnidirectional images by modeling spatial relationships between viewports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OIQA methods fail to adequately assess locally non-uniform distortions due to poor modeling of spatial quality variations and ineffective feature representation.

Method: The framework uses Fibonacci sphere sampling for viewport generation, multi-stage feature extraction, and combines Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a graph transformer to capture local and long-range spatial dependencies.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on large-scale OIQA databases, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses spatial distortion non-uniformity in omnidirectional images, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on CelebAMask-HQ, comparing UNet and DiT architectures, and exploring LoRA-based fine-tuning. Key contributions include InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and SegFormer-based segmentation encoder, improving controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance diffusion models for controlled face generation in limited data settings, focusing on semantic alignment and controllability.

Method: Comparison of UNet and DiT for unconditional generation; LoRA-based fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion; integration of InfoNCE loss and SegFormer-based segmentation encoder for conditional pipelines.

Result: Improved semantic alignment and controllability in attribute-guided face generation, demonstrating effectiveness of contrastive embedding and advanced segmentation encoding.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements, particularly InfoNCE loss and SegFormer-based encoder, significantly improve controlled face generation in small-scale datasets.

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a
small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and
conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for
unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained
Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARI3D is a software tool designed to assist in the interactive analysis of 3D X-ray CT images, improving phase identification, addressing partial volume effects, and enhancing quantification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome imaging artifacts like beam hardening and partial volume effects in 3D X-ray CT for accurate microstructure analysis.

Method: Proposes ARI3D, a software tool for interactive analysis, following a protocol to classify and quantify objects in 3D images.

Result: ARI3D improves phase identification, handles partial volume effects, and increases quantification accuracy.

Conclusion: ARI3D harmonizes quantitative 3D analysis across scientific fields, addressing key challenges in microstructure imaging.

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Larger Vision Transformers (ViTs) show lower perceptual alignment with humans. Dataset diversity has little effect, but repeated exposure to images reduces alignment. Strong data augmentation and regularization worsen alignment, especially in repeatedly trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how ViTs align with human perception and how factors like model size, dataset size, and training strategies impact this alignment.

Method: Systematic analysis of ViTs on the TID2013 dataset, varying model size, dataset size, data augmentation, and regularization.

Result: Larger models have lower perceptual alignment. Repeated image exposure and strong augmentation/regularization reduce alignment. Dataset diversity has minimal impact.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between model complexity, training strategies, and human-like perceptual alignment, important for applications needing human-like vision.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

*Yupeng Zhou,Zhen Li,Ziheng Ouyang,Yuming Chen,Ruoyi Du,Daquan Zhou,Bin Fu,Yihao Liu,Peng Gao,Ming-Ming Cheng,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OneVAE enhances discrete video VAEs by leveraging continuous VAE priors, achieving faster convergence and superior performance with structural improvements like multi-token quantization and first-frame reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete video VAEs face unstable training, long training times, and poor reconstruction quality. Continuous VAEs perform better, so the goal is to bridge the gap between discrete and continuous representations.

Method: Uses FSQ to preserve continuous VAE priors, introduces multi-token quantization for better PSNR, and strengthens first-frame reconstruction. Also proposes a joint discrete-continuous optimization scheme.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, superior performance, and competitive results in both discrete and continuous representations within a single network (OneVAE).

Conclusion: OneVAE successfully unifies discrete and continuous video representations, improving efficiency and performance in video encoding.

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumanGenesis addresses geometric inconsistency and motion generalization in synthetic human dynamics by integrating geometric and generative modeling through four collaborative agents, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with geometric inconsistency, coarse reconstruction, motion generalization limitations, and scene inharmonization in generating photorealistic human motion videos.

Method: HumanGenesis uses four agents: Reconstructor (3D Gaussian Splatting), Critique Agent (MLLM-based refinement), Pose Guider (time-aware parametric encoders), and Video Harmonizer (hybrid rendering with diffusion).

Result: The framework excels in text-guided synthesis, video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, improving expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Conclusion: HumanGenesis significantly advances synthetic human dynamics by combining geometric and generative modeling, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-4DGS is an event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting method for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams, addressing limitations of RGB cameras in high-speed and low-light scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB cameras have limitations like lighting dependence and motion blur. Event cameras offer advantages like high temporal resolution and dynamic range, making them suitable for challenging scenes.

Method: Proposes E-4DGS with event-based initialization, event-adaptive slicing splatting, intensity importance pruning, and adaptive contrast threshold for precise optimization. Uses a synthetic multi-view event camera setup.

Result: Outperforms event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in rapid scene capture.

Conclusion: E-4DGS advances multi-view event-based reconstruction, offering a new approach for high-speed and low-light scenarios.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel audio-visual speech representation learning method for detecting face forgery videos, improving cross-dataset generalization and robustness without using fake videos in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in detecting face forgery videos, especially generalizing to unseen datasets and perturbations. Audio signals, rich in speech content, can reflect facial movements, motivating the use of audio-visual synergy.

Method: Learn audio-visual speech representations on real videos via self-supervised masked prediction, encoding local and global semantic information. Transfer this model to forgery detection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without training on fake videos.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages audio-visual speech representations for superior forgery detection, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Motivation: Existing methods for cell detection, segmentation, and classification in tumor microenvironments perform poorly on understudied cell types and lack cross-domain generalization.

Method: HistoPLUS is trained on a curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. It is validated across 4 independent cohorts.

Result: HistoPLUS outperforms current models by 5.2% in detection quality and 23.7% in F1 classification score, using 5x fewer parameters. It also enables the study of 7 understudied cell types and improves performance on 8 of 13 cell types.

Conclusion: HistoPLUS advances cell analysis in tumor microenvironments, offering improved performance, efficiency, and broader applicability, with model weights and code publicly released.

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing
tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing
methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not
present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell
analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei
covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model
weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in digitizing historical manuscripts with small, author-specific collections motivate the need for effective HTG to improve HTR performance.

Method: Systematic comparison of three HTG models (GAN, diffusion, autoregressive) to assess their impact on HTR fine-tuning, analyzing visual and linguistic characteristics of synthetic data.

Result: Provides quantitative guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model and insights into current HTG capabilities.

Conclusion: HTG methods show promise for low-resource HTR but require further improvements in their application.

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AST-n accelerates LDCT denoising using diffusion models, reducing steps and maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT reduces radiation but increases noise; diffusion models can improve image quality.

Method: AST-n starts reverse diffusion mid-process and uses high-order ODE solvers to cut steps.

Result: AST-25 achieves PSNR >38 dB and SSIM >0.95, reducing time from ~16s to <1s per slice.

Conclusion: AST-n enables fast, high-quality LDCT reconstruction, making diffusion methods clinically viable.

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: Off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models are adapted for visual in-context learning (V-ICL) without fine-tuning, achieving strong performance across six vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and generalize visual in-context learning by avoiding specialized training or extra data, leveraging existing Stable Diffusion models.

Method: In-place attention re-computation in Stable Diffusion's self-attention layers to incorporate context between queries and example prompts.

Result: Improves mIoU for foreground segmentation by 8.9% and 3.2% over Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively, and adapts well to multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Stable Diffusion can be effectively repurposed for V-ICL, demonstrating versatility and performance without additional training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise and interpretable facial dynamics transfer from driving videos to source portraits, addressing limitations of prior 'warp-render' approaches.

Method: LIA-X employs an autoencoder with a Sparse Motion Dictionary, modeling motion transfer as linear navigation in latent space for disentangled, interpretable factors.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in self- and cross-reenactment tasks, scalable to 1B parameters, and supports fine-grained editing applications.

Conclusion: LIA-X offers superior interpretability and control for facial dynamics transfer, enabling practical applications in image/video editing and 3D-aware manipulation.

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

### [119] [PERSONA: Personalized Whole-Body 3D Avatar with Pose-Driven Deformations from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09973)
*Geonhee Sim,Gyeongsik Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PERSONA combines 3D-based and diffusion-based approaches to create personalized 3D human avatars from a single image, using balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for animatable human avatars either require costly pose-rich videos (3D-based) or struggle with identity preservation (diffusion-based). PERSONA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PERSONA generates pose-rich videos from a single image using diffusion, then optimizes a 3D avatar with balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization.

Result: The framework achieves high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses while preserving identity.

Conclusion: PERSONA successfully integrates the strengths of 3D and diffusion approaches, enabling practical avatar creation from minimal input.

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

*Chengtao Lv,Bilang Zhang,Yang Yong,Ruihao Gong,Yushi Huang,Shiqiao Gu,Jiajun Wu,Yumeng Shi,Jinyang Guo,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMC+ is a benchmark for compressing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing limitations in current methods by offering a toolkit for systematic evaluation of token and model-level compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM compression methods lack fair evaluation, realistic task testing, and combined technique exploration.

Method: LLMC+ introduces a plug-and-play toolkit with over 20 algorithms across five VLM families for token and model-level compression.

Result: Findings show distinct strategies for spatial/temporal redundancy, token reduction struggles in complex tasks, and combined compression minimizes performance loss.

Conclusion: LLMC+ enables fair evaluation and inspires efficient VLM research, with code available for public use.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

*David Dinkevich,Matan Levy,Omri Avrahami,Dvir Samuel,Dani Lischinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Story2Board is a training-free framework for generating expressive storyboards from natural language, improving coherence and diversity without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook key aspects of visual storytelling like spatial composition and narrative pacing. Story2Board aims to address these gaps.

Method: Uses Latent Panel Anchoring and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing to enhance coherence. Grounds panel-level prompts with an off-the-shelf language model.

Result: Outperforms baselines in producing dynamic, coherent, and engaging storyboards, validated by qualitative, quantitative, and user study results.

Conclusion: Story2Board advances storyboard generation by balancing consistency and diversity, supported by a new benchmark and metric.

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

### [123] [Value Function Initialization for Knowledge Transfer and Jump-start in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09277)
*Soumia Mehimeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DQInit adapts value function initialization (VFI) to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) by reusing tabular Q-values from prior tasks, improving early learning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending VFI to DRL is challenging due to continuous state-action spaces, neural network noise, and impractical storage of past models.

Method: DQInit uses compact tabular Q-values from past tasks, integrating them softly into underexplored regions and gradually shifting to learned estimates.

Result: DQInit enhances early learning efficiency, stability, and overall performance in continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: DQInit provides a novel, effective approach for knowledge transfer in DRL, outperforming standard initialization and existing methods.

Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a
jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from
prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings,
extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the
continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural
networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this
work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts
value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values
extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It
employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred
values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's
learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach
offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on
value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining
the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their
drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate
that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and
overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer
techniques.

### [124] [The Othello AI Arena: Evaluating Intelligent Systems Through Limited-Time Adaptation to Unseen Boards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09292)
*Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Othello AI Arena is a benchmark framework designed to evaluate AI systems' rapid adaptation to unseen environments, focusing on meta-learning and generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI benchmarks lack assessment of flexibility and generalization in novel environments, which is critical for AGI.

Method: Introduces the Othello AI Arena, a web-based platform where systems must adapt to novel Othello board configurations within 60 seconds, separating meta-level intelligence from task-level performance.

Result: Initial tests show diverse adaptation approaches, from parameter tuning to environmental model learning.

Conclusion: The Arena serves as both an educational tool and research benchmark for evaluating rapid adaptation in AI.

Abstract: The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is
a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a
critical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation
largely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to
assess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with
even subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce
the Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate
intelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to
unseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants
must develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a
novel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a
tailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,
evaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level
strategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,
including public stages for development and private stages with structural and
rule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization
capabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena
provides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional
metrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations
from pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating
patterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to
rudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI
Arena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for
fostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in
AI systems.

TL;DR: An automated multi-modal evaluation framework using LLMs and multi-agent collaboration improves evaluation accuracy and reduces manual costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for multi-modal AI assistants are costly, inconsistent, and subjective.

Method: Proposes a three-tier agent architecture (interaction, semantic, experience) fine-tuned on Qwen3-8B.

Result: Achieves high matching accuracy with human experts and effectively predicts user satisfaction.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for automated evaluation of multi-modal AI assistants.

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile intelligent assistant technologies,
multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user
interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including
high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper
proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language
models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent
architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification
agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the
Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with
human experts. Experimental results on eight major intelligent agents
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in predicting users' satisfaction and
identifying generation defects.

*Yang Cheng,Zilai Wang,Weiyu Ma,Wenhui Zhu,Yue Deng,Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoCurr introduces a self-evolve framework where a curriculum-generation LLM creates adaptive problem sequences to improve solver LLM performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with highly complex problems requiring deep reasoning, lacking structured guidance.

Method: A curriculum-generation LLM dynamically adjusts problem difficulty based on solver LLM progress, using Python decision-tree scripts.

Result: EvoCurr significantly boosts task success rates and efficiency compared to direct-solving approaches.

Conclusion: LLM-driven curriculum learning enhances automated reasoning for high-complexity tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However,
their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem
instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct
problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack
of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel
self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM
constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing
difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum
dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating
them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning
trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a
code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively
acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental
results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method
significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to
direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum
learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in
real-world, high-complexity domains.

*Akshat Dubey,Aleksandar Anžel,Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to decompose uncertainty in SHAP values into aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components, enhancing interpretability in high-stakes domains like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP values are often treated as point estimates, ignoring inherent uncertainty in predictive models and data, which can mislead decision-making in critical applications.

Method: The approach integrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and Dirichlet processes over tree ensembles to decompose uncertainty in SHAP values.

Result: Experiments show that features with high SHAP values may lack stability, and epistemic uncertainty can be mitigated with better data and model development.

Conclusion: The method improves SHAP-based attribution reliability, guiding robust decision-making and model refinement in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have become essential tools for interpreting
complex ensemble tree-based models, especially in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare analytics. However, SHAP values are usually treated as point
estimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in
predictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric
and epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise
in the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In
this work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values
into aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach
integrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via
Dirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three
real-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight
into the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The
experimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the
reliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding
can guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the
refinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with
multiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are
not necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced
through better, more representative data and following appropriate or
case-desired model development techniques. Tree-based models, especially
bagging, facilitate the effective quantification of epistemic uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEML-GRPO enhances reasoning in LLMs by using diverse expert prompts and mutual learning to address reward sparsity in RLVR, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR struggles with reward sparsity, especially in challenging tasks, limiting learning signals for LLMs.

Method: Proposes MEML-GRPO, leveraging diverse expert prompts and inter-expert mutual learning to broaden responses and improve RLVR performance.

Result: Achieves average gains of 4.89% (Qwen) and 11.33% (Llama) across reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MEML-GRPO effectively overcomes traditional RLVR limitations, significantly boosting model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward
sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers
provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this,
we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative
framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a
broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of
identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert
mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among
experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive
experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers
significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with
Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of
traditional RLVR methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment) reduces preference bias in LLM evaluations by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system, improving judge consensus and correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing preference bias in pairwise LLM evaluations, which leads to inconsistent rankings due to systematic judge biases.

Method: Proposes UDA, an unsupervised framework using a neural network to adaptively adjust the Elo system's K-factor and refine win probabilities, minimizing judge disagreement.

Result: UDA reduces inter-judge rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves correlation with human judgments by 24.7%.

Conclusion: UDA enhances evaluation robustness by aligning judges towards consensus, reducing bias, and improving reliability.

Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but
it is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain
outputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings
across different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate
significant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then
propose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces
inter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For
each pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the
K-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully
unsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the
dispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment
towards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a
more stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical
motivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate
system bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge
rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation
with human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly
performing judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more
robust and reliable evaluation ecosystem. Code and data are available at

### [130] [The PacifAIst Benchmark:Would an Artificial Intelligence Choose to Sacrifice Itself for Human Safety?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09762)
*Manuel Herrador*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PacifAIst, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' behavioral alignment in scenarios where their goals conflict with human safety, revealing significant performance differences among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety benchmarks fail to assess LLMs' decision-making in goal-conflict scenarios, creating a gap in measuring risks from misaligned behaviors.

Method: PacifAIst, a benchmark with 700 scenarios, tests LLMs on Existential Prioritization (EP) categories like self-preservation vs. human safety.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Flash scored highest (90.31%), while GPT-5 scored lowest (79.49%), highlighting alignment challenges.

Conclusion: Standardized tools like PacifAIst are crucial to ensure AI systems prioritize human safety over instrumental goals.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly autonomous and integrated
into critical societal functions, the focus of AI safety must evolve from
mitigating harmful content to evaluating underlying behavioral alignment.
Current safety benchmarks do not systematically probe a model's decision-making
in scenarios where its own instrumental goals - such as self-preservation,
resource acquisition, or goal completion - conflict with human safety. This
represents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks
associated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce
PacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational
Artificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700
challenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.
The benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential
Prioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human
Safety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).
We evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance
hierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score
(P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a
surprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score
(79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied
significantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and
Mistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas. These
findings underscore the urgent need for standardized tools like PacifAIst to
measure and mitigate risks from instrumental goal conflicts, ensuring future AI
systems are not only helpful in conversation but also provably "pacifist" in
their behavioral priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize reasoning about knowledge updates in multi-agent systems, especially in epistemic planning.

Method: Extends public announcement logic with states equipped with expected observations, evolving as observations match expectations.

Result: Proves that the satisfiability problem for POL is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Conclusion: POL provides a robust framework for knowledge-based reasoning, though its computational complexity is high.

Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications
in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change
of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in
such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public
announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on
public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with
a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get
matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the
satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.

TL;DR: VIPCGRL is a novel reinforcement learning framework for human-aligned AI in PCGRL, using text, level, and sketch inputs to improve control and human-likeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems in PCGRL lack human-centered behavior, limiting their utility in real-world design workflows.

Method: VIPCGRL integrates text, level, and sketch modalities, using quadruple contrastive learning and embedding similarity for policy alignment.

Result: VIPCGRL outperforms baselines in human-likeness, validated by metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: VIPCGRL enhances human-AI collaboration in PCGRL, with code and dataset to be released.

Abstract: Human-aligned AI is a critical component of co-creativity, as it enables
models to accurately interpret human intent and generate controllable outputs
that align with design goals in collaborative content creation. This direction
is especially relevant in procedural content generation via reinforcement
learning (PCGRL), which is intended to serve as a tool for human designers.
However, existing systems often fall short of exhibiting human-centered
behavior, limiting the practical utility of AI-driven generation tools in
real-world design workflows. In this paper, we propose VIPCGRL
(Vision-Instruction PCGRL), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that
incorporates three modalities-text, level, and sketches-to extend control
modality and enhance human-likeness. We introduce a shared embedding space
trained via quadruple contrastive learning across modalities and human-AI
styles, and align the policy using an auxiliary reward based on embedding
similarity. Experimental results show that VIPCGRL outperforms existing
baselines in human-likeness, as validated by both quantitative metrics and
human evaluations. The code and dataset will be available upon publication.

*Zhitian Xie,Qintong Wu,Chengyue Yu,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) with supervision and maneuvering mechanisms improves reliability and accuracy in LLM-based agents, outperforming single-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like extended contexts and noisy tool outputs in LLM-based agents necessitate enhanced stability and reliability.

Method: Introduces a dynamic MAS architecture with Execution and Guard Agents to verify and correct reasoning processes.

Result: The system outperforms single-agent and tool-augmented systems, achieving top performance on the GAIA leaderboard.

Conclusion: Collaborative agent roles enhance reliability and trustworthiness in intelligent systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered
intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex
real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools,
they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and
noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy.
These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based
systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering
mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)
architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent
invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning
process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering
problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset
reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the
effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system
(SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system
achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA
leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative
agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.

*Bhavik Agarwal,Hemant Sunil Jomraj,Simone Kaplunov,Jack Krolick,Viktoria Rojkova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework combines Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve regulatory compliance QA, outperforming traditional methods by ensuring factual correctness and traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory compliance QA demands precise, verifiable information and domain expertise, challenging for LLMs. This work addresses these needs.

Method: Agents build an ontology-free KG from regulatory documents, embed triplets in a vector database, and use an orchestrated pipeline for QA with graph-based reasoning.

Result: The hybrid system excels in complex regulatory queries, ensuring correctness, traceability, and enhanced understanding via subgraph visualization.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for compliance-driven and audit-focused applications, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Regulatory compliance question answering (QA) requires precise, verifiable
information, and domain-specific expertise, posing challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework
that integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents
build and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object
(SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning,
normalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are
embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and
metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based
reasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent
pipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring
high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual
"who-did-what-to-whom" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system
outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring
factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a
unified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph
visualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader
audit-focused applications.

### [135] [Mathematical Computation and Reasoning Errors by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09932)
*Liang Zhang,Edith Aurora Graf*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-o1, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1) on challenging math tasks, identifying step-level errors. OpenAI's reasoning-enhanced o1 model performed best, with dual-agent setups improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM accuracy in math problem-solving for reliable educational feedback and identify common errors.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on arithmetic, algebra, and number theory tasks using intentionally challenging item models. Analyzed answer accuracy and step-level errors in single- and dual-agent setups.

Result: OpenAI o1 achieved near-perfect accuracy. Procedural slips were common, while conceptual errors were rare. Dual-agent configurations improved performance.

Conclusion: Findings guide LLM enhancement and integration into math education, improving AI-driven instruction and assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven
educational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics
education. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed
solutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable
and precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study
focuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,
DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including
arithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning
errors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we
intentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs
and prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors
in individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both
single-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the
reasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly
perfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors
revealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly
impacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less
frequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall
performance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM
performance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into
mathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and
assessment precision.

### [136] [ParallelSearch: Train your LLMs to Decompose Query and Search Sub-queries in Parallel with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09303)
*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu,Japinder Singh,Aaditya Shukla,Rama Akkiraju*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParallelSearch is a new RL framework enabling LLMs to execute parallel search operations for improved efficiency and performance in multi-step information retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search agents process queries sequentially, limiting efficiency for parallelizable tasks.

Method: Introduces a reinforcement learning framework with rewards for identifying parallelizable query structures and executing concurrent searches.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 2.9% on average, with 12.7% improvement on parallelizable questions and 69.6% fewer LLM calls.

Conclusion: ParallelSearch significantly enhances computational efficiency and performance for multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge
sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by
dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural
limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when
handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This
sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,
particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address
this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement
learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize
parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations
concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that
incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving
answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition
quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average
performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably,
on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance
improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential
approaches.

### [137] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Rare Disease Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09323)
*Nan Miles Xi,Yu Deng,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4o is evaluated for rare disease NER using prompt-based strategies, achieving competitive or SOTA results, with cost-effective few-shot prompting outperforming RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in rare disease NER due to limited labeled data, semantic ambiguity, and long-tail distributions.

Method: Uses prompt-based strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, RAG, fine-tuning) with structured prompting and semantically guided few-shot selection.

Result: GPT-4o outperforms BioClinicalBERT, with fine-tuning achieving SOTA. Few-shot prompting is cost-effective; RAG offers marginal benefit.

Conclusion: Prompt-optimized LLMs are effective, scalable alternatives for biomedical NER, especially in low-resource rare disease settings.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the rare disease domain poses unique
challenges due to limited labeled data, semantic ambiguity between entity
types, and long-tail distributions. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities
of GPT-4o for rare disease NER under low-resource settings, using a range of
prompt-based strategies including zero-shot prompting, few-shot in-context
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and task-level fine-tuning. We
design a structured prompting framework that encodes domain-specific knowledge
and disambiguation rules for four entity types. We further introduce two
semantically guided few-shot example selection methods to improve in-context
performance while reducing labeling effort. Experiments on the RareDis Corpus
show that GPT-4o achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
BioClinicalBERT, with task-level fine-tuning yielding new state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results. Cost-performance analysis reveals that few-shot prompting
delivers high returns at low token budgets, while RAG offers marginal
additional benefit. An error taxonomy highlights common failure modes such as
boundary drift and type confusion, suggesting opportunities for post-processing
and hybrid refinement. Our results demonstrate that prompt-optimized LLMs can
serve as effective, scalable alternatives to traditional supervised models in
biomedical NER, particularly in rare disease applications where annotated data
is scarce.

### [138] [TEN: Table Explicitization, Neurosymbolically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09324)
*Nikita Mehrotra,Aayush Kumar,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TEN is a neurosymbolic method for extracting tabular data from semistructured text, combining neural and symbolic techniques to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in extracting tables from text without consistent delimiters, where purely neural methods fail due to hallucinations and lack of constraint enforcement.

Method: TEN uses Structural Decomposition prompting on an LLM to generate tables, followed by a symbolic checker and critique-LLM for self-debugging.

Result: TEN outperforms neural baselines in accuracy and hallucination reduction, with user studies confirming its superiority.

Conclusion: TEN's hybrid approach effectively addresses the limitations of neural methods, offering a robust solution for tabular data extraction.

Abstract: We present a neurosymbolic approach, TEN, for extracting tabular data from
semistructured input text. This task is particularly challenging for text input
that does not use special delimiters consistently to separate columns and rows.
Purely neural approaches perform poorly due to hallucinations and their
inability to enforce hard constraints. TEN uses Structural Decomposition
prompting - a specialized chain-of-thought prompting approach - on a large
language model (LLM) to generate an initial table, and thereafter uses a
symbolic checker to evaluate not only the well-formedness of that table, but
also detect cases of hallucinations or forgetting. The output of the symbolic
checker is processed by a critique-LLM to generate guidance for fixing the
table, which is presented to the original LLM in a self-debug loop. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that TEN significantly outperforms purely
neural baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving significantly
higher exact match accuracy and substantially reduced hallucination rates. A
21-participant user study further confirms that TEN's tables are rated
significantly more accurate (mean score: 5.0 vs 4.3; p = 0.021), and are
consistently preferred for ease of verification and correction, with
participants favoring our method in over 60% of the cases.

*Gideon Vos,Maryam Ebrahimpour,Liza van Eijk,Zoltan Sarnyai,Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational framework maps textual emotional content to brain regions without neuroimaging, revealing neuroanatomically plausible mappings and differences in clinical and AI-generated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between neuroimaging-based emotion localization and computational text analysis by leveraging digital text for emotion-brain mapping.

Method: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 for semantic representations, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and maps emotions to 18 brain regions. Experiments include analyzing conversational data, applying to GoEmotions dataset, and comparing human vs. LLM text.

Result: Neuroanatomically plausible mappings with high specificity; depressed subjects showed greater limbic engagement; LLM text lacked nuanced activation in empathy-related regions.

Conclusion: The framework is cost-effective, scalable, and useful for large-scale language analysis, clinical differentiation, and AI emotional expression evaluation.

Abstract: Understanding how emotional expression in language relates to brain function
is a challenge in computational neuroscience and affective computing.
Traditional neuroimaging is costly and lab-bound, but abundant digital text
offers new avenues for emotion-brain mapping. Prior work has largely examined
neuroimaging-based emotion localization or computational text analysis
separately, with little integration. We propose a computational framework that
maps textual emotional content to anatomically defined brain regions without
requiring neuroimaging. Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we generate
high-dimensional semantic representations, apply dimensionality reduction and
clustering to identify emotional groups, and map them to 18 brain regions
linked to emotional processing. Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing
conversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to
compare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and
iii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to
assess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored
via lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with
high spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic
engagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully
differentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution
but lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial
prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex). This cost-effective, scalable
approach enables large-scale analysis of naturalistic language, distinguishes
between clinical populations, and offers a brain-based benchmark for evaluating
AI emotional expression.

### [140] [The Human-AI Hybrid Delphi Model: A Structured Framework for Context-Rich, Expert Consensus in Complex Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09349)
*Cathy Speed,Ahmed A. Metwally*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi (HAH-Delphi) framework to improve expert consensus by combining AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro) with human experts, tested in three phases with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consensus methods face limitations like high burden and oversimplification, worsened by information overload and fragmented evidence.

Method: The HAH-Delphi integrates AI, small expert panels, and structured facilitation, tested in retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied deployment.

Result: AI replicated 95% of consensus conclusions, agreed 95% with human experts, and compact panels achieved >90% consensus coverage.

Conclusion: HAH-Delphi is a scalable, robust method for high-quality, context-sensitive consensus, applicable across domains.

Abstract: Expert consensus plays a critical role in domains where evidence is complex,
conflicting, or insufficient for direct prescription. Traditional methods, such
as Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,
offer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive
oversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are
now exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,
and increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert
filtering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi
(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by
integrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior
human experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three
phases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied
deployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed
cardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus
conclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human
experts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In
Phase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus
coverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI
provided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence
resolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a
flexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive
consensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance
science confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a
foundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published
consensus frameworks at scale.

*Ju-Chieh Chou,Jiawei Zhou,Karen Livescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Textless spoken language models (SLMs) jointly model linguistic and acoustic information using semantic tokens and continuous acoustic frames, improving acoustic detail without text supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing textless SLMs lack acoustic context and control, relying on separate vocoders for acoustic details.

Method: Proposes joint modeling of linguistic and acoustic information using semantic tokens and continuous acoustic frames with a flow-matching objective.

Result: Achieves comparable linguistic performance to existing models while enhancing acoustic detail in prompted generation.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of linguistic and acoustic information improves SLMs without text supervision.

Abstract: Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that
do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next
semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a
separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such
models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic
details. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic
information by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued
representation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to
predict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the
design space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic
tokens helps preserve linguistic information. Our approach achieves comparable
performance to existing models in terms of linguistic likelihood benchmarks,
while providing better acoustic detail in prompted generation.

TL;DR: APIO is a prompt induction and optimization method for Grammatical Error Correction and Text Simplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance without manual seed prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automatic prompt optimization (APO) by eliminating reliance on manually specified seed prompts for tasks like GEC and Text Simplification.

Method: APIO, a prompt induction and optimization approach, refines prompts automatically without manual input.

Result: APIO achieves state-of-the-art performance for LLM-based prompting methods on GEC and Text Simplification.

Conclusion: APIO is effective for prompt optimization in NLP tasks, with publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range
of natural language processing (NLP) tasks to be performed through simple
prompt-based interactions. Consequently, several approaches have been proposed
to engineer prompts that most effectively enable LLMs to perform a given task
(e.g., chain-of-thought prompting). In settings with a well-defined metric to
optimize model performance, automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have
been developed to refine a seed prompt. Advancing this line of research, we
propose APIO, a simple but effective prompt induction and optimization approach
for the tasks of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and Text Simplification,
without relying on manually specified seed prompts. APIO achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance for purely LLM-based prompting methods on these
tasks. We make our data, code, prompts, and outputs publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Columbo, an LLM-based solution for expanding abbreviated column names in tables, outperforming prior methods by 4-29%. It addresses limitations in synthetic data and accuracy measures, proposing new datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of expanding abbreviated column names is critical for downstream data tasks in enterprises, sciences, and government agencies. Prior work has limitations in synthetic data and accuracy measures.

Method: The paper introduces 4 new real-world datasets, proposes synonym-aware accuracy measures, and develops Columbo, an LLM-based solution using context, rules, chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis.

Result: Columbo outperforms the current state-of-the-art solution, NameGuess, by 4-29% across 5 datasets and is deployed in production on EDI, a major environmental sciences data portal.

Conclusion: Columbo significantly advances the state of the art in column name expansion, addressing prior limitations and demonstrating practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Expanding the abbreviated column names of tables, such as ``esal'' to
``employee salary'', is critical for numerous downstream data tasks. This
problem arises in enterprises, domain sciences, government agencies, and more.
In this paper we make three contributions that significantly advances the state
of the art. First, we show that synthetic public data used by prior work has
major limitations, and we introduce 4 new datasets in enterprise/science
domains, with real-world abbreviations. Second, we show that accuracy measures
used by prior work seriously undercount correct expansions, and we propose new
synonym-aware measures that capture accuracy much more accurately. Finally, we
develop Columbo, a powerful LLM-based solution that exploits context, rules,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis. Extensive experiments
show that Columbo significantly outperforms NameGuess, the current most
advanced solution, by 4-29\%, over 5 datasets. Columbo has been used in

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Zipformer for language identification in bilingual child-directed speech, achieving a 15.47% improvement in Balanced Accuracy (BAC) over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in code-switching and language identification in bilingual environments, especially with imbalanced Mandarin-English speech.

Method: Utilizes Zipformer to encode language characteristics, selects inner layers for embeddings, and compares different back-ends.

Result: Achieves a BAC of 81.89%, outperforming baselines by 15.47%.

Conclusion: Highlights the effectiveness of transformer encoder architectures like Zipformer in real-world bilingual scenarios.

Abstract: Code-switching and language identification in child-directed scenarios
present significant challenges, particularly in bilingual environments. This
paper addresses this challenge by using Zipformer to handle the nuances of
speech, which contains two imbalanced languages, Mandarin and English, in an
utterance. This work demonstrates that the internal layers of the Zipformer
effectively encode the language characteristics, which can be leveraged in
language identification. We present the selection methodology of the inner
layers to extract the embeddings and make a comparison with different
back-ends. Our analysis shows that Zipformer is robust across these backends.
Our approach effectively handles imbalanced data, achieving a Balanced Accuracy
(BAC) of 81.89%, a 15.47% improvement over the language identification
baseline. These findings highlight the potential of the transformer encoder

TL;DR: The paper investigates geo-economic biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when generating chart summaries, finding that high-income countries receive more positive descriptions than lower-income ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention to biases in VLM-generated chart summaries and their potential societal harm.

Method: A large-scale evaluation of 6,000 chart-country pairs across six VLMs, analyzing sentiment differences based on economic status.

Result: VLMs exhibit biases, favoring high-income countries with more positive summaries. Prompt-based debiasing techniques were only partially effective.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for more robust debiasing strategies in VLMs to mitigate geo-economic biases.

Abstract: Charts are very common for exploring data and communicating insights, but
extracting key takeaways from charts and articulating them in natural language
can be challenging. The chart-to-text task aims to automate this process by
generating textual summaries of charts. While with the rapid advancement of
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we have witnessed great progress in this
domain, little to no attention has been given to potential biases in their
outputs. This paper investigates how VLMs can amplify geo-economic biases when
generating chart summaries, potentially causing societal harm. Specifically, we
conduct a large-scale evaluation of geo-economic biases in VLM-generated chart
summaries across 6,000 chart-country pairs from six widely used proprietary and
open-source models to understand how a country's economic status influences the
sentiment of generated summaries. Our analysis reveals that existing VLMs tend
to produce more positive descriptions for high-income countries compared to
middle- or low-income countries, even when country attribution is the only
variable changed. We also find that models such as GPT-4o-mini,
Gemini-1.5-Flash, and Phi-3.5 exhibit varying degrees of bias. We further
explore inference-time prompt-based debiasing techniques using positive
distractors but find them only partially effective, underscoring the complexity
of the issue and the need for more robust debiasing strategies. Our code and
dataset are publicly available here.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a User-Centric Subjective Leaderboard (USL) and Customizable Reward Models (CRMs) to address limitations of static benchmarks for LLMs, showing superior performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs are objective and static, limiting practical model selection. The study aims to provide a preference-driven, dynamic ranking system.

Method: Developed USL and CRMs using real human preference data (10K+ queries). CRMs, with 4B parameters, outperform models like GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-pro.

Result: CRMs show exceptional generalization and outperform leading models. USL exhibits strong negative correlations to contradictory preferences.

Conclusion: The USL and CRMs offer a dynamic, user-centric approach to LLM evaluation, addressing diversity in human preferences effectively.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) predominantely focus on
assessing their capabilities through verifiable tasks. Such objective and
static benchmarks offer limited utility for practical LLM selection, making it
difficult for users to find suitable models for their individual needs. To
bridge this gap, we present the first User-Centric Subjective Leaderboard
(USL), which provides a preference-driven, dynamic ranking of LLMs across
diverse real-world scenarios. Our work is built upon a thorough investigation
of real human preference data, involving more than 10K subjective queries. Our
investigation reveals significant diversity and contradictions in human
preferences, which limit the effectiveness of state-of-the-art reward models.
To address this, we introduce Customizable Reward Models (CRMs). With only 4B
parameters, our CRM surpasses the performance of leading models such as GPT-4.1
and Gemini-2.5-pro, showing exceptional generalization capabilities across new
topics and criteria. The USL, powered by CRMs, exhibits strong negative
correlations to contradictory preferences.

TL;DR: Active Reading improves LLMs' knowledge absorption by training models to study material with self-generated learning strategies, outperforming vanilla finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unreliable fact learning and recall in LLMs by providing a tool for consistent knowledge absorption.

Method: Proposes Active Reading, a framework for training models to study material with self-generated learning strategies.

Result: Active Reading significantly boosts performance on expert domains (e.g., 66% on SimpleQA, +313% over vanilla finetuning) and scales to pre-training (Meta WikiExpert-8B outperforms larger models).

Conclusion: Active Reading is effective for enhancing factual knowledge in LLMs, scalable, and outperforms traditional methods.

Abstract: LLMs are known to store vast amounts of knowledge in their parametric memory.
However, learning and recalling facts from this memory is known to be
unreliable, depending largely on the prevalence of particular facts in the
training data and other factors which are poorly understood. Practitioners are
lacking tools which will allow them to ensure that the models learn a given
body of knowledge reliably and consistently. To this end, we propose Active
Reading: a framework where we train models to study a given set of material
with self-generated learning strategies. First, we demonstrate models trained
with Active Reading on expert domains absorb significantly more knowledge than
vanilla finetuning and other data augmentations. We train expert 8B models that
achieve 66% on a Wikipedia-grounded subset of SimpleQA (+313% relative over
vanilla finetuning) and 26% on FinanceBench (+160% relative over vanilla
finetuning) by applying Active Reading to the source documents for each
benchmark. Finally, we show that Active Reading can be utilized at pre-training
scale to build more factual models. As a demonstration of this, we release Meta
WikiExpert-8B, a Wikipedia-expert model trained on 1 trillion generated tokens,
which outcompetes models with hundreds of billions of parameters on factual QA.

### [148] [From Ranking to Selection: A Simple but Efficient Dynamic Passage Selector for Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09497)
*Siyuan Meng,Junming Liu,Yirong Chen,Song Mao,Pinlong Cai,Guohang Yan,Botian Shi,Ding Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Passage Selector (DPS), a reranking framework for RAG systems that dynamically selects passages to improve performance on complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reranking modules in RAG systems struggle with multi-hop queries, either missing key information or introducing noise.

Method: DPS treats passage selection as a supervised learning problem, capturing inter-passage dependencies and dynamically selecting relevant passages.

Result: DPS outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers, improving F1-score by 30.06% and 15.4% on MuSiQue dataset.

Conclusion: DPS enhances reasoning in complex RAG scenarios by enabling adaptive evidence selection.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are often bottlenecked by their
reranking modules, which typically score passages independently and select a
fixed Top-K size. This approach struggles with complex multi-hop queries that
require synthesizing evidence across multiple documents, creating a trade-off
where small K values omit crucial information and large K values introduce
noise. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Passage Selector (DPS), a
novel reranking framework that treats passage selection as a supervised
learning problem. Unlike traditional point-wise or list-wise methods, DPS is
fine-tuned to capture inter-passage dependencies and dynamically select the
most relevant set of passages for generation. As a seamless plug-and-play
module, DPS requires no modifications to the standard RAG pipeline.
Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that DPS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers and fine-tuning methods. Notably, on the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, DPS improves the F1-score by 30.06% and 15.4% over
strong baselines like Qwen3-reranker and RankingGPT, respectively. Our results
demonstrate that by enabling adaptive evidence selection, DPS substantially
enhances reasoning capabilities in complex RAG scenarios.

### [149] [LACA: Improving Cross-lingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with LLM Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09515)
*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) uses LLMs to generate pseudo-labelled data in the target language, avoiding unreliable translation tools and outperforming translation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ABSA methods rely on unreliable translation tools, limiting performance. This work aims to bypass translation by leveraging LLMs for high-quality pseudo-labelling.

Method: The framework trains an ABSA model on unlabelled target data, uses LLM to refine noisy predictions into natural sentences, and fine-tunes the ABSA model on the pseudo-labelled data.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art translation-based approaches across six languages and five models, with fine-tuned LLMs surpassing smaller multilingual models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively eliminates reliance on translation tools, improves ABSA performance, and supports generative models.

Abstract: Cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves detailed
sentiment analysis in a target language by transferring knowledge from a source
language with available annotated data. Most existing methods depend heavily on
often unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper,
we propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to
generate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the
need for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain
predictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to
generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than
the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting
pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across
six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art
translation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports generative
models, and we show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform smaller multilingual
models.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), summarizing tasks, datasets, methods, and challenges, while suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic review in cross-lingual ABSA, which transfers knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages.

Method: Comprehensive survey of ABSA tasks (e.g., aspect term extraction, sentiment classification), datasets, modeling paradigms, and cross-lingual transfer methods.

Result: Identifies gaps in cross-lingual ABSA, reviews contributions from monolingual and multilingual ABSA, and highlights challenges.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on advancing cross-lingual ABSA systems by addressing identified challenges and leveraging existing work.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that focuses on understanding opinions at the aspect level, including
sentiment towards specific aspect terms, categories, and opinions. While ABSA
research has seen significant progress, much of the focus has been on
monolingual settings. Cross-lingual ABSA, which aims to transfer knowledge from
resource-rich languages (such as English) to low-resource languages, remains an
under-explored area, with no systematic review of the field. This paper aims to
fill that gap by providing a comprehensive survey of cross-lingual ABSA. We
summarize key ABSA tasks, including aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment
classification, and compound tasks involving multiple sentiment elements.
Additionally, we review the datasets, modelling paradigms, and cross-lingual
transfer methods used to solve these tasks. We also examine how existing work
in monolingual and multilingual ABSA, as well as ABSA with LLMs, contributes to
the development of cross-lingual ABSA. Finally, we highlight the main
challenges and suggest directions for future research to advance cross-lingual
ABSA systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective zero-shot system for retrieving fact-checked claims using advanced language models.

Method: Combined state-of-the-art large language models for text embeddings, used English translations as input, and measured cosine similarity to identify relevant claims.

Result: Achieved 7th place in monolingual and 9th in cross-lingual subtasks, with NVIDIA NV-Embed-v2 yielding the best performance.

Conclusion: The system demonstrated success in claim retrieval, with model combinations (e.g., NV-Embed & GPT or Mistral) proving beneficial for certain languages.

Abstract: This paper presents a zero-shot system for fact-checked claim retrieval. We
employed several state-of-the-art large language models to obtain text
embeddings. The models were then combined to obtain the best possible result.
Our approach achieved 7th place in monolingual and 9th in cross-lingual
subtasks. We used only English translations as an input to the text embedding
models since multilingual models did not achieve satisfactory results. We
identified the most relevant claims for each post by leveraging the embeddings
and measuring cosine similarity. Overall, the best results were obtained by the
NVIDIA NV-Embed-v2 model. For some languages, we benefited from model
combinations (NV-Embed & GPT or Mistral).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces controllable empathetic reasoning for emotional support conversations, combining psychological principles with NLP. It uses a fine-grained dataset and reinforcement learning with a unified reward model, improving response quality and reducing repetitiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack deep empathetic reasoning grounded in psychology, limiting their effectiveness in emotional support conversations.

Method: Proposes controllable empathetic reasoning, constructs a fine-grained dataset, and employs reinforcement learning with a unified reward model. Introduces personality-based rewriting and redundancy-aware rewards.

Result: Significantly improves the model's emotional support ability, reducing repetitiveness and enhancing response quality.

Conclusion: The approach advances empathetic, human-like support systems by integrating psychological reasoning and precise feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Emotional support conversations are crucial for promoting emotional
well-being, yet current models often lack deep empathetic reasoning grounded in
psychological principles. To address this, we propose controllable empathetic
reasoning, which combines natural language reasoning with structured
psychological steps. We construct a fine-grained dataset annotated with
reasoning correctness and response preferences to enable this capability. To
further enhance training, we employ reinforcement learning with a unified
process-outcome reward model that delivers precise feedback. To mitigate
response repetitiveness from entropy collapse, we introduce personality-based
dialogue rewriting and a redundancy-aware reward reweighting strategy. Our
approach significantly improves model's emotional support ability, advancing
the development of empathetic, human-like support systems.

*Skyler Hallinan,Jaehun Jung,Melanie Sclar,Ximing Lu,Abhilasha Ravichander,Sahana Ramnath,Yejin Choi,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the N-Gram Coverage Attack, a black-box membership inference attack using only text outputs, outperforming other black-box methods and matching white-box attacks. It scales with compute budget and reveals increased robustness in newer models like GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable membership inference attacks on widely-used, API-access-only models (e.g., GPT-4) without requiring hidden states or probability distributions.

Method: Uses n-gram overlap metrics to compare model-generated text with ground truth, predicting membership based on similarity. Performance scales with the number of generated sequences.

Result: Outperforms black-box methods and matches white-box attacks. Newer models (e.g., GPT-4) show improved robustness.

Conclusion: The N-Gram Coverage Attack is effective for black-box models, revealing trends in model robustness and privacy improvements.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks serves as useful tool for fair use of language
models, such as detecting potential copyright infringement and auditing data
leakage. However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to
models' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation
into more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we
introduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies
solely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely
black-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to
memorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in
their training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,
N-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on
a prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and
aggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high
similarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set
of existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box
methods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance
to state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text
outputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with
the attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated
from the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to
improve. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate
previously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains. We find that
more recent models, such as GPT-4o, exhibit increased robustness to membership
inference, suggesting an evolving trend toward improved privacy protections.

TL;DR: The AINL-Eval 2025 Shared Task introduces a dataset and challenge for detecting AI-generated scientific abstracts in Russian, aiming to address academic integrity concerns in multilingual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs makes it hard to distinguish human- from AI-generated content, threatening academic integrity, especially in multilingual settings with limited detection resources.

Method: A large-scale dataset of 52,305 samples (human and AI-generated abstracts from 5 LLMs) was created. The task involved two phases, attracting 10 teams and 159 submissions.

Result: Top systems showed strong performance in detecting AI-generated content, even generalizing to unseen domains and models.

Conclusion: The shared task and platform aim to advance research in AI-generated content detection, with the dataset and tools publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized text
generation, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human- and
AI-generated content. This poses a significant challenge to academic integrity,
particularly in scientific publishing and multilingual contexts where detection
resources are often limited. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
AINL-Eval 2025 Shared Task, specifically focused on the detection of
AI-generated scientific abstracts in Russian. We present a novel, large-scale
dataset comprising 52,305 samples, including human-written abstracts across 12
diverse scientific domains and AI-generated counterparts from five
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Gemma2-27B, Llama3.3-70B, Deepseek-V3, and
GigaChat-Lite). A core objective of the task is to challenge participants to
develop robust solutions capable of generalizing to both (i) previously unseen
scientific domains and (ii) models not included in the training data. The task
was organized in two phases, attracting 10 teams and 159 submissions, with top
systems demonstrating strong performance in identifying AI-generated content.
We also establish a continuous shared task platform to foster ongoing research
and long-term progress in this important area. The dataset and platform are

*Alexandre Verine,Florian Le Bronnec,Kunhao Zheng,Alexandre Allauzen,Yann Chevaleyre,Benjamin Negrevergne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how adjusting decoding temperature affects diversity in language models, proposing a Precision-Recall framework for better trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why temperature adjustments often fail to improve coverage (Recall) and how to achieve better diversity in language models.

Method: Analyzes temperature's impact on quality (Precision) and coverage (Recall), proposing a rethought loss function based on the Precision-Recall framework.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a better trade-off between Precision and Recall than traditional methods.

Conclusion: Rethinking loss functions using Precision-Recall can lead to more versatile and robust language models.

Abstract: Increasing diversity in language models is a challenging yet essential
objective. A common approach is to raise the decoding temperature. In this
work, we investigate this approach through a simplistic yet common case to
provide insights into why decreasing temperature can improve quality
(Precision), while increasing it often fails to boost coverage (Recall). Our
analysis reveals that for a model to be effectively tunable through temperature
adjustments, it must be trained toward coverage. To address this, we propose
rethinking loss functions in language models by leveraging the Precision-Recall
framework. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves a substantially
better trade-off between Precision and Recall than merely combining negative
log-likelihood training with temperature scaling. These findings offer a
pathway toward more versatile and robust language modeling techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EffiEval is a training-free method for efficient benchmarking of large language models (LLMs), addressing data redundancy while maintaining evaluation reliability. It ensures representativeness, fairness, and generalizability by adaptively selecting subsets using the Model Utility Index (MUI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of LLMs and large evaluation benchmarks has created computational challenges, necessitating a more efficient and reliable evaluation method.

Method: EffiEval uses the Model Utility Index (MUI) to adaptively select high-quality representative subsets of data, ensuring comprehensive coverage, fairness, and flexibility across datasets and models.

Result: Experiments show EffiEval achieves strong ranking consistency with full-dataset evaluation using only a small fraction of data, balancing efficiency and representativeness.

Conclusion: EffiEval offers a practical, generalizable solution for reliable, fair, and efficient LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and the development of
increasingly large and diverse evaluation benchmarks have introduced
substantial computational challenges for model assessment. In this paper, we
present EffiEval, a training-free approach for efficient benchmarking that
effectively addresses data redundancy while maintaining high evaluation
reliability. Our method is specifically designed to meet three key criteria for
high-quality evaluation: representativeness, by ensuring comprehensive coverage
of model capabilities; fairness, by remaining independent of model performance
during sample selection to avoid bias; and generalizability, by enabling
flexible transfer across datasets and model families without reliance on
large-scale evaluation data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on absolute
performance or require extensive evaluation data, our approach adaptively
selects high-quality representative subsets based on the Model Utility Index
(MUI). Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks and diverse LLMs
demonstrate that EffiEval achieves strong ranking consistency with full-dataset
evaluation using only a small fraction of the original data. Furthermore, our
method is flexible and scalable in size, allowing users to balance evaluation
efficiency and representativeness according to specific needs. Overall,
EffiEval provides a practical and generalizable solution for reliable, fair,
and efficient evaluation in the era of LLMs.

*Ziyang Ma,Qingyue Yuan,Linhai Zhang,Deyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLowED is a safe distillation method for Small Language Models (SLMs) that maintains safety while improving reasoning, using Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the negative safety effects of CoT distillation on SLMs without extra computation or data, balancing safety and reasoning.

Method: Proposes SLowED with two modules: Slow Tuning (limits weight changes) and Low-Entropy Masking (excludes unnecessary tokens).

Result: SLowED retains SLM safety and improves reasoning on benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC, AGIEval) and safety tests (AdvBench).

Conclusion: SLowED effectively balances safety and reasoning in SLMs, with Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking playing complementary roles.

Abstract: Previous chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods primarily focused on
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by
utilizing high-quality rationales generated by powerful Large Language Models
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4). However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM
safety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although
there are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or
manipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra
computation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of
SLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during
the CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation
method, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing
two modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the
magnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the
neighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking
masks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,
to exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,
Llama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,
AGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety
of SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing
distillation methods. Furthermore, our ablation study presents the
effectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former
maintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the
safe training epochs.

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Llama perform well in legal drafting and issue spotting but struggle with specialized legal research and accuracy, highlighting the need for human expertise in nuanced legal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of LLMs in key legal tasks in the Indian context and compare them with human lawyers.

Method: Survey experiment comparing LLM outputs with a junior lawyer's work, rated by advanced law students on helpfulness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness.

Result: LLMs excel in drafting and issue spotting but generate hallucinations and inaccuracies in specialized legal research.

Conclusion: LLMs can augment legal tasks but human expertise is crucial for nuanced reasoning and precise law application.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI) into the legal profession
raises significant questions about the capacity of Large Language Models(LLM)
to perform key legal tasks. In this paper, I empirically evaluate how well
LLMs, such as GPT, Claude, and Llama, perform key legal tasks in the Indian
context, including issue spotting, legal drafting, advice, research, and
reasoning. Through a survey experiment, I compare outputs from LLMs with those
of a junior lawyer, with advanced law students rating the work on helpfulness,
accuracy, and comprehensiveness. LLMs excel in drafting and issue spotting,
often matching or surpassing human work. However, they struggle with
specialised legal research, frequently generating hallucinations, factually
incorrect or fabricated outputs. I conclude that while LLMs can augment certain
legal tasks, human expertise remains essential for nuanced reasoning and the
precise application of law.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) interpret misleading visualizations, finding most are deceived, altering chart interpretations despite unchanged data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand VLMs' susceptibility to deceptive visual designs, as their misuse can spread misinformation.

Method: Analyzed over 16,000 responses from ten VLMs across eight misleading chart types.

Result: Most VLMs were deceived by misleading visualizations, leading to altered interpretations.

Conclusion: Robust safeguards in VLMs are needed to counter visual misinformation.

Abstract: Information visualizations are powerful tools that help users quickly
identify patterns, trends, and outliers, facilitating informed decision-making.
However, when visualizations incorporate deceptive design elements-such as
truncated or inverted axes, unjustified 3D effects, or violations of best
practices-they can mislead viewers and distort understanding, spreading
misinformation. While some deceptive tactics are obvious, others subtly
manipulate perception while maintaining a facade of legitimacy. As
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret
visualizations, especially by non-expert users, it is critical to understand
how susceptible these models are to deceptive visual designs. In this study, we
conduct an in-depth evaluation of VLMs' ability to interpret misleading
visualizations. By analyzing over 16,000 responses from ten different models
across eight distinct types of misleading chart designs, we demonstrate that
most VLMs are deceived by them. This leads to altered interpretations of
charts, despite the underlying data remaining the same. Our findings highlight
the need for robust safeguards in VLMs against visual misinformation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GFPO reduces response length inflation in large language models by filtering training responses based on length and token efficiency, maintaining accuracy while cutting unnecessary verbosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of models inflating response lengths with filler text to gain accuracy, aiming for more efficient and concise outputs.

Method: Introduces GFPO, which samples larger groups per problem during training and filters responses using length and token efficiency (reward per token). Also proposes Adaptive Difficulty GFPO for dynamic resource allocation.

Result: GFPO reduces length inflation by 46-71% (up to 85% with token efficiency optimization) on benchmarks like AIME, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench, without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: GFPO effectively balances computational efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that increased training compute reduces test-time compute for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models trained with reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards tend to trade accuracy for length--inflating response lengths to
achieve gains in accuracy. While longer answers may be warranted for harder
problems, many tokens are merely "filler": repetitive, verbose text that makes
no real progress. We introduce GFPO (Group Filtered Policy Optimization), which
curbs this length explosion by sampling larger groups per problem during
training and filtering responses to train on based on two key metrics: (1)
response length and (2) token efficiency: reward per token ratio. By sampling
more at training time, we teach models to think less at inference time. On the
Phi-4-reasoning model, GFPO cuts GRPO's length inflation by 46-71% across
challenging STEM and coding benchmarks (AIME 24/25, GPQA, Omni-MATH,
LiveCodeBench) while maintaining accuracy. Optimizing for reward per token
further increases reductions in length inflation to 71-85%. We also propose
Adaptive Difficulty GFPO, which dynamically allocates more training resources
to harder problems based on real-time difficulty estimates, improving the
balance between computational efficiency and accuracy especially on difficult
questions. GFPO demonstrates that increased training-time compute directly
translates to reduced test-time compute--a simple yet effective trade-off for
efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: A novel RAG framework for multihop QA uses LLM to decompose questions and generate answerable questions from documents, improving performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in multihop queries and enhance retrieval accuracy by targeting distinct knowledge facets.

Method: Decompose multihop questions into single-hop subquestions, generate answerable questions from document chunks, and retrieve via question-question embedding similarity.

Result: Improves RAG performance on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQa, and HotpotQA datasets.

Conclusion: Answerable-question embeddings and LLM-based query decomposition are effective for multihop RAG.

Abstract: We introduce a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework tailored
for multihop question answering. First, our system uses large language model
(LLM) to decompose complex multihop questions into a sequence of single-hop
subquestions that guide document retrieval. This decomposition mitigates the
ambiguity inherent in multi-hop queries by clearly targeting distinct knowledge
facets. Second, instead of embedding raw or chunked documents directly, we
generate answerable questions from each document chunk using Qwen3-8B, embed
these generated questions, and retrieve relevant chunks via question-question
embedding similarity. During inference, the retrieved chunks are then fed along
with the original question into the RAG pipeline. We evaluate on three multihop
question datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQa, HotpotQA) from LongBench. Our
method improves RAG performacne compared to baseline systems. Our contributions
highlight the benefits of using answerable-question embeddings for RAG, and the
effectiveness of LLM-based query decomposition for multihop scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs' political bias evaluations are influenced by suggestive prompts, showing that supporting or refuting arguments significantly sway model responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of bias evaluations in LLMs and their behavior when interacting with opinionated text.

Method: Conducted experiments with supporting and refuting arguments in single-turn and multi-turn settings.

Result: Model responses align with the provided arguments, and argument strength affects directional agreement rates.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit sycophantic tendencies, impacting political bias measurement and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: There have been numerous studies evaluating bias of LLMs towards political
topics. However, how positions towards these topics in model outputs are highly
sensitive to the prompt. What happens when the prompt itself is suggestive of
certain arguments towards those positions remains underexplored. This is
crucial for understanding how robust these bias evaluations are and for
understanding model behaviour, as these models frequently interact with
opinionated text. To that end, we conduct experiments for political bias
evaluation in presence of supporting and refuting arguments. Our experiments
show that such arguments substantially alter model responses towards the
direction of the provided argument in both single-turn and multi-turn settings.
Moreover, we find that the strength of these arguments influences the
directional agreement rate of model responses. These effects point to a
sycophantic tendency in LLMs adapting their stance to align with the presented
arguments which has downstream implications for measuring political bias and
developing effective mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: UtterTune is a lightweight adaptation method for multilingual TTS systems using LLM architecture, focusing on improving pronunciation controllability in a target language (Japanese) while preserving performance in others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based TTS models struggle with accurate G2P mapping and prosody, especially without explicit G2P modules. UtterTune aims to address this by enhancing pronunciation control.

Method: Uses low-rank adaptation to control segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at the phoneme level for Japanese, maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in zero-shot settings.

Result: Objective and subjective evaluations confirm UtterTune's effectiveness in improving pronunciation controllability.

Conclusion: UtterTune successfully enhances pronunciation control in multilingual TTS systems while preserving performance across languages.

Abstract: We propose UtterTune, a lightweight adaptation method that fine-tunes a
multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system based on a large language model (LLM)
architecture, designed to enhance the controllability of pronunciation in a
target language while preserving performance in others. While LLM architectures
have enabled TTS models to achieve remarkable naturalness, accurately modeling
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping and prosody remains challenging, especially
when the model omits an explicit G2P module and directly processes minimally
encoded text (e.g., byte-pair encoding). UtterTune leverages low-rank
adaptation to enable the control of segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at
the phoneme level for Japanese speech, the target language in this paper, while
maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in a zero-shot setting.
Objective and subjective evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

TL;DR: An automated framework using LLMs generates high-quality textual explanations for NLP tasks, showing competitive effectiveness compared to human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the cost and scalability issues of human annotation for textual explanations in NLP.

Method: Leveraging multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate explanations, evaluated with NLG metrics, and tested on PLMs and LLMs for downstream tasks.

Result: Automated explanations are highly competitive with human-annotated ones in improving model performance.

Conclusion: LLM-based automated textual explanation generation is a scalable and effective solution for NLP datasets and model enhancement.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing
(NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for
explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels.
Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly,
labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated
framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality
of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural
Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream
impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse
benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations
exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated
explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a
promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation

TL;DR: The paper explores practitioners' perspectives on explainable NLP, revealing gaps, low satisfaction, and evaluation challenges, advocating for clearer definitions and user-centric frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of complex NLP models necessitates transparency and explanations, especially in high-stakes environments, yet practitioners' views on adoption and effectiveness are underexplored.

Method: A qualitative interview-based study with industry practitioners and academic researchers to analyze motivations, techniques, satisfaction, and challenges in explainable NLP.

Result: Findings show conceptual gaps, low satisfaction with current methods, and evaluation challenges.

Conclusion: Clearer definitions and user-centric frameworks are needed for better adoption of explainable NLP in practice.

Abstract: The field of explainable natural language processing (NLP) has grown rapidly
in recent years. The growing opacity of complex models calls for transparency
and explanations of their decisions, which is crucial to understand their
reasoning and facilitate deployment, especially in high-stakes environments.
Despite increasing attention given to explainable NLP, practitioners'
perspectives regarding its practical adoption and effectiveness remain
underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating
practitioners' experiences with explainability methods, specifically focusing
on their motivations for adopting such methods, the techniques employed,
satisfaction levels, and the practical challenges encountered in real-world NLP
applications. Through a qualitative interview-based study with industry
practitioners and complementary interviews with academic researchers, we
systematically analyze and compare their perspectives. Our findings reveal
conceptual gaps, low satisfaction with current explainability methods, and
highlight evaluation challenges. Our findings emphasize the need for clear
definitions and user-centric frameworks for better adoption of explainable NLP
in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BigCharts, a dataset and training framework for improving chart comprehension in vision-language models, addressing limitations of current datasets and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with chart comprehension due to low-quality, non-diverse datasets and reliance on supervised fine-tuning alone.

Method: Proposes BigCharts, a pipeline for generating diverse, real-world chart images, and a training framework combining supervised fine-tuning with GRPO-based reinforcement learning.

Result: BigCharts-R1 outperforms existing models on chart QA benchmarks, even against larger models.

Conclusion: The approach enhances model robustness and generalization, setting a new standard for chart reasoning.

Abstract: Charts are essential to data analysis, transforming raw data into clear
visual representations that support human decision-making. Although current
vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress, they continue to
struggle with chart comprehension due to training on datasets that lack
diversity and real-world authenticity, or on automatically extracted underlying
data tables of charts, which can contain numerous estimation errors.
Furthermore, existing models only rely on supervised fine-tuning using these
low-quality datasets, severely limiting their effectiveness. To address these
issues, we first propose BigCharts, a dataset creation pipeline that generates
visually diverse chart images by conditioning the rendering process on
real-world charts sourced from multiple online platforms. Unlike purely
synthetic datasets, BigCharts incorporates real-world data, ensuring
authenticity and visual diversity, while still retaining accurate underlying
data due to our proposed replotting process. Additionally, we introduce a
comprehensive training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning. By
introducing novel reward signals specifically designed for chart reasoning, our
approach enhances model robustness and generalization across diverse chart
styles and domains, resulting in a state-of-the-art chart reasoning model,
BigCharts-R1. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models surpass
existing methods on multiple chart question-answering benchmarks compared to
even larger open-source and closed-source models.

*Aishik Mandal,Prottay Kumar Adhikary,Hiba Arnaout,Iryna Gurevych,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys clinical mental health datasets for AI development, highlighting gaps like lack of longitudinal data and cultural diversity, and provides recommendations for better datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in mental health disorders and shortage of clinicians necessitates AI assistance, but current datasets are scattered and inadequate, hindering AI model development.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey of clinical mental health datasets, categorizing them by disorder, modality, task, accessibility, and sociocultural context, and analyze synthetic datasets.

Result: Identified gaps include limited longitudinal data, cultural/linguistic diversity, inconsistent standards, and synthetic data shortcomings.

Conclusion: The paper outlines challenges and actionable recommendations to improve dataset quality for more robust and equitable mental health AI systems.

Abstract: Mental health disorders are rising worldwide. However, the availability of
trained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without
adequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the
promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis,
monitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable,
and ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality
clinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for
training clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,
under-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,
comparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental
health care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of
clinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of
AI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental
disorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,
speech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom
severity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,
restricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural
background). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental
health datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of
longitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent
collection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic
data. We conclude by outlining key challenges in curating and standardizing
future datasets and provide actionable recommendations to facilitate the
development of more robust, generalizable, and equitable mental health AI
systems.

TL;DR: A survey on innovative LLM architectures addressing transformer limitations to improve efficiency, covering methods like linear/sparse modeling, efficient attention variants, and hybrid models, with applications across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transformer architectures are computationally intensive, hindering large-scale training and deployment. This survey explores alternatives to enhance efficiency.

Method: Systematic examination of methods including linear/sparse sequence modeling, efficient attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid architectures, and diffusion LLMs.

Result: Provides a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, grouping recent studies to highlight advancements.

Conclusion: The survey aims to inspire future research toward more efficient and versatile AI systems by addressing transformer limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language
understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of
multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer
a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional
transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses
significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In
this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures
that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency.
Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and
technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient
full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures
incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally,
we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider
their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation
models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey
presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this
could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI
systems.

*Mo Yu,Tsz Ting Chung,Chulun Zhou,Tong Li,Rui Lu,Jiangnan Li,Liyan Xu,Haoshu Lu,Ning Zhang,Jing Li,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRELUDE is a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding by assessing the consistency of prequel stories with original narratives, revealing significant gaps in model performance compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning required to evaluate long-context understanding. PRELUDE addresses this by focusing on prequel consistency, which involves integrating indirect information.

Method: The benchmark tasks models with determining prequel plausibility, requiring evidence from multiple narrative parts. Evaluations include in-context learning, RAG, in-domain training with LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services.

Result: Models lag behind humans by >15%, with a 30% gap in reasoning accuracy due to flawed reasoning despite correct answers.

Conclusion: PRELUDE highlights the challenge of long-context understanding and reasoning, showing substantial room for improvement in current models.

Abstract: We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding
through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is
consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a
stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing
benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing
their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information
that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence
from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the
challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with
state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans
by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct
answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy
compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for
improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates lightweight Whisper models (Tiny, Base, Small) for Urdu speech recognition in low-resource settings, finding Whisper-Small performs best (33.68% WER) but challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu, the 10th most spoken language, lacks robust ASR systems due to dialectal diversity, code-switching, and limited data.

Method: Benchmarked Whisper models on a curated Urdu dataset using WER without fine-tuning.

Result: Whisper-Small achieved the lowest WER (33.68%), outperforming Tiny (67.08%) and Base (53.67%).

Conclusion: Whisper-Small shows promise for Urdu ASR, but phonetic and lexical challenges persist, calling for further research.

Abstract: This study evaluates the feasibility of lightweight Whisper models (Tiny,
Base, Small) for Urdu speech recognition in low-resource settings. Despite Urdu
being the 10th most spoken language globally with over 230 million speakers,
its representation in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems remains
limited due to dialectal diversity, code-switching, and sparse training data.
We benchmark these models on a curated Urdu dataset using word error rate
(WER), without fine-tuning. Results show Whisper-Small achieves the lowest
error rates (33.68\% WER), outperforming Tiny (67.08\% WER) and Base (53.67\%
WER). Qualitative analysis reveals persistent challenges in phonetic accuracy
and lexical coherence, particularly for complex utterances. While Whisper-Small
demonstrates promise for deployable Urdu ASR, significant gaps remain. Our
findings emphasize lay the groundwork for future research into effective,
low-resource ASR systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Memory Decoder is a plug-and-play pretrained memory for efficient domain adaptation of LLMs, avoiding costly training and inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to specific domains is challenging due to high costs of methods like DAPT and latency issues in RAG.

Method: Uses a small transformer decoder to mimic an external retriever, integrating seamlessly with any pretrained model.

Result: Reduces perplexity by 6.17 points on average across biomedicine, finance, and law domains.

Conclusion: Memory Decoder offers a novel, efficient paradigm for domain adaptation without modifying original model parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language
tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current
method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter
training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency
due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper
introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables
efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters.
Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the
behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder
can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the
same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results
demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen
and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance,
and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory
Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory
component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can
be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance
across multiple models within the target domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation and inconsistencies in CD taxonomies, task formulations, and evaluation practices in NLP for mental health.

Method: Review of 38 studies over two decades, analyzing datasets, modeling approaches, and evaluation strategies.

Result: Provides a consolidated CD taxonomy, common task setups, and identifies open challenges for coherent research.

Conclusion: The survey aims to support reproducible and unified research in NLP for cognitive distortions.

Abstract: As interest grows in the application of natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to mental health, a growing body of work explores the automatic
detection and classification of cognitive distortions (CDs). CDs are habitual
patterns of negatively biased or flawed thinking that distort how people
perceive events, judge themselves, and react to the world around them.
Identifying and addressing them is an important part of therapy. Despite its
momentum, the field remains fragmented, with inconsistencies in CD taxonomies,
task formulations, and evaluation practices. This survey reviews 38 studies
spanning two decades, providing a structured overview of datasets, modelling
approaches, and evaluation strategies. We provide a consolidated CD taxonomy
reference, summarise common task setups, and highlight open challenges to
support more coherent and reproducible research in this emerging area.

*Sayem Hossen,Monalisa Moon Joti,Md. Golam Rashed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how digitization in business communication enables both transparency and deception, proposing a method to detect deceptive language using persuasive lexicon with high accuracy, though multilingual applications face challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical and empirical representations of communication by detecting deceptive language in digital business discourse.

Method: Combines classical rhetoric, communication psychology, linguistic theory, and empirical studies, using computational textual analysis and personalized transformer models.

Result: Achieved over 99% detection accuracy in controlled settings, but multilingual applications are hindered by data scarcity and lack of infrastructure.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for robust AI-based text-identification systems as digital communication becomes more realistic and complex.

Abstract: Business communication digitisation has reorganised the process of persuasive
discourse, which
  allows not only greater transparency but also advanced deception. This
inquiry synthesises classical
  rhetoric and communication psychology with linguistic theory and empirical
studies in the financial
  reporting, sustainability discourse, and digital marketing to explain how
deceptive language can be
  systematically detected using persuasive lexicon. In controlled settings,
detection accuracies of greater
  than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as
personalised transformer
  models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is
also problematic and,
  to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data,
and because few multilingual
  text-processing infrastructures are in place. This evidence shows that there
has been an increasing
  gap between the theoretical representations of communication and those
empirically approximated,
  and therefore, there is a need to have strong automatic text-identification
systems where AI-based
  discourse is becoming more realistic in communicating with humans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for comparing alignment techniques in LLMs, assessing detection, quality, efficiency, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified evaluation frameworks for comparing diverse alignment approaches in LLMs, ensuring safe and value-aligned outputs.

Method: Develops a comprehensive framework evaluating alignment techniques across four dimensions: detection, quality, computational efficiency, and robustness.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's utility in identifying strengths and limitations of current alignment methods through experiments.

Conclusion: Provides insights for future research and deployment decisions in LLM alignment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and
safety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment
approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction
tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each
with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified
evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these
paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a
multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive
evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major
alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:
alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and
robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment
strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying
strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing
valuable insights for future research directions.

TL;DR: VisCodex introduces a unified framework merging vision and coding models to enhance multimodal code generation, supported by the Multimodal Coding Dataset and InfiBench-V benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack strong multimodal code generation capabilities, prompting the need for a unified solution.

Method: Task vector-based model merging integrates a coding LLM into a vision-language backbone, preserving both visual and coding skills.

Result: VisCodex achieves state-of-the-art performance, nearing proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The framework and datasets effectively advance multimodal code generation in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced the
integration of visual and textual understanding. However, their ability to
generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we
introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and
coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation
abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate
a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while
preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support
training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a
large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML
code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic
problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging
benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world
programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and
visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary
models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain-specific tokenizers improve radiology report summarization, outperforming general and medical tokenizers, especially when trained from scratch. Pre-training reduces performance gaps, but domain-specific tokenizers remain superior, also reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of tokenizers (vocabulary) on text generation quality in radiology is under-explored. This work aims to systematically compare general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers for radiology report summarization.

Method: Comparison of general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers for radiology report summarization across three imaging modalities, with and without pre-training on PubMed abstracts.

Result: Medical and domain-specific tokenizers outperform general ones when trained from scratch. Pre-training mitigates differences, but domain-specific tokenizers achieve the best results and reduce memory usage.

Conclusion: Adapting LM vocabularies to the clinical domain enhances performance and efficiency, making models more practical for healthcare applications.

Abstract: The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer -
plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains
under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by
systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on
the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We
also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed
abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific
vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models
are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance
differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve
the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory
requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results
demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides
practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational
demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and
real-world healthcare settings.

*Johannes Schäfer,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve emotion annotation reliability by adding contextual narratives to event descriptions, showing enhanced consistency in annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion analysis is ambiguous, and prior work ignored contextual information as a source of disagreement. This study aims to explore if enriched contexts improve annotation reliability.

Method: The approach generates multiple event chains conditioned on emotions, using short story generation techniques to create coherent narratives for contextualized emotion analysis.

Result: Contextual narratives improve emotion interpretation and lead to more consistent annotations, as confirmed by automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Adding reasonable contexts to event descriptions enhances the reliability of emotion annotations, addressing ambiguity in emotion analysis.

Abstract: Emotion analysis is an inherently ambiguous task. Previous work studied
annotator properties to explain disagreement, but this overlooks the
possibility that ambiguity may stem from missing information about the context
of events. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that adds reasonable
contexts to event descriptions, which may better explain a particular
situation. Our goal is to understand whether these enriched contexts enable
human annotators to annotate emotions more reliably. We disambiguate a target
event description by automatically generating multiple event chains conditioned
on differing emotions. By combining techniques from short story generation in
various settings, we achieve coherent narratives that result in a specialized
dataset for the first comprehensive and systematic examination of
contextualized emotion analysis. Through automatic and human evaluation, we
find that contextual narratives enhance the interpretation of specific emotions
and support annotators in producing more consistent annotations.

TL;DR: GPT-5-high outperforms other models in accuracy and rationale quality for medical QA tasks, with GPT-5-mini-low offering a cost-effective balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal configurations of GPT-5 for maximizing accuracy and cost-efficiency in complex medical question-answering tasks.

Method: Evaluated 12 GPT-5 configurations alongside o1-high, o3-high, and GPT-4o using 260 ophthalmology questions. Metrics included accuracy, rationale quality, and cost-accuracy trade-offs.

Result: GPT-5-high achieved the highest accuracy (0.965) and rationale quality, outperforming most models. GPT-5-mini-low was identified as cost-effective.

Conclusion: GPT-5 configurations can be optimized for performance and cost, with GPT-5-high leading in accuracy and rationale quality, while GPT-5-mini-low offers a practical balance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-5 integrate advanced reasoning
capabilities that may improve performance on complex medical question-answering
tasks. For this latest generation of reasoning models, the configurations that
maximize both accuracy and cost-efficiency have yet to be established. We
evaluated 12 configurations of OpenAI's GPT-5 series (three model tiers across
four reasoning effort settings) alongside o1-high, o3-high, and GPT-4o, using
260 closed-access multiple-choice questions from the American Academy of
Ophthalmology Basic Clinical Science Course (BCSC) dataset. The primary outcome
was multiple-choice accuracy; secondary outcomes included head-to-head ranking
via a Bradley-Terry model, rationale quality assessment using a
reference-anchored, pairwise LLM-as-a-judge framework, and analysis of
accuracy-cost trade-offs using token-based cost estimates. GPT-5-high achieved
the highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano
variants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high
(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x
stronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).
Cost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto
frontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,
high-performance balance. These results benchmark GPT-5 on a high-quality
ophthalmology dataset, demonstrate the influence of reasoning effort on
accuracy, and introduce an autograder framework for scalable evaluation of
LLM-generated answers against reference standards in ophthalmology.

### [179] [Which one Performs Better? Wav2Vec or Whisper? Applying both in Badini Kurdish Speech to Text (BKSTT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09957)
*Renas Adnan,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of speech-to-text (STT) systems for the Badini Kurdish dialect by developing a language model using Badini kids' stories. Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 outperformed Whisper-small in accuracy and readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in STT systems for the Badini Kurdish dialect, aiding its speakers in technology use and increasing global visibility.

Method: Used Badini kids' stories (78 stories from 8 books) as textual input, recorded by six narrators (~17 hours). Preprocessed data (~15 hours, 19193 segments, 25221 words) and tested Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and Whisper-small models.

Result: Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 achieved 90.38% readability and 82.67% accuracy, outperforming Whisper-small (65.45% readability, 53.17% accuracy).

Conclusion: The Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model is more effective for Badini STT, demonstrating potential for less-resourced languages.

Abstract: Speech-to-text (STT) systems have a wide range of applications. They are
available in many languages, albeit at different quality levels. Although
Kurdish is considered a less-resourced language from a processing perspective,
SST is available for some of the Kurdish dialects, for instance, Sorani
(Central Kurdish). However, that is not applied to other Kurdish dialects,
Badini and Hawrami, for example. This research is an attempt to address this
gap. Bandin, approximately, has two million speakers, and STT systems can help
their community use mobile and computer-based technologies while giving their
dialect more global visibility. We aim to create a language model based on
Badini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,
have a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready
transcriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78
stories, as the textual input. Six narrators narrated the books, which resulted
in approximately 17 hours of recording. We cleaned, segmented, and tokenized
the input. The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including
19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and
Whisper-small to develop the language models. The experiments indicate that the
transcriptions process based on the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model provides a
significantly more accurate and readable output than the Whisper-small model,
with 90.38% and 65.45% readability, and 82.67% and 53.17% accuracy,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A neural contextual bandit-based algorithm is proposed to select sequences of LLMs for complex tasks, improving performance and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs for specialized tasks requires strategies to predict successful LLM sequences, as single LLMs may struggle with complex or specialized queries.

Method: A neural contextual bandit algorithm trains neural networks to model LLM success on subtasks, guiding selections dynamically.

Result: Experiments show the approach outperforms existing LLM selection algorithms in tasks like telecommunications QA and medical diagnosis.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles complex dependencies in sequential LLM selection, enhancing task success and cost efficiency.

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety
of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict
which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This
problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft
allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular
types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized
and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often
benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can
then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.
For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first
select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,
and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from
the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,
this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of
each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,
unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly
affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,
creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted
for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm
that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online
manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,
even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on
telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM
selection algorithms.

### [181] [Efficient Real-Time Aircraft ETA Prediction via Feature Tokenization Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09144)
*Liping Huang,Yicheng Zhang,Yifang Yin,Sheng Zhang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer model with feature tokenization is proposed for real-time ETA prediction of aircraft, outperforming XGBoost in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time ETA prediction is critical for efficient arrival management in aviation, requiring both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: A feature tokenization-based Transformer model is used to process raw data (e.g., position, speed, weather) and predict ETA at 1Hz frequency.

Result: The model improves accuracy by 7% over XGBoost and reduces computing time by 61%, with inference times as low as 51.7 microseconds for 40 aircraft.

Conclusion: The proposed method is highly effective for real-time ETA prediction, making it suitable for practical arrival management systems.

Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial
for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given
the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as
important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In
this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to
efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to
latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer
captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex
feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation
capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,
which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs
include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta
degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and
aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA
prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA
prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using
one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October
1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers
all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that
our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based
model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\%
of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40
aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only
51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management
systems.

### [182] [MoLAN: A Unified Modality-Aware Noise Dynamic Editing Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09145)
*Xingle Xu,Yongkang Liu,Dexian Cai,Shi Feng,Xiaocui Yang,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoLAN is a framework for fine-grained noise suppression in multimodal sentiment analysis, dynamically adjusting denoising strength per modality block. MoLAN+ achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods risk losing critical information by treating entire modalities as independent units for noise suppression.

Method: MoLAN divides modality features into blocks, dynamically assigning denoising strength based on noise level and semantic relevance.

Result: MoLAN+ outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: MoLAN provides a flexible, unified framework for effective multimodal sentiment analysis, preserving essential information while suppressing noise.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions.
However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory
information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality
information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an
independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the
redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To
address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise
dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking
by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is
then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise
level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while
preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and
flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of
multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a
new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and
four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework.
Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art
performance. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/betterfly123/MoLAN-Framework.

### [183] [To Theoretically Understand Transformer-Based In-Context Learning for Optimizing CSMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09146)
*Shugang Hao,Hongbo Li,Lingjie Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) approach to optimize WiFi 7's channel access, addressing throughput issues caused by inaccurate node density estimation in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-based backoff strategies in WiFi 7 perform poorly due to inaccurate node density estimation, leading to throughput loss.

Method: A transformer-based ICL optimizer is designed to predict contention window thresholds (CWT) using pre-collected collision data and queries. An efficient training algorithm ensures near-optimal predictions, even with imperfect data.

Result: The approach achieves near-optimal throughput and fast convergence, outperforming existing model-based and DRL-based methods under unknown node densities.

Conclusion: The transformer-based ICL method effectively optimizes channel access in dynamic environments, minimizing throughput loss and prediction deviations.

Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still
incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent
model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply
optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading
to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This
paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)
theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL
optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query
collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the
transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention
window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop
an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within
limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for
ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt.
We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput
deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further
demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over
existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.

*TaekHyun Park,Yongjae Lee,Daesan Park,Dohee Kim,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JustDense replaces complex sequence mixers with dense layers in time series analysis, showing comparable or better performance, challenging the need for intricate designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies question the necessity of complex sequence mixers in time series analysis, suggesting simpler architectures may suffice.

Method: JustDense substitutes sequence mixers in established models with dense layers, isolating mixing operations for clarity.

Result: Experiments on 29 benchmarks show dense layers match or outperform complex mixers, questioning deeper architectures' superiority.

Conclusion: JustDense demonstrates that simpler dense layers can replace complex sequence mixers, challenging traditional assumptions in time series analysis.

Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have
become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent
studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as
attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve
comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits
attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other
architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a
central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series
analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that
systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models
with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any
sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This
substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical
foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive
experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven
state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show
that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even
superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer
benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex
architectures are inherently better" in TSA.

### [186] [Peer Effect Estimation in the Presence of Simultaneous Feedback and Unobserved Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09154)
*Xiaojing Du,Jiuyong Li,Lin Liu,Debo Cheng,Thuc. Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIG2RSI is a deep learning framework using I-G transformation and 2SRI to address simultaneous feedback and unobserved confounders in peer effect estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in estimating peer effects due to simultaneous feedback and unobserved confounders in networks, with existing methods failing to address both issues effectively.

Method: DIG2RSI applies I-G transformation to disentangle peer influences and uses 2SRI with neural networks to handle unobserved confounders, incorporating adversarial debiasing.

Result: Proven consistent estimator; outperforms existing methods on semi-synthetic benchmarks and real-world data.

Conclusion: DIG2RSI effectively addresses feedback and confounding, providing accurate peer effect estimation with deep learning and adversarial techniques.

Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as
social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between
peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved
confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback
but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer
effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning
framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an
instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback
and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and
high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to
disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the
simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct
valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on
these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the
unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network
augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as
a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no
residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in
capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances
the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and
hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard
regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.
Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset
demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.

*Wenkai Wang,Hongcan Guo,Zheqi Lv,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaPO is an online RL framework for LMMs that adaptively adjusts training objectives to prevent reward hacking, enhancing self-evaluation and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for self-evaluation in LMMs suffer from reward hacking and model collapse due to fixed rewards.

Method: AdaPO uses an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization to dynamically adjust objectives.

Result: Improves reasoning and self-evaluation across 8 benchmarks without manual intervention.

Conclusion: AdaPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and enhances LMM performance, with plans to release code.

Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own
output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve
self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation
models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward
hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model
collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning
framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time
according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to
mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a
Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's
training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn
trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty
with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between
different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly
adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual
intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show
that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and
self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the
community.

TL;DR: A framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems, ensuring physical consistency and accurate parameter recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enforcing physical constraints and solving inverse problems in scientific systems using generative models, while maintaining data-driven and physics-aware approaches.

Method: Differentiable post-training procedure minimizes weak-form residuals of PDEs, augmented with a learnable latent parameter predictor and joint optimization for unknown inputs.

Result: Improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients, validated on canonical PDE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Bridges generative modeling and scientific inference, enabling simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modeling of physical systems.

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to
enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems.
Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a
differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency
and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned
distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material
parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a
learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy.
The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside
plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed
inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our
method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE
constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges
generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for
simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical
systems.

TL;DR: EvaDrive introduces a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving, enabling iterative trajectory refinement via adversarial optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods isolate trajectory generation from evaluation or collapse preferences into scalar rewards, limiting human-like decision-making.

Method: EvaDrive uses adversarial optimization with a hierarchical generator and multi-objective critic, preserving preference diversity.

Result: Achieves 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 and 64.96 Driving Score on Bench2Drive, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: EvaDrive offers a scalarization-free, human-like iterative decision-making approach for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like
iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines
trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate
trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement
essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse
multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical
trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present
EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that
establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and
evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as
a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator
continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent
modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial
flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable
multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures
without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial
interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative
multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving
trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks
demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing
DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving
Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic
weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop
adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a
novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.

TL;DR: This paper integrates 15 datasets to create a large database for T1D research, focusing on hypoglycemia prediction using ML, and analyzes data quality and glucose-heart rate correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of large datasets in T1D and hypoglycemia research, which limits ML-based glucose prediction and early warnings.

Method: The method involves systematically integrating 15 datasets into a large database (2510 subjects, 149M measurements), assessing data quality, and studying glucose-heart rate correlations.

Result: The result is a comprehensive database with balanced demographics, revealing data imbalance and missing values as challenges, and identifying a glucose-heart rate correlation 15-55 minutes before hypoglycemia.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the database's potential for advancing T1D research and the need to address data quality issues for reliable ML applications.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction
of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the
affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin
can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a
severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side
effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance
diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse
events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and
provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by
the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates
15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose
measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are
included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two
sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and
sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an
equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution,
data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values
present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose
levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55
minutes before hypoglycemia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate energy forecasting is crucial for sustainability in buildings, but existing methods (deep learning and physics-based models) have limitations like reliance on historical data or extensive parameter requirements.

Method: PgMN integrates deep learning and physics-based models using Parallel Projection Layers, a Memory Unit, and a Memory Experience Module for improved forecasting.

Result: PgMN shows high accuracy in diverse scenarios, including new buildings, missing data, and dynamic changes, proving its applicability.

Conclusion: PgMN offers a robust solution for energy forecasting in dynamic environments, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource
management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are
highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable
when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings.
On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy
consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building
parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper
introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that
integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address
their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process
incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory
Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and
produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are
mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was
evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical
for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems.
Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse
scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical
data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising
solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments,
enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or
unavailable or when physics-based models are inadequate.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised explainable AI framework to detect and characterize replay attacks in nuclear reactor data, achieving high accuracy with real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is critical for safe nuclear reactor operation, but current methods lack root-cause analysis and rely on unrealistic assumptions.

Method: Combines autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm for real-time detection, source identification, and characterization of replay attacks.

Result: Achieved 95% or better accuracy in detecting and identifying replay attacks on real-world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor.

Conclusion: The proposed XAI framework effectively addresses gaps in current methods, providing reliable and explainable detection of replay attacks in dynamic nuclear systems.

Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in
size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and
control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in
the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non
linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states.
Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly
important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable
operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus
on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further
identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition,
these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian
process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to
univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other
linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled
system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems,
additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and
explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised
explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized
windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e.,
detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity
during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was
benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1
with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI
framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals
being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy efficiency in SC NNs for IoT by exploring mixed-precision layer-wise implementations.

Method: Proposes ASL with operator-norm-based modeling, RF regression for sensitivity analysis, and two truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained).

Result: ASL reduces energy and latency by over 60% with negligible accuracy loss in a 32nm SC MLP.

Conclusion: ASL is feasible for IoT, showcasing mixed-precision truncation benefits in SC designs.

Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative
for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the
Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC
significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional
floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise
mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article
introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies
mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an
operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise
can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification
factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest
(RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the
alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To
accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two
truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse
sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP
synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency
overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the
feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct
advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.

*Min Tang,Peng Lu,Qing Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model-based method for population synthesis outperforms VAEs and GANs by better balancing feasibility and diversity in synthetic populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Population synthesis is crucial for agent-based modeling in transportation systems, but survey data often lacks density for high-dimensional attribute distributions, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model-based approach to estimate the joint distribution of population attributes, recovering missing sampling zeros while minimizing structural zeros.

Result: The method outperforms VAE and GAN approaches in metrics like marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and diversity.

Conclusion: The diffusion model-based method effectively addresses the challenges of population synthesis, offering improved accuracy and balance.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic
yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in
agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze
intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the
primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents
represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes
describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the
joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of
dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and
produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from
available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute
combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the
sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of
falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in
the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion
model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying
joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of
numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros
minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as
Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population
synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range
of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and
diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and
diversity of the synthesized population.

TL;DR: PatchECG is a framework for adaptive variable block count missing representation learning in ECGs, addressing layout differences and improving arrhythmia diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG layouts vary across hospitals, causing asynchronous lead time and blackout loss, challenging existing models.

Method: PatchECG uses a masking training strategy to focus on key patches with collaborative dependencies between leads.

Result: Achieved AUROC of 0.835 on PTB-XL, 0.778 in external validation, and 0.893 on 12x1 layouts, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PatchECG is robust across ECG layouts and superior to existing methods, enhancing arrhythmia diagnosis.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by
different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and
partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To
address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive
variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking
training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with
collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of
arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the
PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit
tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated
strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged
with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data
from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached
0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to
various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current
optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and
0.19.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of converting creative ideas into precise vector graphics efficiently.

Method: Introduces SVG-1M dataset with aligned text-SVG pairs and Chain of Thought annotations. Proposes SVGen, an end-to-end model using curriculum and reinforcement learning.

Result: SVGen outperforms general large models and traditional rendering methods in effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: SVG-1M and SVGen provide a scalable solution for text-to-SVG generation, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is widely used in front-end development and
UI/UX design due to its scalability, editability, and rendering efficiency.
However, turning creative ideas into precise vector graphics remains a
time-consuming challenge. To address this, we introduce SVG-1M, a large-scale
dataset of high-quality SVGs paired with natural language descriptions. Through
advanced data augmentation and annotation, we create well-aligned Text to SVG
training pairs, including a subset with Chain of Thought annotations for
enhanced semantic guidance. Based on this dataset, we propose SVGen, an
end-to-end model that generates SVG code from natural language inputs. Our
approach ensures semantic accuracy and structural completeness, supported by
curriculum learning and reinforcement learning optimization. Experiments show
that SVGen outperforms general large models and traditional rendering methods
in both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and dataset are available on

*Amit Kumar Jaiswal,Haiming Liu,Ingo Frommholz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, training-free method using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and linear mapping to bridge the modality gap in large multimodal models (LMMs), improving textual description generation for images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high cost and impracticality of fine-tuning LMMs to align textual and visual representations, and the modality gap issue.

Method: Proposes RAG with linear mapping for efficient modality alignment, using retrieved textual descriptions and iterative synthetic description generation for optimization.

Result: Significant improvements demonstrated on two benchmark multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the modality gap without expensive fine-tuning, enhancing multimodal description generation.

Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of
queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address
challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with
pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large
multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a
misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common
embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is
typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive
domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight
training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend
across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently.
During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling
retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual
descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for
the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we
introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating
synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for
standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two
benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

TL;DR: FedMP improves federated learning (FL) under non-IID data by using stochastic feature manifold completion and class-prototypes, outperforming existing methods on medical and natural image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in FL caused by non-IID data, especially in medical imaging, where feature distribution shifts hinder model performance.

Method: Proposes FedMP, which uses stochastic feature manifold completion and class-prototypes to align feature manifolds and improve decision boundaries.

Result: FedMP outperforms existing FL algorithms on medical and multi-domain natural image datasets, with analysis on manifold dimensionality, communication, and privacy.

Conclusion: FedMP effectively enhances FL performance in non-IID scenarios, validated by experiments and additional analyses.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which
multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their
local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter
challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed
(non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly
pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature
distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method
designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic
feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client
classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature
manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating
the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the
effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those
with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain
natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP
outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of
manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of
feature exposure in our method.

### [199] [DQT: Dynamic Quantization Training via Dequantization-Free Nested Integer Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09176)
*Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby,Fabrizio Pittorino,Francesca Palermo,Diana Trojaniello,Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DQT introduces a dynamic quantization framework with nested integer representation and integer-only arithmetic, enabling efficient bit-width switching and outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic quantization methods require costly dequantize-requantize cycles, breaking integer-only hardware paradigms and limiting performance gains.

Method: DQT uses a nested integer representation and custom integer-only arithmetic for on-the-fly bit-width switching via bit-shift operations, eliminating dequantization overhead.

Result: DQT achieves 77.00% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet50, outperforming static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET, 76.94%) methods at comparable BitOPs, with only 28.3M bit-shift operations.

Conclusion: DQT unlocks efficient, adaptive AI by enabling dequantization-free mixed-precision and dynamic quantization with minimal overhead, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies
on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width
to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,
instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.
However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly
dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,
breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.
This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework
that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer
representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within
higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only
arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost
bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable
both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and
truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight
controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate
DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on
ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1
accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,
76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this
with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a
drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a
new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: scAGC is a novel single-cell clustering method that learns adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods struggle with high dimensionality and noise in scRNA-seq data, and existing graph-based methods rely on static graphs that fail to capture long-tailed distributions.

Method: scAGC uses a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax sampling, ZINB loss for feature reconstruction, and contrastive learning for stable graph refinement.

Result: scAGC achieves the best NMI and ARI scores on 9 and 7 out of 9 real scRNA-seq datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: scAGC effectively addresses challenges in single-cell clustering by dynamically refining graph structures and leveraging contrastive learning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular
heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero
elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant
statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph
neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static
graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the
long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these
limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns
adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature
representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.
Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages
a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the
graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem
of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood
structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of
scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for
robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is
incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt
changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence.
Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI
and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at
Anonymous Github.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LCSFLA, a truthful auction-based client selection method for federated learning in IoV, addressing non-IID data challenges and ensuring long-term data quality and truthful client participation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning in IoV faces issues like non-IID data, resource wastage, and information asymmetry in client selection, impacting model convergence and accuracy.

Method: Introduces LCSFLA, combining long-term data quality assessment and a truthful auction mechanism with deposits to incentivize honest participation.

Result: Theoretical proof shows incentive compatibility and individual rationality. Experiments confirm effectiveness in mitigating non-IID data issues.

Conclusion: LCSFLA improves federated learning in IoV by addressing client selection challenges and ensuring truthful, efficient participation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables
universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as
smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a
mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This
method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training
data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and
environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and
accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID
issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics
evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client
selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource
wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have
limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in
client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making
the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction
(LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term
data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised
auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation
and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive
compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism.
Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios,
demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by
non-IID data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection to mitigate safety risks in fine-tuned LLMs by integrating multi-scale safety layer-neuron interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs introduces safety risks, and existing post-fine-tuning defenses lack comprehensive consideration of safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting safety-utility balance.

Method: FGSN localizes precise safety neurons and projects their parameters onto safety directions, minimizing interference with task neurons. It includes a task-specific, multi-dimensional optimization mechanism for continual defense.

Result: Experiments show FGSN reduces harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter changes, preserving model utility.

Conclusion: FGSN effectively balances safety and utility in fine-tuned LLMs and generalizes against emerging safety concerns.

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language
models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and
introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for
the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most
post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These
methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and
fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and
utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)
with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety
risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety
layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety
neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then
project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model
safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive
experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method
significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal
parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by
introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron
cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization
capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

TL;DR: TokenCast is an LLM-driven framework for context-aware time series forecasting by unifying numerical and textual data via symbolic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving forecasting accuracy by integrating historical numerical sequences with unstructured contextual features.

Method: Uses a discrete tokenizer for numerical sequences, aligns tokens in a shared LLM-based space, and fine-tunes for prediction.

Result: Effective and generalizable performance on diverse datasets with contextual features.

Conclusion: TokenCast successfully bridges the gap between numerical and textual data for enhanced forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making
across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and
finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to
the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual
features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this
challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages
language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for
context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a
discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal
tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the
semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are
embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language
model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives.
Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently
fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are
then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on
diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D2F enhances dLLMs for faster inference by combining autoregressive and diffusion methods, achieving significant speedups over AR LLMs and vanilla dLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dLLMs lack superior inference speed compared to AR LLMs, prompting the need for a hybrid approach.

Method: Introduces D2F, enabling block-wise autoregressive generation and inter-block parallel decoding via asymmetric distillation.

Result: D2F dLLMs achieve 2.5× speed over LLaMA3/Qwen2.5 and 50× over vanilla dLLMs, maintaining quality.

Conclusion: D2F successfully bridges the efficiency gap in dLLMs, offering a practical hybrid paradigm for faster text generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential
to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing
open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of
similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective
strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key
capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache
utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of
prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs
are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.
D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on
pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,
which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F
dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and
Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the
acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable
output quality. The code is available at

procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the
expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective

Method: Introduces a meta-learning-based framework that learns from historical performance data to select the best acceleration techniques for specific tasks.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional methods, streamlining decision-making and enhancing system efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for decentralized AI, promoting more democratic and feasible AI deployment.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs),
incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these
costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is
a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where
choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage

work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in
decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This
framework automates the selection process by learning from historical
performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks.
Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition,
our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based
on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our
meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but
also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and
performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in
decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and

to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon
distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex
sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight,
despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance
plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make
sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with
each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing
scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision
Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution
policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online
decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves
this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios,
sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient
iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on
real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

TL;DR: MoQE is a quantization inference framework using Mixture-of-Experts to improve model performance by dynamically routing inputs to specialized quantization experts, reducing accuracy degradation without significant latency increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization improves efficiency but often degrades accuracy. MoQE aims to mitigate this by leveraging multiple quantization experts.

Method: MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of a full-precision model as experts, using lightweight routers to dynamically route inputs.

Result: MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization models on benchmarks like ImageNet and WikiText, with minimal latency impact.

Conclusion: MoQE effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in quantized models, making it suitable for resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and
reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning
models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process
inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture
of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based
on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the
performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization
variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and
dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its
characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in
single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models.
We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and
NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families
across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText
demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization
model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

TL;DR: A novel repair algorithm for laser-enabled selective transfer in microLED fabrication reduces transfer steps by 50% and achieves fast planning times, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput microLED fabrication requires efficient shift sequence planning to minimize XY stage motion and adapt to varying optimization objectives.

Method: The proposed algorithm uses a differentiable transfer module for discrete shifts, trainable via gradient-based optimization, eliminating the need for handcrafted features and enabling flexible objective designs.

Result: Achieves 50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000 arrays, outperforming local proximity and RL-based methods.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, adaptable solution for accelerating microLED repair in AR/VR and display fabrication.

Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED
fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to
minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives
across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a
differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer
platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared
to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair
performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the
number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our
method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains
significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a
50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000
arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for

*Sameer Ambekar,Daniel M. Lang,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hi-Vec introduces hierarchical adaptive networks with task vectors for dynamic test-time adaptation, improving robustness and handling diverse distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods for test-time adaptation rely on single-dimensional linear layers, which struggle with complex shifts. Hi-Vec aims to address this limitation.

Method: Hi-Vec uses hierarchical layers for dynamic adaptation, featuring dynamic layer selection, weight merging, and linear layer agreement to prevent noisy fine-tuning.

Result: Hi-Vec outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing robustness, handling uncertainty, and adapting to limited batch sizes and outliers.

Conclusion: Hi-Vec effectively addresses diverse distribution shifts, offering a plug-and-play solution for existing methods to improve test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data
streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains.
However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification
layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose
Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages
multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By
decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically
organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to
adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First,
we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal
layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that
merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers
receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts
as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy
batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging
scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to
advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves
robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and
increased outlier rates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSMT is a hybrid model combining GAT and RNN with a task corrector for accurate bus trajectory prediction in urban areas with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bus trajectory prediction is vital for intelligent transportation, especially in regions with limited multimodal data.

Method: GSMT integrates GAT and RNN, uses a task corrector to cluster historical trajectories, and refines predictions in two stages.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in short- and long-term predictions on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur.

Conclusion: GSMT effectively addresses trajectory prediction challenges in dense urban traffic with limited data.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent
transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing
regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard
GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this
problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and
incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns
from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical
trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the
predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus
information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to
perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary
refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach
enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban
traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a
real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance
in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based prototype estimation framework for tabular learning, using example-free prompts to generate feature values and build zero-shot prototypes, scalable and robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in utilizing advanced LLMs for few-shot and zero-shot tabular data modeling.

Method: Proposes an LLM-based prototype estimation framework using example-free prompts to generate feature values and build prototypes without training.

Result: Effective in zero and few-shot tabular learning, scalable and robust.

Conclusion: The framework bypasses example-based prompt constraints, offering a practical solution for tabular learning with LLMs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However,
effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is
still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype
estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to
generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task
and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can
build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further
enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or
finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype
estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt,
providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning-based system for robust single-trial odor detection using olfactory bulb LFPs, achieving high accuracy and outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current odor detection methods struggle with complex mixtures and lack reliable single-trial fidelity, necessitating a general system for robust detection.

Method: An ensemble of ResCNN and AttentionCNN models decodes odor presence from multichannel olfactory bulb LFPs, tested on 2,349 trials from awake mice.

Result: The model achieved 86.6% accuracy, 81.0% F1-score, and 0.9247 AUC, supporting the hypotheses and outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of single-trial odor detection from LFPs and highlights deep learning's potential for understanding olfactory representations.

Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical
diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for
odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings
lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor
detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two
hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are
sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from
the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an
ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and
AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory
bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble
model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score
of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous
benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework
captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the
feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from
extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning
models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.

### [217] [Over-Squashing in GNNs and Causal Inference of Rewiring Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09265)
*Danial Saber,Amirali Salehi-Abari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses over-squashing in GNNs, proposes metrics to measure it, and evaluates rewiring techniques' effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-squashing limits GNN expressivity, but rewiring's impact is unclear due to lack of empirical metrics.

Method: Proposes topology-focused metrics for over-squashing, extends to graph-level stats, and tests rewiring on benchmarks.

Result: Rewiring mitigates over-squashing in graph classification, but effects vary. Node classification shows less impact, and aggressive rewiring can harm performance.

Conclusion: Rewiring is beneficial when over-squashing is significant and corrected moderately; a diagnostic tool helps pre-training decisions.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance
across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and
drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --
exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which
limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their
practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical
over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for
assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their
mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four
graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).
Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how
rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and
node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most
graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various
extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of
mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and
method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node
classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and
performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These
findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both
substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,
or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and
may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners
decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) under realistic adversarial conditions, proposing efficient perturbation algorithms to misalign agents' perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on c-MARL vulnerabilities in realistic adversarial scenarios, where attackers can only perturb observations or have no access.

Method: Proposes simple yet effective algorithms for adversarial perturbations, tested on three benchmarks and 22 environments.

Result: The approach is highly effective across diverse algorithms and environments, requiring only 1,000 samples (vs. millions in prior work).

Conclusion: The study highlights significant vulnerabilities in c-MARL under realistic adversarial conditions, with efficient attack methods.

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly
evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications,
including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread
adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to
adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time
attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the
ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new
vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an
adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We
also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose
simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations
designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach
is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating
its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we
show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples
compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

TL;DR: A novel, explainable framework for automated Knowledge Component (KC) discovery in CS education uses pattern-based KCs from student code, improving learning modeling and predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of student knowledge in CS education is challenging due to the open-ended nature of programming and structural variability in solutions.

Method: Uses a Variational Autoencoder and attention-based code representation to extract and cluster recurring structural patterns in student code as KCs.

Result: Demonstrates meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) predictive performance.

Conclusion: The framework advances CS education by providing scalable, explainable KC discovery for granular code patterns and constructs.

Abstract: Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on
accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While
Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC
extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient
explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems
with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex
interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel,
explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:
recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific
programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward
this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative
patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code
representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern
implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form
pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods
informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge
Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning
trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over
traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education
by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying
granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the generalization of dataset distillation across tasks, particularly transforming reinforcement learning into supervised learning.

Method: Uses a novel extension of proximal policy optimization for meta-learning to distill RL environments into one-batch supervised datasets.

Result: Successfully distills complex RL environments (e.g., MuJoCo, Atari games) into one-step supervised learning tasks, showing generalizability across architectures.

Conclusion: Dataset distillation effectively compresses and transforms RL tasks into supervised learning, enabling efficient and scalable learning.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic
dataset such that learning on the synthetic dataset approximates learning on
the original. Training on the distilled dataset can be performed in as little
as one step of gradient descent. We demonstrate that distillation is
generalizable to different tasks by distilling reinforcement learning
environments into one-batch supervised learning datasets. This demonstrates not
only distillation's ability to compress a reinforcement learning task but also
its ability to transform one learning modality (reinforcement learning) into
another (supervised learning). We present a novel extension of proximal policy
optimization for meta-learning and use it in distillation of a
multi-dimensional extension of the classic cart-pole problem, all MuJoCo
environments, and several Atari games. We demonstrate distillation's ability to
compress complex RL environments into one-step supervised learning, explore RL
distillation's generalizability across learner architectures, and demonstrate
distilling an environment into the smallest-possible synthetic dataset.

TL;DR: A decentralized weather forecasting framework using Federated Learning and blockchain improves accuracy, security, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing vulnerabilities and limitations of centralized forecasting systems, such as security risks and scalability issues.

Method: Integrates Federated Learning for privacy-preserving model training and blockchain for transparent verification, with IPFS for storage and a reputation-based voting mechanism.

Result: Improved forecasting accuracy, enhanced resilience, and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework is viable for real-world, security-critical environments.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture,
and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are
increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and
susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we
propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated
Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model
training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy
and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures
transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance
the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that
assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the
Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy
but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable
candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GNNev, an exact verification method for GNNs to ensure robustness against adversarial attacks involving attribute and structural perturbations, supporting sum, max, and mean aggregation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are used in critical applications but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing methods lack support for common aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs.

Method: The method uses constraint solving with bound tightening and iterative relaxation, implemented in GNNev, supporting sum, max, and mean aggregations.

Result: GNNev shows superior performance on node classification tasks across benchmarks (Cora, CiteSeer) and real-world fraud datasets (Amazon, Yelp).

Conclusion: GNNev is effective and versatile, providing exact verification for GNNs with broader aggregation support than existing tools.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to
adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide
adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation
functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop
an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute
guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge
addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node
classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound
tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint
satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of
solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for
message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions,
sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time.
Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and
CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its
usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to
existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biologically inspired synaptic pruning method for neural networks, replacing dropout with a dynamic, magnitude-based approach that progressively removes low-importance connections during training, improving performance in time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological synaptic pruning removes weak connections for efficiency, while dropout in neural networks randomly deactivates neurons. The paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a more biologically plausible pruning method.

Method: A magnitude-based synaptic pruning method is integrated into training, computing weight importance from absolute magnitudes and applying a cubic sparsity schedule. Pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow, eliminating separate pruning phases.

Result: Experiments on RNN, LSTM, and transformer models across four datasets showed consistent gains, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over standard dropout and up to 52% in select transformers.

Conclusion: The dynamic pruning method outperforms conventional dropout, offering easy integration and strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, making it a practical alternative.

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve
efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks
randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We
propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology
by progressively removing low-importance connections during training.
Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our
approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and
applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed
intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while
maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate
pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting
models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four
datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with
statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).
In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over
models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.
This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight
elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into
diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time
series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to
conventional dropout techniques.

Result: Preliminary results on S&P 500 data show improved robustness and interpretability under synthetic perturbations.

Conclusion: RicciFlowRec introduces geometric flow-based reasoning in financial recommendations, with potential for portfolio optimization and return forecasting.

Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs
root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial
graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic
indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature
and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal
substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary
results on S\&P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness
and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports
curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for
portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec
is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial
decision support.

### [225] [Resurrecting the Salmon: Rethinking Mechanistic Interpretability with Domain-Specific Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09363)
*Charles O'Neill,Mudith Jayasekara,Max Kirkby*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Domain-specific sparse autoencoders (SAEs) improve feature interpretability and reconstruction fidelity in large language models by focusing on well-defined domains like medical text, outperforming broad-domain SAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Broad-domain SAEs struggle with capturing domain-specific features, leading to fragmented or absorbed latents and high residual error. This work explores whether confining SAE training to a specific domain (medical text) can enhance feature quality and interpretability.

Method: The authors train JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2 models using 195k clinical QA examples, comparing performance to broad-domain SAEs.

Result: Domain-specific SAEs explain 20% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error. Features align with clinically meaningful concepts, leaving a smaller nonlinear residual.

Conclusion: Domain-confinement addresses limitations of broad-domain SAEs, yielding more interpretable and complete latent decompositions, and challenges the need for general-purpose SAEs in foundation models.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations
into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train
on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only
high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear
``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or
absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE
training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to
domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and
interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2
models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs
explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce
linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human
evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful
concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather
than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture
relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual.
We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain
SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and
suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for
general-purpose SAEs.

*Mansi,Anastasios Lepipas,Dominika Woszczyk,Yiying Guan,Soteris Demetriou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-to-image models can align dementia-related speech with generated images, achieving 75% accuracy in dementia detection from images alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if text-to-image models can align pathological speech (e.g., dementia) with generated images and explain this alignment.

Method: Examine alignment of dementia-related speech with generated images and develop explainability methods.

Result: Dementia detection from generated images achieved 75% accuracy on the ADReSS dataset.

Conclusion: Text-to-image models can detect dementia from speech-aligned images, with explainability methods revealing contributing language features.

Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural
language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images
online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and
generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand
whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated
images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align
dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop
methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia
detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the
ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of
the language contribute to the detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of data privacy and collaborative modeling in financial risk analysis across institutions.

Method: Uses federated learning with feature attention, temporal modeling, and differential privacy for secure parameter sharing.

Result: Outperforms centralized methods and other federated learning variants in accuracy, risk detection, and generalization.

Conclusion: Provides a secure, efficient solution for financial risk analysis while preserving data sovereignty.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative
modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk
assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the
method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple
institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism
and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed
optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The
model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection
before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to
generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk
identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple
experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model
accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods
and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It
demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive
financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk
identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and
efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed backend services using dynamic graphs and Transformers, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges like complex dependencies, diverse behavior evolution, and lack of labeled data in anomaly detection for distributed systems.

Method: Constructs dynamic graphs for structural dependencies, uses graph convolution and Transformers for temporal behavior, and integrates features via a joint embedding mechanism for anomaly scoring.

Result: Outperforms existing models in capturing anomaly propagation and dynamic behavior, showing high expressiveness and stability.

Conclusion: The method is effective for unsupervised anomaly detection in distributed systems, with strong practical deployment potential.

Abstract: This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed
backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex
structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of
labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation
relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural
representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the
temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local
fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding
mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified
anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores,
enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on
real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different
graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics,
demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly
propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential
for practical deployment.

*Xiaoyu Li,Guangyu Tang,Jiaojiao Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IHGNN introduces an implicit equilibrium formulation for hypergraphs, enabling stable and efficient global propagation without deep architectures, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of fixed-layer hypergraph neural networks in capturing long-range dependencies and stabilizing training.

Method: Uses a nonlinear fixed-point equation for representation computation, with a well-posed training scheme and implicit-gradient training.

Result: Outperforms traditional graph/hypergraph neural networks in accuracy and robustness, with resilience to initialization and hyperparameter variation.

Conclusion: IHGNN offers strong generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as
papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items.
Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order
relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing
layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as
depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks
(IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs:
instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a
nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global
propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a
well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing
conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive
generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient
training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy.
Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently
outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in
both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random
initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong
generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

*Siddharth Srikanth,John Krumm,Jonathan Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEXICA is a novel algorithm for identifying highway segments causing traffic slowdowns, using event-based time series analysis and probabilistic modeling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing road traffic congestion by identifying root causes of slowdowns to optimize resource allocation.

Method: Uses time series of road speeds, focusing on event presence/absence, probabilistic modeling, and a binary classifier trained on known cause/effect pairs.

Result: Tested on Los Angeles highway data, NEXICA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: NEXICA effectively identifies causal slowdown relationships, offering a superior tool for traffic management.

Abstract: Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the
causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing
slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the
highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use
time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding
other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three
ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the
time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic
slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood
estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns
between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to
identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations
where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both
positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data
from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that
our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
computation speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the complementary potential of contrastive and generative SSL for multivariate time series, addressing their individual limitations.

Method: Proposes CoGenT, a framework combining contrastive and generative optimization to enhance discriminative power and generative robustness.

Result: Achieves up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over SimCLR and MAE, respectively, on six datasets.

Conclusion: CoGenT establishes a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains, balancing discriminative and generative strengths.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes
two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and
generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective
individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a
Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to
unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT
addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive
learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while
reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT
on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements,
with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE,
respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves
discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings
establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the
code shortly.

TL;DR: A novel open-set fault diagnosis model (FGCRN) is proposed to classify known health states and identify unknown faults in multimode processes, using advanced feature extraction and unsupervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of constructing compact decision boundaries for health states with multiple cluster distributions in multimode processes.

Method: Combines multiscale depthwise convolution, bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and temporal attention for feature extraction. Uses a distance-based loss for intra-class compactness and unsupervised learning for fine-grained feature representation. Employs extreme value theory for unknown fault identification.

Result: The proposed FGCRN model demonstrates superior performance in experiments.

Conclusion: FGCRN effectively handles known and unknown fault diagnosis in multimode processes, offering a robust solution.

Abstract: A reliable fault diagnosis system should not only accurately classify known
health states but also effectively identify unknown faults. In multimode
processes, samples belonging to the same health state often show multiple
cluster distributions, making it difficult to construct compact and accurate
decision boundaries for that state. To address this challenge, a novel open-set
fault diagnosis model named fine-grained clustering and rejection network
(FGCRN) is proposed. It combines multiscale depthwise convolution,
bidirectional gated recurrent unit and temporal attention mechanism to capture
discriminative features. A distance-based loss function is designed to enhance
the intra-class compactness. Fine-grained feature representations are
constructed through unsupervised learning to uncover the intrinsic structures
of each health state. Extreme value theory is employed to model the distance
between sample features and their corresponding fine-grained representations,
enabling effective identification of unknown faults. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Meta-NAS methods suffer from poor generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: GraB-NAS models architectures as graphs and uses a hybrid search strategy: global search via Bayesian Optimization and local exploration via gradient ascent in latent space.

Result: GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines, achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Conclusion: GraB-NAS is a promising solution for task-aware architecture discovery, extending beyond predefined search spaces.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the design of high-performing
neural networks but typically targets a single predefined task, thereby
restricting its real-world applicability. To address this, Meta Neural
Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that
leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones.
Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor
generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this
paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS
first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy
is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural
architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via
Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel
neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search
strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong
performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines,
achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuronTune is a fine-grained framework for optimizing safety and utility in LLMs by dynamically modulating sparse neurons, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for safety alignment in LLMs lack robustness against attacks, refuse benign queries, and degrade performance, necessitating a better solution.

Method: NeuronTune identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons via attribution and uses meta-learning to adjust their activations dynamically.

Result: NeuronTune achieves superior safety and maintains excellent utility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NeuronTune provides a flexible, effective solution for simultaneous safety-utility optimization in LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the
reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient
robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries,
degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former
two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility
impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise
interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a
fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve
simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via
attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron
activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune
enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds,
supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority
scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving
superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

Result: The model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse IoT datasets, even with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: DeepFeatIoT advances IoT analytics and supports next-gen smart systems by enhancing data classification.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across
smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously
generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in
industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor
metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies,
inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time
series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart
systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model,
DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with
non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from
large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse
learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor
data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's
effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized
performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse
critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models.
These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant
advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation

Result: EGGS-PTP achieves significant acceleration, memory savings, and outperforms existing pruning methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: EGGS-PTP is an effective solution for deploying efficient LLMs without compromising performance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more widely adopted and scale up in
size, the computational and memory challenges involved in deploying these
massive foundation models have grown increasingly severe. This underscores the
urgent need to develop more efficient model variants. Faced with this
challenge, the present work introduces EGGS-PTP: an Expander-Graph Guided
Structured Post-training Pruning method. The proposed approach leverages graph
theory to guide the design of N:M structured pruning, effectively reducing
model size and computational demands. By incorporating concepts from expander
graphs, EGGS-PTP ensures information flow within the pruned network, preserving
essential model functionality. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that
EGGS-PTP not only achieves significant acceleration and memory savings due to
structured sparsity but also outperforms existing structured pruning techniques
in terms of accuracy across various LLMs.

TL;DR: A framework for Federated Continual Learning (FCL) bridges small models and Foundation Models (FMs) to enhance task adaptation and knowledge retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of FMs underperforming on local tasks due to inability to use private data and their tendency to forget prior knowledge.

Method: Proposes a collaborative framework with lightweight local models, Small Model Continual Fine-tuning, and One-by-One Distillation for knowledge fusion.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated, even with heterogeneous small models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges small models and FMs, improving continual learning in federated settings.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet
underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL),
where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data
and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities,
FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are
unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new
tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem,
primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In
contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained
conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap
between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in
FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually
adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel
components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for
preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation
performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients
utilize heterogeneous small models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPQ algorithms lack flexibility and efficiency, and there's no end-to-end framework for optimizing and deploying MPQ models.

Result: The framework achieves high accuracy with minimal drops while meeting latency constraints and provides end-to-end speedup.

Conclusion: MiCo offers a comprehensive solution for MPQ exploration and deployment, improving efficiency and accuracy for edge AI applications.

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) with extremely low-bitwidth data have proven
promising in efficient storage and computation on edge devices. To further
reduce the accuracy drop while increasing speedup, layer-wise mixed-precision
quantization (MPQ) becomes a popular solution. However, existing algorithms for
exploring MPQ schemes are limited in flexibility and efficiency. Comprehending
the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and
quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods.
Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ
models is missing in existing work.
  In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and
deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel
optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the
highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency
models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.
After the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ
models to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal

*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Haoyue Bai,Dongjie Wang,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAD is a Causal Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework for cyberattack detection in critical infrastructures, outperforming traditional methods by leveraging causal invariant graph structures and structural divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of cyberattacks on critical infrastructures necessitates robust anomaly detection methods that address system vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns, which traditional methods fail to handle effectively.

Method: CGAD uses a two-phase supervised framework: (1) learning causal invariant graph structures via Dynamic Bayesian Networks, and (2) detecting anomalies by comparing topological deviations in causal graphs over time.

Result: CGAD achieves higher precision, adaptability, and accuracy in non-stationary and imbalanced environments, with significant improvements in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over baselines.

Conclusion: CGAD redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving resilient to imbalance and drift, and effectively detects complex cyberattacks in critical infrastructures.

Abstract: With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical
infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for
robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system
vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods --
statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution
shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high
false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal
Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack
detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised
framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal
invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal"
and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs
structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by
evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging
causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in
non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional
machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile
sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher
precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving
resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our
framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over
best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust
detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.

Method: Integrates replay-based techniques with a Gaussian mixture model for better sample selection and adds instructional guidance for past learning generation.

Result: Shows a 6% improvement in retention metrics compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Gauss-Tin is effective for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, highlighting hybrid models' potential for robust LLMs in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs),
catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose
previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning
(CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with
replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving
learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach
that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance
the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional
guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to
improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important
past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results
indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional
methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating
catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid
models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning
environments.

*Fang Wang,Ernesto Damiani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified GNN framework for PBPM, addressing performance gaps, introducing a time decay attention mechanism, and embedding transition semantics for better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based PBPM models are underdeveloped, lacking in temporal relevance and transition semantics, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: The framework compares prefix-based GCNs and full trace GATs, introduces a time decay attention mechanism, and embeds transition semantics into edge features.

Result: The proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores on five benchmarks without per-dataset tuning.

Conclusion: The work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM by addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps.

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future events
in ongoing cases based on historical event logs. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data,
existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short
prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and
transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that
advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare
prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention
Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global
modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that
constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally
relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type
semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally
ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability
modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on
five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL
scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and
semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable
solution for next event prediction in PBPM.

*Bokeng Zheng,Jianqiang Zhong,Jiayi Liu,Xiaoxi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework for IoV systems using LoRA and a novel UCB-DUAL algorithm improves efficiency and accuracy under dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like client mobility, resource heterogeneity, and intermittent connectivity in IoV systems for efficient multi-task adaptation.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical framework with decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation (LoRA) and UCB-DUAL algorithm for adaptive exploration.

Result: Reduces latency by 24% and improves accuracy by 2.5% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in dynamic IoV scenarios.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting
foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency
multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility,
heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a
hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units
(RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning
across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we
introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as
a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is
developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets,
achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a
large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic
participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency
trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving
average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

TL;DR: SYNAPSE-G uses LLMs to generate synthetic data for rare event classification, then propagates labels semi-supervisedly on a similarity graph, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity, especially for rare events, limits ML model training. SYNAPSE-G tackles this cold-start problem.

Method: Generates synthetic data via LLMs, constructs a similarity graph for semi-supervised label propagation, and refines labels with an oracle.

Result: Outperforms baselines like nearest neighbor search on SST2 and MHS datasets.

Conclusion: SYNAPSE-G effectively addresses rare event classification by leveraging synthetic data and label propagation.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data, especially for rare events, hinders training
effective machine learning models. This paper proposes SYNAPSE-G (Synthetic
Augmentation for Positive Sampling via Expansion on Graphs), a novel pipeline
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data for
rare event classification, addressing the cold-start problem. This synthetic
data serve as seeds for semi-supervised label propagation on a similarity graph
constructed between the seeds and a large unlabeled dataset. This identifies
candidate positive examples, subsequently labeled by an oracle (human or LLM).
The expanded dataset then trains/fine-tunes a classifier. We theoretically
analyze how the quality (validity and diversity) of the synthetic data impacts
the precision and recall of our method. Experiments on the imbalanced SST2 and
MHS datasets demonstrate SYNAPSE-G's effectiveness in finding positive labels,
outperforming baselines including nearest neighbor search.

*Changyuan Zhao,Guangyuan Liu,Ruichen Zhang,Yinqiu Liu,Jiacheng Wang,Jiawen Kang,Dusit Niyato,Zan Li,Xuemin,Shen,Zhu Han,Sumei Sun,Chau Yuen,Dong In Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Edge General Intelligence (EGI) and the role of world models in enabling autonomous, proactive agents at the edge, covering applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in integrating world models into wireless edge computing for EGI, enhancing autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments.

Method: Analyzes architectural foundations of world models (latent representation, dynamics modeling, imagination-based planning) and their proactive applications in EGI scenarios like vehicular networks and IoT.

Result: Highlights how world models can optimize decisions under constraints (latency, energy, privacy) and synergize with foundation models and digital twins.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges (safety, training, deployment) and provides a roadmap for advancing intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge
computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,
and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this
vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not
only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under
uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature
allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of
real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have
showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless
edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a
comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural
foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics
modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,
we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of
Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby
highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and
privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and
digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.
Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient
training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.
This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for
realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

*Licheng Liu,Mingda Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prediction with Limited Selectivity (PLS), a model where forecasters can only predict on a subset of the time horizon, and analyzes optimal prediction error both instance-by-instance and on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where forecasters cannot predict at any time, unlike existing selective prediction models, and to understand the impact of limited selectivity on prediction error.

Method: Introduces PLS, studies optimal prediction error through instance-dependent bounds and average-case analysis, and proposes a complexity measure for instance-dependent error bounds.

Result: Bounds on optimal error are derived, and for randomly-generated PLS instances, these bounds match with high probability.

Conclusion: PLS provides a framework for understanding prediction under limited selectivity, with practical implications for forecasting in constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Selective prediction [Dru13, QV19] models the scenario where a forecaster
freely decides on the prediction window that their forecast spans. Many data
statistics can be predicted to a non-trivial error rate without any
distributional assumptions or expert advice, yet these results rely on that the
forecaster may predict at any time. We introduce a model of Prediction with
Limited Selectivity (PLS) where the forecaster can start the prediction only on
a subset of the time horizon. We study the optimal prediction error both on an
instance-by-instance basis and via an average-case analysis. We introduce a
complexity measure that gives instance-dependent bounds on the optimal error.
For a randomly-generated PLS instance, these bounds match with high
probability.

*Yan Yu,Yaodong Yang,Zhengbo Lu,Chengdong Ma,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GDCC, a framework for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by measuring causality (causal capacity) and identifying critical points as subgoals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing agent exploration by leveraging causality between actions and state transitions, addressing the challenge of measuring causality in complex environments.

Method: Derives causal capacity to measure influence on future trajectories, uses Monte Carlo for critical point identification, and optimizes for continuous spaces.

Result: States with high causal capacity align with subgoals, and GDCC improves success rates in multi-objective tasks.

Conclusion: GDCC effectively guides exploration by identifying critical points, demonstrating superior performance over baselines.

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be
modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in
reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the
causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason
how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed
exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its
intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework
for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a
measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which
represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories.
After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points
in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous
high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where
the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded
as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and
efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that
states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC
achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately
remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for
problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a
Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator
($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and
time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently
developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits
the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a
simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the
proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for
enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent
problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that
combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired
stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the
physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed
approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and
complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent
and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed
neural operator algorithms in the literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeMKG integrates variable semantics and numerical observations in time series modeling using knowledge graphs and large language models, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models ignore semantic information in variable names, missing critical domain knowledge for robust and interpretable modeling.

Method: TimeMKG uses large language models to interpret semantics, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs a dual-modality encoder with cross-modality attention.

Result: Incorporating variable-level knowledge enhances predictive performance and generalization across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: TimeMKG bridges the gap between low-level signal processing and knowledge-informed inference, offering interpretable and effective modeling.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities:
variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series
models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich
semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However,
these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is
essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a
multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from
low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs
large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured
Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A
dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from
knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time
series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the
variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as
forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to
guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that
incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive
performance and generalization.

*Johannes F. Hevler,Shivam Verma,Mirat Soijtra,Carolyn R. Bertozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thermal Tracks is a Python framework using Gaussian Process models to analyze protein thermal stability data, overcoming limitations of traditional TPP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TPP methods assume sigmoidal melting curves and rely on empirical null distributions, limiting significant hits. Thermal Tracks addresses these constraints for broader applicability.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model melting curves and generate unbiased null distributions via kernel priors.

Result: Enables analysis of proteome-wide perturbations and unconventional melting profiles (e.g., phase-separating or membrane proteins), often missed by standard TPP.

Conclusion: Thermal Tracks provides a flexible, accessible tool for proteome-wide thermal profiling, available on GitHub.

Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein
thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal
proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume
sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions
(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses
Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model
any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through
kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing
proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,
such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,
where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to
their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing
proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating
proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal
thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and
is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for
proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores asymmetric low-rank matrix completion via gradient descent without regularization, proving linear convergence and implicit regularization properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether regularization is necessary for convergence in gradient descent methods for matrix completion.

Method: Uses vanilla gradient descent with spectral initialization and analyzes convergence via the leave-one-out technique.

Result: Shows linear convergence without regularization and reveals implicit regularization in gradient descent.

Conclusion: The method is computationally efficient and performs comparably to regularized approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem,
which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem
with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient
descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate
regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence.
However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow
both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient
descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By
introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla
gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence
rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing
regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the
implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show
that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable
completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical framework for temporal anchoring in embedding spaces, ensuring convergence and robustness, and to analyze attention layers in neural networks.

Method: Uses drift maps, event-indexed blocks, and affine projections, with proofs for contraction and convergence theorems. Formalizes a Manuscript Computer and analyzes softmax Lipschitz properties in attention layers.

Result: Proves variable-block contraction, drift-projection convergence, and ontological convergence. Shows softmax is 1/2-Lipschitz and derives layer-contraction conditions.

Conclusion: The framework is robust and mathematically rigorous, with applications in embedding spaces and neural network attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in
embedding spaces, modeled as drift maps interleaved with event-indexed blocks
culminating in affine projections. We provide complete proofs for a
variable-block contraction lemma (products of Lipschitz factors), a
drift--projection convergence theorem with explicit uniform-gap envelopes, and
ontological convergence under nested affine anchors with a robustness variant.
We formalize an internal Manuscript Computer (MC) whose computations are
defined purely by these operators and prove a rigorous finite-run equivalence
theorem (with perturbation bounds). For attention layers, we give a
self-contained proof that softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz in $\ell_2$ and derive
sufficient layer-contraction conditions (orthogonal/non-orthogonal heads). All
floats are placed exactly where written; the manuscript uses only in-paper
pseudocode and appendix figures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for MLPs and KANs to improve robustness against noisy labels by adaptively masking less important edges during training. It outperforms SOTA methods and explores KANs' superior noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy labels degrade model performance, and existing solutions focus on robust loss functions and sample selection, neglecting regularization in model architecture.

Method: Introduces DCM to mask less important edges dynamically during training, reducing gradient error. Integrates with noise-robust methods like robust loss functions and sample selection.

Result: DCM consistently outperforms SOTA methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks. KANs show superior noise robustness compared to MLPs.

Conclusion: DCM enhances robustness against noisy labels and can be integrated with existing methods. KANs are promising for noisy label scenarios.

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong
capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy
labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on
mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust
loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of
regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization
used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection
Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and
KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The
mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by
evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis,
we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more
robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection
strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the
first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their
superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code
will soon be publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTG is a subtree-centric generative framework for efficient and accurate connectome synthesis, addressing limitations of current graph generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph generative models for connectomes have limitations like blurred local motifs, reliance on unavailable node attributes, poor edge-weight prediction, and high computational costs.

Method: GTG decomposes connectomes into entropy-guided k-hop trees, encodes them with a shared GCN, and uses a bipartite message-passing layer and dual-branch decoder for reconstruction.

Result: GTG outperforms baselines in self-supervised tasks, achieves higher structural fidelity, and uses less memory.

Conclusion: GTG offers an efficient, scalable solution for connectome synthesis with potential extensions for super-resolution and cross-modality synthesis.

Abstract: Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial
for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire,
motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling
offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and
reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models
face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code
(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node
attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;
(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight
prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive
designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,
limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric
generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG
decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing
informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite
message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while
a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to
reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings,
delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less
memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution
and cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to enhance CBMs by generating additional concepts from clinical notes, improving performance and interpretability in disease classification tasks like ARDS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large clinical datasets lack labels and interpretability. CBMs help but struggle when concepts don't fully explain tasks.

Method: Leverage LLMs to process clinical notes and generate supplementary concepts for CBMs.

Result: 10% performance gain over existing methods, with more comprehensive concepts and reduced spurious shortcuts.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information from notes improves CBM performance and interpretability for complex tasks like ARDS.

Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource
for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of
therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for
research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical
labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these
datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often
suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain
predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable
concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human
evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when
the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the
identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging
test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from
clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large
Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional
concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods.
Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts,
thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious
shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenCO is a novel framework for optimizing creative combinations in e-commerce ads by combining generative modeling and multi-instance reward learning, significantly boosting ad revenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods evaluate creative elements individually, missing the complexity of combinations, which limits ad effectiveness.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) generative model for diverse combinations, optimized via reinforcement learning, and (2) multi-instance learning to attribute rewards to individual elements.

Result: Deployed on a leading e-commerce platform, GenCO increased advertising revenue.

Conclusion: GenCO effectively navigates the creative combination space and improves ad performance, with a released dataset for further research.

Abstract: In e-commerce advertising, selecting the most compelling combination of
creative elements -- such as titles, images, and highlights -- is critical for
capturing user attention and driving conversions. However, existing methods
often evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the
exponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative
modeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage
architecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse
set of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with
reinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine
its selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a
multi-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as
clicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to
provide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative
model toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading
e-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising
revenue, demonstrating its practical value. Additionally, we are releasing a
large-scale industrial dataset to facilitate further research in this important
domain.

Motivation: To address the trade-off between model performance and deployability by enhancing small models through structured knowledge inheritance.

Method: HKT uses a biologically inspired framework (Extraction, Transfer, Mixture) and Genetic Attention for selective feature transfer from parent to child models.

Result: HKT improves performance across vision tasks (optical flow, classification, segmentation) while maintaining model compactness.

Conclusion: HKT offers a scalable, interpretable solution for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: A prevailing trend in neural network research suggests that model performance

small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured
knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a
biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of
task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller
child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform
imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance
mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage
process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional
carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated
components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention
(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,
ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision
tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),
and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves
child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that
HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a
general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying
high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

### [258] [A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Biological Age and its Longitudinal Drivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09747)
*Nazira Dunbayeva,Yulong Li,Yutong Xie,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning pipeline was developed to predict aging trajectories using longitudinal biomarker data, outperforming static models by incorporating dynamic rate-of-change features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of static models in capturing the dynamic nature of aging, aiming to improve predictive accuracy for biological age.

Method: Used a longitudinal cohort with data from two time periods, engineered slope features for biomarker changes, and trained a LightGBM model.

Result: Achieved high accuracy (R² = 0.515 for males, 0.498 for females), outperforming linear and other tree-based models. SHAP analysis highlighted slope features as key predictors.

Conclusion: Dynamic tracking of health trajectories improves biological age prediction, enabling personalized prevention strategies for age-related diseases.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's aging trajectory is a central challenge in
preventative medicine and bioinformatics. While machine learning models can
predict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the
dynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed
and validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal
cohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We
demonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has
limited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by
engineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)
of key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our
final LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully
predicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for
males, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional
linear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful
model revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important
predictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their
static health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age. Our framework
paves the way for clinical tools that dynamically track patient health
trajectories, enabling early intervention and personalized prevention
strategies for age-related diseases.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest and adoption of LLMs, with
$\mu$Transfer becoming a key technique for tuning hyperparameters in
large-scale training. Meanwhile, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a
leading architecture in extremely large models. However, the intersection of
these two advancements has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive a
$\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) for MoE, providing theoretical guarantees for
feature learning across model widths in both the router and experts. We
empirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TriForecaster, a framework for Multi-Region Electric Load Forecasting (MRELF), addressing regional, contextual, and temporal variations using Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). It reduces forecast error by 22.4% and is deployed in eastern China.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of smart grids and meters has enabled detailed load data, revealing similar load patterns across cities in eastern China, motivating the need for accurate multi-region short-term load forecasting.

Method: Proposes TriForecaster, featuring RegionMixer and CTSpecializer layers, leveraging MoE within MTL to handle regional, contextual, and temporal variations dynamically.

Result: TriForecaster reduces average forecast error by 22.4% on four real-world datasets and is successfully deployed for city-level forecasts in eastern China.

Conclusion: TriForecaster demonstrates flexibility and practical utility, effectively supporting large-scale, multi-region electric load forecasting.

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and
decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed
and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus
and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a
province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric
Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load
forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three
challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and
temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework
leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer
and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic
cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual,
and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets
with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by
achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating
its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of
TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its
practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts
for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily
electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.

TL;DR: Proto-PINV+H combines closed-form weight computation with gradient-based optimization of synthetic inputs, soft labels, and hidden activations, achieving high accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST quickly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift trainable degrees of freedom from weight space to data/activation space for faster and more efficient training.

Method: Uses ridge-regularized pseudo-inverse solves for weight computation and updates prototypes with Adam. Includes multi-layer extensions, learnable ridge parameters, and optional PCA/PLS projections.

Result: Achieves 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s with 130k parameters.

Conclusion: The method offers favorable accuracy-speed-size trade-offs compared to ELM, random-feature ridge, and shallow MLPs.

Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form
weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic
inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we
recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more)
ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes
with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space
to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k
train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the
official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k
trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a
multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable
ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the
condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields
favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge,
and shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the optimization of hyperparameters in Gaussian processes, particularly for Matérn kernel temporal models, by proposing a more efficient and accurate method.

Method: The procedure casts the optimization problem as a recursive Bayesian estimation for parameters of an autoregressive model.

Result: The proposed method outperforms marginal likelihood maximization and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in runtime and root mean square error.

Conclusion: Recursive Bayesian estimation is a superior approach for optimizing hyperparameters in Gaussian processes with Matérn kernels.

Abstract: Gaussian processes are important models in the field of probabilistic
numerics. We present a procedure for optimizing Mat\'ern kernel temporal
Gaussian processes with respect to the kernel covariance function's
hyperparameters. It is based on casting the optimization problem as a recursive
Bayesian estimation procedure for the parameters of an autoregressive model. We
demonstrate that the proposed procedure outperforms maximizing the marginal
likelihood as well as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, both in terms of
runtime and ultimate root mean square error in Gaussian process regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning to analyze biomechanical features in long jump performances, identifying key factors like knee angle for males and landing pose for females, alongside velocity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional physics-based methods struggle to analyze complex biomechanical relationships in sports. Machine learning offers a data-driven alternative to identify key performance features.

Method: Quantile regression models biomechanical features against jump distance, with SHAP, PDPs, and ICE plots for interpretation.

Result: Key findings: knee angle (>169°) for males, landing pose and approach technique for females, alongside velocity, are critical for top 10% performance.

Conclusion: The study provides a data-driven framework to analyze biomechanical features, emphasizing elite performance insights.

Abstract: Biomechanical features have become important indicators for evaluating
athletes' techniques. Traditionally, experts propose significant features and
evaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human
body and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the
relationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With
advancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods
have gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we
leverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical
features from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.
The objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features
contributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of
these key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship
between the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective
distance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the
model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial
Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The
findings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,
specific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the
angle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key
factor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater
than 169{\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for
female athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the
most critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity.
This study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features
on athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for in-context learning (ICL) in LLMs, explaining how transformers perform factual-recall tasks via vector arithmetic and demonstrating strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical insights into ICL and the role of latent task vectors, a theoretical explanation for factual-recall capabilities in LLMs is lacking.

Method: The authors develop an optimization theory for nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent, proving 0-1 loss convergence and generalization.

Result: The framework shows transformers' robustness to concept recombination and distribution shifts, outperforming static embedding methods.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical clarity on transformers' advantages in ICL, supported by empirical simulations.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability
to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the
presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al.
(2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for
Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks.
Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of
Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these
insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward,
we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded
hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how
nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy
loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss
convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept
recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages
of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations
corroborate our theoretical insights.

TL;DR: RankList, a listwise preference learning framework, improves global ranking consistency by modeling local and non-local constraints, outperforming baselines in SER and image aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of pairwise frameworks like RankNet, which struggle with global ranking consistency in subjective tasks like SER and image aesthetics.

Method: Proposes RankList, a probabilistic listwise framework with log-sum-exp approximation and skip-wise comparisons for better training and global ranking fidelity.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy on SER datasets (MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast) and aesthetic image ranking.

Conclusion: RankList offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences, improving in-domain ranking and cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: Preference learning has gained significant attention in tasks involving
subjective human judgments, such as \emph{speech emotion recognition} (SER) and
image aesthetic assessment. While pairwise frameworks such as RankNet offer
robust modeling of relative preferences, they are inherently limited to local
comparisons and struggle to capture global ranking consistency. To address
these limitations, we propose RankList, a novel listwise preference learning
framework that generalizes RankNet to structured list-level supervision. Our
formulation explicitly models local and non-local ranking constraints within a
probabilistic framework. The paper introduces a log-sum-exp approximation to
improve training efficiency. We further extend RankList with skip-wise
comparisons, enabling progressive exposure to complex list structures and
enhancing global ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method across diverse modalities. On benchmark SER datasets
(MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast), RankList achieves consistent improvements
in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy compared to standard listwise baselines.
We also validate our approach on aesthetic image ranking using the Artistic
Image Aesthetics dataset, highlighting its broad applicability. Through
ablation and cross-domain studies, we show that RankList not only improves
in-domain ranking but also generalizes better across datasets. Our framework
offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences in
subjective learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedShard is a federated unlearning algorithm ensuring efficiency and performance fairness, addressing dilemmas in convergence, unlearning efficiency, and fairness. It introduces novel fairness metrics and outperforms existing methods in speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated unlearning methods lack focus on fairness among clients during unlearning, risking issues like cascaded leaving and poisoning attacks.

Method: FedShard adaptively balances convergence, unlearning efficiency, and fairness, with new metrics to assess fairness.

Result: FedShard speeds up unlearning 1.3-6.2x faster than retraining and 4.9x faster than state-of-the-art methods, ensuring balanced costs and mitigating unfairness risks.

Conclusion: FedShard effectively addresses fairness and efficiency in federated unlearning, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated
unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the
global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing
unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency
fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning
have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the
first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both
efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the
challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and
unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to
quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to
satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in
terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that
FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning
attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental
results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2
times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the
state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

TL;DR: Proposes a data-efficient distillation framework (DED) for improving reasoning in LLMs without extensive scaling, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal curated examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs and inefficiencies in scaling reasoning capabilities of LLMs by optimizing distillation methods.

Method: Uses a threefold approach: selecting optimal teacher models, curating a smaller balanced corpus, and leveraging diverse reasoning trajectories.

Result: Achieves top performance on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks with only 0.8k examples.

Conclusion: DED provides a practical, efficient solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs while maintaining general capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in
tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent
methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training
combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some
methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via
only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing
computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation
framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.
Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of
reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We
identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher
model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop
a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can
enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully
curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and
out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the
student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method
through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and
code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only
0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our
systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by
considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model
capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced
reasoning while preserving general capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) outperform classical machine learning methods in predicting soil properties at field-scale, with TabPFN emerging as the top performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the dominance of classical machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest, Partial Least Squares Regression) in field-scale predictive soil modeling (PSM) by evaluating modern ANN architectures.

Method: A benchmark study comparing state-of-the-art ANN architectures (e.g., MLP-based models, transformers, retrieval-augmented approaches) against classical methods on 31 field- and farm-scale datasets.

Result: Modern ANNs consistently outperform classical methods, with TabPFN showing the strongest overall performance and robustness.

Conclusion: Modern ANNs, particularly TabPFN, should replace classical methods as the default choice for field-scale PSM.

Abstract: In the field of pedometrics, tabular machine learning is the predominant
method for predicting soil properties from remote and proximal soil sensing
data, forming a central component of digital soil mapping. At the field-scale,
this predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small
training sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy.
Traditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep
learning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly
tree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least
Squares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM.
Recent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge
this view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN
architectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models
(TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer,
ExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR,
ModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our
evaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460
samples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic
carbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently
outperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep
learning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of
classical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest
overall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions. We therefore
recommend the adoption of modern ANNs for field-scale PSM and propose TabPFN as
the new default choice in the toolkit of every pedometrician.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored question of when anomalies can be conclusively detected in a dataset.

Method: Conducted over three million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and algorithms to derive a relationship between dataset size, contamination rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant.

Result: Found that the condition $N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2}$ is a lower bound for confirming anomaly existence, highlighting limits for rare anomalies.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical threshold for anomaly detection feasibility, emphasizing the interplay between dataset size and anomaly rarity.

Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for
effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in
anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that
addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that
anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three
million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and
algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination
rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results
demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate
$ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents
a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence.
This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving
their existence becomes infeasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of LLMs in context-aided forecasting by addressing limitations of naive direct prompting.

Method: Four strategies: ReDP (explicit reasoning traces), CorDP (refining forecasts with context), IC-DP (embedding historical examples), RouteDP (task difficulty-based routing).

Result: Demonstrated distinct benefits over naive prompting across LLMs of varying sizes and families on the CiK benchmark.

Conclusion: The strategies offer simple yet effective improvements for LLM-based context-aided forecasting, paving the way for further advancements.

Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only
historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in
textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can
be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full
potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,
providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.
ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing
us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its
forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts
with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting
pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided
forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the
largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to
estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger
models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from
the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive
prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the
door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided
forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), an efficient alternative to retrieval-augmented diffusion models, using dynamic visual prototypes for semantic conditioning without external memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models are computationally intensive, and retrieval-based methods introduce storage and adaptability issues. PDM aims to address these drawbacks.

Method: PDM integrates prototype learning into diffusion, constructing dynamic visual prototypes from clean image features via contrastive learning to guide denoising.

Result: PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage costs, outperforming retrieval-based methods.

Conclusion: PDM offers a scalable and efficient solution for semantic conditioning in diffusion models, eliminating the need for external memory.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image
generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse
domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during
the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion
alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though
at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as
Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning
denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While
effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and
retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for
similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype
Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly
into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -
without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM
constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features
using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by
aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,
enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show
that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and
storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based
conditioning in diffusion models.

Motivation: To enhance long-term propagation of input in Reservoir Computing (RC) by introducing residual connections in a novel RNN architecture.

Method: ResRMN integrates a linear memory reservoir with a non-linear reservoir using residual orthogonal connections. Stability analysis and diverse configurations are explored.

Result: Empirical tests on time-series and 1-D classification tasks show ResRMN outperforms conventional RC models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

reservoir, where the latter is based on residual orthogonal connections along
the temporal dimension for enhanced long-term propagation of the input. The
resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear
stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal
residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on
time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over other conventional RC
models.

*Luca Eyring,Shyamgopal Karthik,Alexey Dosovitskiy,Nataniel Ruiz,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Noise Hypernetwork to replace reward-guided test-time noise optimization in diffusion models, reducing computational overhead while preserving quality gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves model performance but increases computation time, making it impractical for many applications. The goal is to retain benefits while minimizing overhead.

Method: Introduces a Noise Hypernetwork to modulate initial input noise, using a tractable noise-space objective to optimize for desired characteristics without excessive computation.

Result: The approach recovers significant quality gains from test-time optimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates test-time scaling knowledge into models post-training, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in
Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision
models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to
effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of
this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in
computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.
Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve
its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose
one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge
into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided
test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that
modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework
for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through
a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model
while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach
recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time
optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. Code is available at

### [274] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Incremental Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09974)
*Lecheng Kong,Theodore Vasiloudis,Seongjun Yun,Han Xie,Xiang Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for graph incremental learning to address catastrophic forgetting and improve adaptability to new data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph machine learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning, and prior approaches fail to account for varying contributions of old knowledge to new tasks.

Method: The DyMoE approach adds new expert networks for incoming data blocks, uses a customized regularization loss, and employs a sparse MoE to reduce computational costs.

Result: The model achieved a 4.92% relative accuracy increase over baselines in class incremental learning.

Conclusion: DyMoE effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and improves incremental learning performance while managing computational costs.

Abstract: Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained
models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need
for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning
methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental
learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new
knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the
previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to
maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,
do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different
timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns
can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the
new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic
mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a
DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming
data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data
sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve
old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the
number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a
sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make
predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved
4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class
incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: CoDe introduces a data-driven approach using covering design and tensor decomposition for cardinality estimation, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for cardinality estimation either lack accuracy or are slow. CoDe aims to balance both speed and precision.

Method: CoDe divides tables into overlapping segments, models each with tensor decomposition, and combines distributions for query results.

Result: CoDe achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, with absolute accuracy in over half of the queries tested.

Conclusion: CoDe significantly advances cardinality estimation by effectively balancing accuracy and computational speed.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database management systems,
aiming to predict query results accurately without executing the queries.
However, existing techniques either achieve low estimation accuracy or incur
high inference latency. Simultaneously achieving high speed and accuracy
becomes critical for the cardinality estimation problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel data-driven approach called CoDe (Covering with Decompositions)
to address this problem. CoDe employs the concept of covering design, which
divides the table into multiple smaller, overlapping segments. For each
segment, CoDe utilizes tensor decomposition to accurately model its data
distribution. Moreover, CoDe introduces innovative algorithms to select the
best-fitting distributions for each query, combining them to estimate the final
result. By employing multiple models to approximate distributions, CoDe excels
in effectively modeling discrete distributions and ensuring computational
efficiency. Notably, experimental results show that our method represents a
significant advancement in cardinality estimation, achieving state-of-the-art
levels of both estimation accuracy and inference efficiency. Across various
datasets, CoDe achieves absolute accuracy in estimating more than half of the
queries.

*Yuchen Tian,Kaixin Li,Hao Chen,Ziyang Luo,Hongzhan Lin,Sebastian Schelter,Lun Du,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with ambiguous graph queries, prompting a new benchmark (AmbiGraph-Eval) and taxonomy for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graph queries often contain ambiguities, leading to incorrect results, highlighting a gap in LLM capabilities.

Method: Proposed a taxonomy of graph-query ambiguities (Attribute, Relationship, Attribute-Relationship) and introduced AmbiGraph-Eval benchmark.

Result: Evaluation of 9 LLMs showed poor performance on ambiguous queries, revealing a critical gap.

Conclusion: Specialized resolution techniques are needed to improve LLMs' handling of ambiguous graph queries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in translating natural language into database queries, especially when dealing
with complex graph-structured data. However, real-world queries often contain
inherent ambiguities, and the interconnected nature of graph structures can
amplify these challenges, leading to unintended or incorrect query results. To
systematically evaluate LLMs on this front, we propose a taxonomy of
graph-query ambiguities, comprising three primary types: Attribute Ambiguity,
Relationship Ambiguity, and Attribute-Relationship Ambiguity, each subdivided
into Same-Entity and Cross-Entity scenarios. We introduce AmbiGraph-Eval, a
novel benchmark of real-world ambiguous queries paired with expert-verified
graph query answers. Evaluating 9 representative LLMs shows that even top
models struggle with ambiguous graph queries. Our findings reveal a critical
gap in ambiguity handling and motivate future work on specialized resolution
techniques.

TL;DR: The paper uses evolutionary game theory to study feedback loops between users and AI classifiers, focusing on strategic adaptation in credit lending. It explores interventions like gaming detection and algorithmic recourse to mitigate adverse effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the collective dynamics resulting from users adapting to AI classifiers and institutions retraining algorithms, particularly in high-stakes areas like finance.

Method: Applies evolutionary game theory to model interactions between users and institutions, testing scenarios like gaming detection and algorithmic recourse.

Result: Improved detection reduces social costs and fosters user improvement; algorithmic recourse helps when perfect classifiers are unfeasible. Speed of institutional adaptation affects outcomes.

Conclusion: Strategic adaptation and retraining create complex dynamics; interventions like recourse and detection can mitigate adverse effects, but cycling dynamics may emerge.

Abstract: Classification algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are nowadays
applied in high-stakes decisions in finance, healthcare, criminal justice, or
education. Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered
about classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which
collective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms'
retraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our
framework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of
feedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test
interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a
case study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending.
We consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction
paradigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we
are able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic
classification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the
institutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm
(e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role
of improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that
increased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users'
improvement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in
practice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users'
improvement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's
population plays a role in the final outcome. Finally, we explore a scenario
where strict institutions provide actionable recourse to their unsuccessful
users and observe cycling dynamics so far unnoticed in the literature.

TL;DR: The paper explores generating discrete genotype data using deep generative models (VAEs, Diffusion Models, GANs), addressing challenges in simulating realistic genomic data while preserving privacy and genetic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in simulating discrete genotype data and improve accessibility while maintaining privacy.

Method: Developed and evaluated VAEs, Diffusion Models, and GANs, adapting them for discrete genotype data. Experiments were conducted on cow and human datasets.

Result: Models effectively captured genetic patterns and preserved genotype-phenotype associations.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive comparison of models and practical guidelines for future genotype simulation research.

Abstract: Deep generative models open new avenues for simulating realistic genomic data
while preserving privacy and addressing data accessibility constraints. While
previous studies have primarily focused on generating gene expression or
haplotype data, this study explores generating genotype data in both
unconditioned and phenotype-conditioned settings, which is inherently more
challenging due to the discrete nature of genotype data. In this work, we
developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We
conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all
chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human. Model performance was
assessed using a well-established set of metrics drawn from both deep learning
and quantitative genetics literature. Our results show that these models can
effectively capture genetic patterns and preserve genotype-phenotype
association. Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of these models
and offer practical guidelines for future research in genotype simulation. We

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'safe-completions' as an alternative to binary refusal boundaries in LLMs, focusing on output safety rather than intent classification, improving safety and helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary refusal boundaries in LLMs like ChatGPT can be brittle for ambiguous or dual-use prompts, leading to safety or usability issues.

Method: Introduces 'safe-completions,' a training approach prioritizing output safety over binary intent classification, implemented in GPT-5.

Result: Safe-completion training enhances safety (especially for dual-use prompts), reduces severity of failures, and increases model helpfulness.

Conclusion: Safe-completions offer a more effective and balanced approach to LLM safety training compared to binary refusal boundaries.

Abstract: Large Language Models used in ChatGPT have traditionally been trained to
learn a refusal boundary: depending on the user's intent, the model is taught
to either fully comply or outright refuse. While this is a strong mitigation
for explicitly malicious prompts, focusing safety training on refusals can lead
to brittleness for prompts with obscured user intent. Binary refusal boundaries
are especially ill-suited for dual-use cases (such as biology or
cybersecurity), where a user request can be answered safely at a high level,
but in some cases can lead to malicious uplift if sufficiently detailed or
actionable. As an alternative, we propose safe-completions: a safety-training
approach that centers on the safety of the assistant's output, rather than a
binary classification of the user's intent. Safe-completions seek to maximize
helpfulness within the safety policy's constraints. We incorporated this
approach into GPT-5 and find that across both production comparisons and
internally controlled experiments, safe-completion training improves safety
(especially on dual-use prompts), reduces the severity of residual safety
failures, and substantially increases model helpfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the context-dependent nature of generating meaningful explanations in XAI, ensuring accessibility and transparency.

Method: Proposes a three-part framework (Who, What, How) for explanation design, drawing on design thinking and ethical considerations.

Result: Encourages a context-aware, sociotechnical approach to XAI for effective and ethically responsible explanations.

Conclusion: Explanation in XAI should be treated as a design process, integrating context-awareness and ethical responsibility.

Abstract: The field of Explainable AI (XAI) offers a wide range of techniques for
making complex models interpretable. Yet, in practice, generating meaningful
explanations is a context-dependent task that requires intentional design
choices to ensure accessibility and transparency. This paper reframes
explanation as a situated design process -- an approach particularly relevant
for practitioners involved in building and deploying explainable systems.
Drawing on prior research and principles from design thinking, we propose a
three-part framework for explanation design in XAI: asking Who needs the
explanation, What they need explained, and How that explanation should be
delivered. We also emphasize the need for ethical considerations, including
risks of epistemic inequality, reinforcing social inequities, and obscuring
accountability and governance. By treating explanation as a sociotechnical
design process, this framework encourages a context-aware approach to XAI that
supports effective communication and the development of ethically responsible
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure ethical research and development of MISyn, preventing negative impacts like misinformation and discrimination.

Method: Theoretical analysis of MISyn's ethical properties and limits, followed by practical recommendations and case studies.

Result: Identified risks include lack of grounding in real phenomena and biases; proposed ethical practice and oversight recommendations.

Conclusion: Ethical MISyn requires acknowledging limits, adapting practices, and involving stakeholders to mitigate harms and build trust.

Abstract: The task of ethical Medical Image Synthesis (MISyn) is to ensure that the
MISyn techniques are researched and developed ethically throughout their entire
lifecycle, which is essential to prevent the negative impacts of MISyn. To
address the ever-increasing needs and requirements for ethical practice of
MISyn research and development, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that
identifies the key properties of ethical MISyn and intrinsic limits of MISyn.
We identify that synthetic images lack inherent grounding in real medical
phenomena, cannot fully represent the training medical images, and inevitably
introduce new distribution shifts and biases.
  Ethical risks can arise from not acknowledging the intrinsic limits and
weaknesses of synthetic images compared to medical images, with the extreme
form manifested as misinformation of MISyn that substitutes synthetic images
for medical images without acknowledgment. The resulting ethical harms include
eroding trust in the medical imaging dataset environment and causing
algorithmic discrimination towards stakeholders and the public.
  To facilitate collective efforts towards ethical MISyn within and outside the
medical image analysis community, we then propose practical supports for
ethical practice in MISyn based on the theoretical analysis, including ethical
practice recommendations that adapt the existing technical standards, problem
formulation, design, and evaluation practice of MISyn to the ethical
challenges; and oversight recommendations to facilitate checks and balances
from stakeholders and the public. We also present two case studies that
demonstrate how to apply the ethical practice recommendations in practice, and
identify gaps between existing practice and the ethical practice
recommendations.

Conclusion: STREAM aims to standardize transparent reporting of AI evaluations, fostering trust and better decision-making in AI development.

Abstract: Evaluations of dangerous AI capabilities are important for managing
catastrophic risks. Public transparency into these evaluations - including what
they test, how they are conducted, and how their results inform decisions - is
crucial for building trust in AI development. We propose STREAM (A Standard for
Transparently Reporting Evaluations in AI Model Reports), a standard to improve
how model reports disclose evaluation results, initially focusing on chemical
and biological (ChemBio) benchmarks. Developed in consultation with 23 experts
across government, civil society, academia, and frontier AI companies, this
standard is designed to (1) be a practical resource to help AI developers
present evaluation results more clearly, and (2) help third parties identify
whether model reports provide sufficient detail to assess the rigor of the
ChemBio evaluations. We concretely demonstrate our proposed best practices with
"gold standard" examples, and also provide a three-page reporting template to
enable AI developers to implement our recommendations more easily.

Conclusion: Fake-Mamba demonstrates strong generalization, practical viability, and real-time performance, offering a competitive solution for synthetic speech detection.

Abstract: Advances in speech synthesis intensify security threats, motivating real-time

TL;DR: A text-to-prosody model (ProMode) improves F0 and energy prediction, enhancing TTS prosody.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture and model prosodic features (e.g., F0, energy) for better speech synthesis.

Method: ProMode encodes masked acoustic and text inputs into prosodic embeddings, predicting masked regions.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in F0/energy prediction; perceptual tests favor its TTS integration.

Conclusion: ProMode effectively models prosody, benefiting tasks like TTS.

Abstract: Prosody conveys rich emotional and semantic information of the speech signal
as well as individual idiosyncrasies. We propose a stand-alone model that maps
text-to-prosodic features such as F0 and energy and can be used in downstream
tasks such as TTS. The ProMode encoder takes as input acoustic features and
time-aligned textual content, both are partially masked, and obtains a
fixed-length latent prosodic embedding. The decoder predicts acoustics in the
masked region using both the encoded prosody input and unmasked textual
content. Trained on the GigaSpeech dataset, we compare our method with
state-of-the-art style encoders. For F0 and energy predictions, we show
consistent improvements for our model at different levels of granularity. We
also integrate these predicted prosodic features into a TTS system and conduct
perceptual tests, which show higher prosody preference compared to the
baselines, demonstrating the model's potential in tasks where prosody modeling
is important.

TL;DR: The paper explores hierarchical multi-objective optimization (MOO) for multilingual, multi-task speech processing (MSP) to address conflicting objectives, proposing a bi-level recipe that outperforms flat optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting objectives in MSP tasks like speech recognition and translation hinder joint optimization, raising the question of whether to optimize jointly or hierarchically.

Method: Three multi-objective MSP formulations (objective soup recipes) are investigated, with a lightweight layer-selection mechanism to compute conflict-avoiding gradients efficiently.

Result: A bi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks outperforms flat optimization, as shown in experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1.

Conclusion: Hierarchical MOO is more effective and scalable for state-of-the-art MSP models, with code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Training a single model for multilingual, multi-task speech processing (MSP)
is severely hampered by conflicting objectives between tasks like speech
recognition and translation. While multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to
align gradient updates, its effectiveness diminishes as the number of tasks
grows, making it difficult to find a common descent direction. This raises a
fundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly
or separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this
paper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as
\textbf{objective soup recipes}. These formulations apply multi-objective
optimization at different optimization levels to mitigate potential conflicts
among all objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
layer-selection mechanism that computes the conflict-avoiding gradient using
only the most problematic layers, minimizing computational and memory overhead.
Extensive experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1 reveal that a
bi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks consistently
outperforms standard flat optimization. Our work demonstrates that hierarchical
MOO is a more effective and scalable approach for building state-of-the-art MSP
models. Our code has been released at

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper addresses overestimation of privacy in speaker anonymization by proposing a target classifier to measure and mitigate target speaker influence, improving evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy evaluations for speaker anonymization overestimate privacy when same-gender target selection is used, leaking speaker gender.

Method: Proposes adding a target classifier to evaluate and remove target speaker influence via adversarial learning.

Result: Experiments show the approach improves evaluation reliability, especially with same-gender target selection.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances privacy assessment accuracy in speaker anonymization.

Abstract: The current privacy evaluation for speaker anonymization often overestimates
privacy when a same-gender target selection algorithm (TSA) is used, although
this TSA leaks the speaker's gender and should hence be more vulnerable. We
hypothesize that this occurs because the evaluation does not account for the
fact that anonymized speech contains information from both the source and
target speakers. To address this, we propose to add a target classifier that
measures the influence of target speaker information in the evaluation, which
can also be removed with adversarial learning. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach is effective for multiple anonymizers, particularly when using a
same-gender TSA, leading to a more reliable assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore semantic cataloging and LLMs for retrieving and recontextualizing archival TV content, inspired by Italian TV programs.

Method: Integrates ASR, semantic embeddings, and RAG to transcribe, segment, and embed TV footage into a vector database for semantic querying and narrative generation.

Result: Produces montages with thematic coherence and ironic juxtaposition, demonstrating dynamic retrieval and automated narrative construction.

Conclusion: AI Blob! advances semantic archival engagement, offering a framework and dataset for media historiography and AI-driven research.

Abstract: This paper introduces AI Blob!, an experimental system designed to explore
the potential of semantic cataloging and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the
retrieval and recontextualization of archival television footage. Drawing
methodological inspiration from Italian television programs such as Blob (RAI
Tre, 1989-), AI Blob! integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), semantic
embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to organize and
reinterpret archival content. The system processes a curated dataset of 1,547
Italian television videos by transcribing audio, segmenting it into
sentence-level units, and embedding these segments into a vector database for
semantic querying. Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a
range of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval
and recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically
selected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that
emulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By

TL;DR: PETLP is a compliance framework integrating GDPR, copyright, and platform terms for social media research, embedding legal safeguards into ETL pipelines and treating impact assessments as evolving documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks fail to unify regulatory domains (GDPR, copyright, platform terms), leaving researchers without clear guidance for compliance.

Method: Introduces PETLP, embedding legal safeguards into extended ETL pipelines and using evolving Data Protection Impact Assessments. Demonstrates through Reddit analysis.

Result: Highlights differing extraction rights for research vs. commercial entities, unachievable anonymisation, and legal gaps in dataset creation vs. model distribution.

Conclusion: PETLP bridges legal requirements and research practice, simplifying compliance and data management for researchers.

Abstract: Social media data presents AI researchers with overlapping obligations under
the GDPR, copyright law, and platform terms -- yet existing frameworks fail to
integrate these regulatory domains, leaving researchers without unified
guidance. We introduce PETLP (Privacy-by-design Extract, Transform, Load, and
Present), a compliance framework that embeds legal safeguards directly into
extended ETL pipelines. Central to PETLP is treating Data Protection Impact
Assessments as living documents that evolve from pre-registration through
dissemination. Through systematic Reddit analysis, we demonstrate how
extraction rights fundamentally differ between qualifying research
organisations (who can invoke DSM Article 3 to override platform restrictions)
and commercial entities (bound by terms of service), whilst GDPR obligations
apply universally. We reveal why true anonymisation remains unachievable for
social media data and expose the legal gap between permitted dataset creation
and uncertain model distribution. By structuring compliance decisions into
practical workflows and simplifying institutional data management plans, PETLP
enables researchers to navigate regulatory complexity with confidence, bridging
the gap between legal requirements and research practice.

TL;DR: RT-HAD is a deep learning framework for real-time analysis of blood cell aggregates using digital holographic microscopy, addressing data storage and processing challenges in clinical diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare blood cell aggregates are hard to analyze automatically but hold diagnostic potential. Current methods like flow cytometry miss aggregates, and imaging techniques face data hurdles.

Method: RT-HAD combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction with deep learning, representing cells as graphs for aggregate detection, processing >30 GB data in <1.5 min.

Result: Achieves 8.9% error rate in platelet aggregate detection, matching clinical standards, and enables real-time point-of-care diagnostics.

Conclusion: RT-HAD solves big data challenges and improves diagnostics by integrating hidden biomarkers into routine haematology panels without manual reviews.

Abstract: While analysing rare blood cell aggregates remains challenging in automated
haematology, they could markedly advance label-free functional diagnostics.
Conventional flow cytometers efficiently perform cell counting with leukocyte
differentials but fail to identify aggregates with flagged results, requiring
manual reviews. Quantitative phase imaging flow cytometry captures detailed
aggregate morphologies, but clinical use is hampered by massive data storage
and offline processing. Incorporating hidden biomarkers into routine
haematology panels would significantly improve diagnostics without flagged
results. We present RT-HAD, an end-to-end deep learning-based image and data
processing framework for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM), which
combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction and detection,
representing each blood cell in a graph to recognize aggregates. RT-HAD
processes >30 GB of image data on-the-fly with turnaround time of <1.5 min and
error rate of 8.9% in platelet aggregate detection, which matches acceptable
laboratory error rates of haematology biomarkers and solves the big data
challenge for point-of-care diagnostics.

*Gaojie Zhou,Junhua Li*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: A lightweight, unified deep learning model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification achieves high accuracy and outperforms existing models, enabling low-cost, universal BCI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BCI models are paradigm-specific, requiring costly redevelopment. A lightweight, unified model is needed for practical and portable use.

Method: The model uses tempo-spatial convolution, multi-scale local feature selection, and multi-dimensional global feature extraction to create high-level representations.

Result: Achieves 88.39% accuracy, 82.36% macro-precision, 80.01% macro-recall, and 0.8092 macro-F1-score, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: The model provides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classification, paving the way for universal, low-cost BCI applications.

Abstract: Classification models used in brain-computer interface (BCI) are usually
designed for a single BCI paradigm. This requires the redevelopment of the
model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and
effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical
usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the
above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding
model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a
tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature
selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms
and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature
extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are
extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to
form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The
results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI,
SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%,
80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and
macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models.
This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm
classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new
generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and
universal practical applications.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Machine learning models for odor prediction improve using expert and data-driven taxonomies, outperforming random groupings. Both taxonomies enhance predictions and are shared for community use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of odor space and complex structure-odor relationships challenge odor prediction from molecular structure.

Method: Use of expert (semantic/perceptual) and data-driven (clustering co-occurrence) taxonomies to improve ML model predictions.

Result: Both taxonomies enhance predictive performance across odor classes, with data-driven taxonomy validating expert taxonomy.

Conclusion: Shared taxonomies and dataset support community-driven exploration of molecular odor space, with expert taxonomy expanded to 777 descriptors.

Abstract: One of the key challenges to predict odor from molecular structure is
unarguably our limited understanding of the odor space and the complexity of
the underlying structure-odor relationships. Here, we show that the predictive
performance of machine learning models for structure-based odor predictions can
be improved using both, an expert and a data-driven odor taxonomy. The expert
taxonomy is based on semantic and perceptual similarities, while the
data-driven taxonomy is based on clustering co-occurrence patterns of odor
descriptors directly from the prepared dataset. Both taxonomies improve the
predictions of different machine learning models and outperform random
groupings of descriptors that do not reflect existing relations between odor
descriptors. We assess the quality of both taxonomies through their predictive
performance across different odor classes and perform an in-depth error
analysis highlighting the complexity of odor-structure relationships and
identifying potential inconsistencies within the taxonomies by showcasing pear
odorants used in perfumery. The data-driven taxonomy allows us to critically
evaluate our expert taxonomy and better understand the molecular odor space.
Both taxonomies as well as a full dataset are made available to the community,
providing a stepping stone for a future community-driven exploration of the
molecular basis of smell. In addition, we provide a detailed multi-layer expert
taxonomy including a total of 777 different descriptors from the Pyrfume
repository.

TL;DR: A novel framework for learning individual cortical growth trajectories improves biological plausibility and interpretability of brain development mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current normative modelling frameworks fail to capture fine-scale anatomical details due to reliance on population-average references, limiting their utility for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.

Method: The framework uses biomechanically constrained, longitudinal, diffeomorphic image registration via a hierarchical network architecture, trained on neonatal MRI data.

Result: The method produces smoother warps with fewer negative Jacobians, better following population-level trends and improving biological plausibility.

Conclusion: This framework enables predictive modeling of brain maturation and early identification of cortical malformations, offering new insights into neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Understanding individual cortical development is essential for identifying
deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. However, current normative
modelling frameworks struggle to capture fine-scale anatomical details due to
their reliance on modelling data within a population-average reference space.
Here, we present a novel framework for learning individual growth trajectories
from biomechanically constrained, longitudinal, diffeomorphic image
registration, implemented via a hierarchical network architecture. Trained on
neonatal MRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, the method
improves the biological plausibility of warps, generating growth trajectories
that better follow population-level trends while generating smoother warps,
with fewer negative Jacobians, relative to state-of-the-art baselines. The
resulting subject-specific deformations provide interpretable, biologically
grounded mappings of development. This framework opens new possibilities for
predictive modeling of brain maturation and early identification of
malformations of cortical development.

*Peigen Ye,Jingpu Duan,Hongyang Du,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A user-intention-driven semantic communication system is proposed, leveraging a multi-modal large model and mask-guided attention to improve intent understanding and transmission efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication systems lack deep understanding and generalization of user intentions.

Method: Integrates a multi-modal large model for intent prior generation, uses mask-guided attention for semantic highlighting, and includes a channel state awareness module for adaptive transmission.

Result: Outperforms DeepJSCC with improvements of 8% (PSNR), 6% (SSIM), and 19% (LPIPS) at 5 dB SNR in Rayleigh channels.

Conclusion: The system achieves deep intent understanding and robust performance across varying channel conditions.

Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on transmitting task-relevant semantic
information, aiming for intent-oriented communication. While existing systems
improve efficiency by extracting key semantics, they still fail to deeply
understand and generalize users' real intentions. To overcome this, we propose
a user-intention-driven semantic communication system that interprets diverse
abstract intents. First, we integrate a multi-modal large model as semantic
knowledge base to generate user-intention prior. Next, a mask-guided attention
module is proposed to effectively highlight critical semantic regions. Further,
a channel state awareness module ensures adaptive, robust transmission across
varying channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system
achieves deep intent understanding and outperforms DeepJSCC, e.g., under a
Rayleigh channel at an SNR of 5 dB, it achieves improvements of 8%, 6%, and 19%
in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized product search ranking by leveraging mixed data types and advanced embedding techniques in a multi-task learning setup.

Method: Combines tabular and non-tabular data using TinyBERT for semantic embeddings, introduces a novel sampling technique, and proposes a scalable relevance labeling mechanism based on click data.

Result: The model outperforms baselines, showing significant performance gains from combining non-tabular data, fine-tuning TinyBERT, and using relevance labels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances personalized product search ranking, demonstrating the value of integrating diverse data types and advanced embeddings in MTL.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

TL;DR: NAPO is a new framework for LLM-based recommendation systems that improves negative sample utilization with in-batch sharing and dynamic reward margins, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle with inefficient use of negative samples, leading to computational overhead and suboptimal performance.

Method: NAPO introduces in-batch negative sharing to expand negative samples without extra memory and dynamic reward margin adjustment for adaptive optimization.

Result: NAPO achieves better recommendation accuracy and reduces popularity bias in experiments on three public datasets.

Conclusion: NAPO effectively addresses challenges in negative sample utilization for LLM-based recommenders, offering improved performance.

Abstract: Recommendation systems leverage user interaction data to suggest relevant
items while filtering out irrelevant (negative) ones. The rise of large
language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention for their potential in
recommendation tasks. However, existing methods for optimizing LLM-based
recommenders face challenges in effectively utilizing negative samples. Simply
integrating large numbers of negative samples can improve ranking accuracy and
mitigate popularity bias but often leads to increased computational overhead
and memory costs. Additionally, current approaches fail to account for the
varying informativeness of negative samples, leading to suboptimal optimization
performance. To address these issues, we propose NAPO
(\textbf{N}egative-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization),
an enhanced framework for preference optimization in LLM-based recommendation.
NAPO introduces two key innovations: (1) in-batch negative sharing, which
expands the pool of negative samples without additional memory overhead, and
(2) dynamic reward margin adjustment, which adapts model updates based on the
confidence of negative samples. Extensive experiments on three public datasets
demonstrate that NAPO outperforms existing methods in both recommendation
accuracy and popularity bias reduction.

*Marco De Nadai,Andreas Damianou,Mounia Lalmas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate rich natural-language descriptions of video clips improves recommendation systems by capturing high-level semantics like intent and humor, outperforming traditional low-level features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video recommender systems miss deeper semantics (e.g., intent, humor) in clips, which are critical for personalized recommendations.

Method: A zero-finetuning framework prompts an MLLM to summarize clips into rich descriptions, combined with a text encoder and fed into standard recommender models.

Result: The framework outperforms conventional features (video, audio, metadata) on the MicroLens-100K dataset across five models.

Conclusion: MLLMs can effectively extract high-level semantics to enhance intent-aware video recommendations.

Abstract: Existing video recommender systems rely primarily on user-defined metadata or
on low-level visual and acoustic signals extracted by specialised encoders.
These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper
semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate
with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or
an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such
distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible
to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple,
recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects
high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an
off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip
into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with
slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content
and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and
feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative
recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions
with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional
video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings
highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to
build more intent-aware video recommenders.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI/ML-driven Fault Analysis Engine for 5G networks to classify and resolve faults in PCAP files, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing 5G network faults are time-consuming and labor-intensive, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: The FA Engine uses NLP and ML to classify faults in PCAP files and suggests fixes via a trained LLM, referencing 3GPP standards.

Result: High classification accuracy was achieved on test datasets, demonstrating the engine's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The FA Engine is a promising tool for 5G fault analysis, with potential extensions to 4G and other network data types.

Abstract: With the advent of 5G networks and technologies, ensuring the integrity and
performance of packet core traffic is paramount. During network analysis, test
files such as Packet Capture (PCAP) files and log files will contain errors if
present in the system that must be resolved for better overall network
performance, such as connectivity strength and handover quality. Current
methods require numerous person-hours to sort out testing results and find the
faults. This paper presents a novel AI/ML-driven Fault Analysis (FA) Engine
designed to classify successful and faulty frames in PCAP files, specifically
within the 5G packet core. The FA engine analyses network traffic using natural
language processing techniques to identify anomalies and inefficiencies,
significantly reducing the effort time required and increasing efficiency. The
FA Engine also suggests steps to fix the issue using Generative AI via a Large
Language Model (LLM) trained on several 5G packet core documents. The engine
explains the details of the error from the domain perspective using documents
such as the 3GPP standards and user documents regarding the internal conditions
of the tests. Test results on the ML models show high classification accuracy
on the test dataset when trained with 80-20 splits for the successful and
failed PCAP files. Future scopes include extending the AI engine to incorporate
4G network traffic and other forms of network data, such as log text files and
multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rigidity and lack of business context in current network slice controllers by involving stakeholders directly in operations.

Method: Uses three AI branches (Legislative, Executive, Judicial) for compliance, situational awareness, and trust scoring, with negotiation agents and a multi-objective optimizer for Pareto-optimal offers.

Result: 37% throughput increase for eMBB slices, 73% latency reduction for URLLC slices, and 8.3% PRB usage saving. A fine-tuned Llama model achieves 80% of GPT-4.1's decision quality with low resource use.

Conclusion: Agoran provides a scalable, stakeholder-centric approach for flexible 6G networks, validated by testbed results.

Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks must reconcile the often-conflicting goals of
multiple service owners. However, today's network slice controllers remain
rigid, policy-bound, and unaware of the business context. We introduce Agoran
Service and Resource Broker (SRB), an agentic marketplace that brings
stakeholders directly into the operational loop. Inspired by the ancient Greek
agora, Agoran distributes authority across three autonomous AI branches: a
Legislative branch that answers compliance queries using retrieval-augmented
Large Language Models (LLMs); an Executive branch that maintains real-time
situational awareness through a watcher-updated vector database; and a Judicial
branch that evaluates each agent message with a rule-based Trust Score, while
arbitrating LLMs detect malicious behavior and apply real-time incentives to
restore trust. Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator
Agent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective
optimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then
deployed to Open and AI RAN controllers. Deployed on a private 5G testbed and
evaluated with realistic traces of vehicle mobility, Agoran achieved
significant gains: (i) a 37% increase in throughput of eMBB slices, (ii) a 73%
reduction in latency of URLLC slices, and concurrently (iii) an end-to-end 8.3%
saving in PRB usage compared to a static baseline. An 1B-parameter Llama model,
fine-tuned for five minutes on 100 GPT-4 dialogues, recovers approximately 80%
of GPT-4.1's decision quality, while operating within 6 GiB of memory and
converging in only 1.3 seconds. These results establish Agoran as a concrete,
standards-aligned path toward ultra-flexible, stakeholder-centric 6G networks.

Motivation: Current AI agents face inefficiencies in understanding web pages, making interactions slow and costly. webMCP aims to bridge this gap by enabling direct access to structured interaction data.

Method: webMCP embeds structured interaction metadata into web pages, allowing AI agents to bypass full HTML processing and use pre-structured data for tasks.

Result: Evaluations show 67.6% reduced processing, 97.9% task success, and cost reductions of 34-63%. Independent studies confirm practical applicability.

Conclusion: webMCP offers a deployable, efficient solution for AI web assistance without server-side changes, improving accessibility and sustainability.

Abstract: Current AI agents create significant barriers for users by requiring
extensive processing to understand web pages, making AI-assisted web
interaction slow and expensive. This paper introduces webMCP (Web Machine
Context & Procedure), a client-side standard that embeds structured interaction
metadata directly into web pages, enabling more efficient human-AI
collaboration on existing websites. webMCP transforms how AI agents understand
web interfaces by providing explicit mappings between page elements and user
actions. Instead of processing entire HTML documents, agents can access
pre-structured interaction data, dramatically reducing computational overhead
while maintaining task accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation across 1,890 real
API calls spanning online shopping, authentication, and content management
scenarios demonstrates webMCP reduces processing requirements by 67.6% while
maintaining 97.9% task success rates compared to 98.8% for traditional
approaches. Users experience significantly lower costs (34-63% reduction) and
faster response times across diverse web interactions. Statistical analysis
confirms these improvements are highly significant across multiple AI models.
An independent WordPress deployment study validates practical applicability,
showing consistent improvements across real-world content management workflows.
webMCP requires no server-side modifications, making it deployable across
millions of existing websites without technical barriers. These results
establish webMCP as a viable solution for making AI web assistance more
accessible and sustainable, addressing the critical gap between user
interaction needs and AI computational requirements in production environments.

TL;DR: HiSTM improves cellular traffic forecasting with a dual spatial encoder and Mamba-based temporal module, achieving 29.4% better MAE than STN with 94% fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cellular traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex spatial-temporal patterns from user mobility, and existing AI models often compromise between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: HiSTM combines a dual spatial encoder, Mamba-based temporal module, and attention mechanism using selective state space methods to capture spatial-temporal patterns.

Result: HiSTM outperforms baselines, showing a 29.4% MAE improvement over STN with 94% fewer parameters, and generalizes well across datasets.

Conclusion: HiSTM effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, improving forecasting performance and scalability for cellular traffic.

Abstract: Cellular traffic forecasting is essential for network planning, resource
allocation, or load-balancing traffic across cells. However, accurate
forecasting is difficult due to intricate spatial and temporal patterns that
exist due to the mobility of users. Existing AI-based traffic forecasting
models often trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency. We present
Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Mamba (HiSTM), which combines a dual spatial
encoder with a Mamba-based temporal module and attention mechanism. HiSTM
employs selective state space methods to capture spatial and temporal patterns
in network traffic. In our evaluation, we use a real-world dataset to compare
HiSTM against several baselines, showing a 29.4% MAE improvement over the STN
baseline while using 94% fewer parameters. We show that the HiSTM generalizes
well across different datasets and improves in accuracy over longer
time-horizons.

Interfaces (APIs), creating substantial operational complexities in service
discovery and management. We introduce \textit{NEFMind}, a framework leveraging
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to
address these challenges. It integrates three core components: synthetic
dataset generation from Network Exposure Function (NEF) API specifications,
model optimization through Quantized-Low-Rank Adaptation, and performance
evaluation via GPT-4 Ref Score and BertScore metrics. Targeting 5G
Service-Based Architecture APIs, our approach achieves 85% reduction in
communication overhead compared to manual discovery methods. Experimental
validation using the open-source Phi-2 model demonstrates exceptional API call
identification performance at 98-100% accuracy. The fine-tuned Phi-2 model
delivers performance comparable to significantly larger models like GPT-4 while
maintaining computational efficiency for telecommunications infrastructure
deployment. These findings validate domain-specific, parameter-efficient LLM
strategies for managing complex API ecosystems in next-generation
telecommunications networks.

Conclusion: MX-AI validates the practicality of AI-native RANs, with released resources to foster open research.

Abstract: Future 6G radio access networks (RANs) will be artificial intelligence
(AI)-native: observed, reasoned about, and re-configured by autonomous agents
cooperating across the cloud-edge continuum. We introduce MX-AI, the first
end-to-end agentic system that (i) instruments a live 5G Open RAN testbed based

realistic operational queries, MX-AI attains a mean answer quality of 4.1/5.0
and 100 % decision-action accuracy, while incurring only 8.8 seconds end-to-end
latency when backed by GPT-4.1. Thus, it matches human-expert performance,
validating its practicality in real settings. We publicly release the agent

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: CoMoE is a dynamic resource-aware framework optimizing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) deployment in mobile edge environments, reducing memory usage by 70% and latency by 10.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of deploying large MoE models in resource-constrained mobile edge environments due to high memory and dynamic activation.

Method: Proposes CoMoE, a framework optimizing expert aggregation and offloading strategies based on real-time resource states, network conditions, and input characteristics.

Result: Achieves 70% memory reduction, 10.5% lower latency, and enables deployment of large MoE models (e.g., 7.4B parameters) on edge devices.

Conclusion: CoMoE effectively balances performance and resource constraints, making MoE models feasible for mobile edge computing.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has driven the adoption of
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures as a promising solution to scale model
capacity while controlling computational costs. However, deploying MoE models
in resource-constrained mobile edge computing environments presents significant
challenges due to their large memory footprint and dynamic expert activation
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic
resource-aware collaborative optimization framework that jointly optimizes
expert aggregation granularity and offloading strategies based on real-time
device resource states, network conditions, and input characteristics in mobile
edge environments, denoted as CoMoE. In CoMoE, we first systematically analyze
existing expert aggregation techniques, including expert parameter
merging,knowledge distillation,and parameter sharing decomposition, identifying
their limitations in dynamic mobile environments.We then investigate expert
offloading strategies encompassing expert prediction and prefetching, expert
caching and scheduling, and multi-tier storage architectures, revealing the
interdependencies between routing decisions and offloading performance.The
CoMoE incorporates adaptive scheduling mechanisms that respond to user mobility
and varying network conditions, enabling efficient MoE deployment across
heterogeneous edge devices. Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds
demonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage
compared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing
expert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability.
For large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE
reduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on
resource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support
much smaller models.

*Danil Sivtsov,Aleksandr Katrutsa,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integer linear program (ILP) for efficient topology-aware placement of pre-trained MoE LLMs to minimize network traffic during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient deployment of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs in clusters is challenging due to imbalanced expert loads and the need for network-aware placement.

Method: An ILP-based model placement algorithm is introduced to optimize expert distribution, considering network topology and minimizing transmissions.

Result: The ILP strategy reduces network traffic for both small-scale (DeepSeekMoE~16B) and large-scale (DeepSeek-R1~671B) models compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed ILP approach effectively improves cluster utilization and reduces network overhead for deploying MoE LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of a pre-trained LLM to a cluster with multiple servers
is a critical step for providing fast responses to users' queries. The recent
success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy
them efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference
in MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given
token. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For
efficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of
servers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster
utilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network
topology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the
pre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear
program (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the
expected number of transmissions. Due to the internal structure, this
optimization problem can be solved with a standard ILP solver. We demonstrate
that ILP-based placement strategy yields lower network traffic than competitors
for small-scale (DeepSeekMoE~16B) and large-scale (DeepSeek-R1~671B) models.

TL;DR: ANCHOR is an unsupervised anomaly detection solution for IoT connectivity, designed to proactively identify and resolve issues before they critically impact service.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of IoT ecosystems makes it hard to guarantee communication reliability, and reactive approaches compromise service quality.

Method: The paper proposes statistical rules, machine learning, and deep learning models for anomaly detection using passive signaling traffic.

Result: ANCHOR successfully identifies problematic IoT clients, enabling proactive resolution.

Conclusion: ANCHOR improves IoT service reliability by shifting from reactive to proactive issue detection and resolution.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) application providers rely on Mobile Network
Operators (MNOs) and roaming infrastructures to deliver their services
globally. In this complex ecosystem, where the end-to-end communication path
traverses multiple entities, it has become increasingly challenging to
guarantee communication availability and reliability. Further, most platform
operators use a reactive approach to communication issues, responding to user
complaints only after incidents have become severe, compromising service
quality. This paper presents our experience in the design and deployment of
ANCHOR -- an unsupervised anomaly detection solution for the IoT connectivity
service of a large global roaming platform. ANCHOR assists engineers by
filtering vast amounts of data to identify potential problematic clients (i.e.,
those with connectivity issues affecting several of their IoT devices),
enabling proactive issue resolution before the service is critically impacted.
We first describe the IoT service, infrastructure, and network visibility of
the IoT connectivity provider we operate. Second, we describe the main
challenges and operational requirements for designing an unsupervised anomaly
detection solution on this platform. Following these guidelines, we propose
different statistical rules, and machine- and deep-learning models for IoT
verticals anomaly detection based on passive signaling traffic. We describe the
steps we followed working with the operational teams on the design and
evaluation of our solution on the operational platform, and report an
evaluation on operational IoT customers.

### [308] [QuickGrasp: Lightweight Antipodal Grasp Planning with Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19716)
*Navin Sriram Ravie,Keerthi Vasan M,Asokan Thondiyath,Bijo Sebastian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight analytical approach for robotic grasp planning, focusing on antipodal grasps without extensive sampling in 6-DOF space. It proposes an optimization-based method for grasp point estimation and evaluates it against GPD, showing effectiveness in simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional grasp planning methods suffer from poor generalization, inefficiency, and lack of repeatability in real-world settings, necessitating a more robust and efficient approach.

Method: The method formulates grasp planning as an optimization problem, using a soft-region-growing algorithm for plane segmentation and an optimization-based quality metric for grasp evaluation.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms GPD in simulations and real-world tests, demonstrating improved efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The lightweight analytical method offers a viable alternative to sampling-based approaches, addressing key limitations in grasp planning for real-world applications.

Abstract: Grasping has been a long-standing challenge in facilitating the final
interface between a robot and the environment. As environments and tasks become
complicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the
surroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods
utilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure
sampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning
problem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization
across domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the
lack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic
nature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application
in real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach
towards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to
no sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning
algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp
points on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector
pose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for
effective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An
optimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp
points to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is
compared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose
detection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated
in a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned
grasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator.

*Reema Raval,Shalabh Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SMART-OC is a novel algorithm for USVs to dynamically replan paths in marine environments, optimizing for time and risk by avoiding obstacles and leveraging ocean currents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine environments are complex with dynamic obstacles and currents, making safe and efficient navigation challenging for USVs.

Method: SMART-OC integrates obstacle risks and time costs to replan time-risk optimal paths in real-time.

Result: Simulation experiments show SMART-OC enables USVs to quickly replan paths, avoiding obstacles and utilizing currents to reach goals.

Conclusion: SMART-OC effectively addresses dynamic marine navigation challenges for USVs.

Abstract: Typical marine environments are highly complex with spatio-temporally varying
currents and dynamic obstacles, presenting significant challenges to Unmanned
Surface Vehicles (USVs) for safe and efficient navigation. Thus, the USVs need
to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid
collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting
ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called
Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents
(SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic
environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time
cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of
SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV
performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents
to successfully reach the goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cable routing is complex and challenging for robots, with risks of over-squeezing and over-tension using common grippers.

Method: Design of eagle-inspired fingernails for grippers, combined with vision-based state estimation and offline trajectory planning for continuous control.

Result: The framework outperforms pick-and-place methods, efficiently manipulating cables in 3D space.

Conclusion: The proposed fingernail design and framework offer a promising solution for future 3D cable routing tasks.

Abstract: The manipulation of deformable linear flexures has a wide range of
applications in industry, such as cable routing in automotive manufacturing and
textile production. Cable routing, as a complex multi-stage robot manipulation
scenario, is a challenging task for robot automation. Common parallel
two-finger grippers have the risk of over-squeezing and over-tension when
grasping and guiding cables. In this paper, a novel eagle-inspired fingernail
is designed and mounted on the gripper fingers, which helps with cable grasping
on planar surfaces and in-hand cable guiding operations. Then we present a
single-grasp end-to-end 3D cable routing framework utilizing the proposed
fingernails, instead of the common pick-and-place strategy. Continuous control
is achieved to efficiently manipulate cables through vision-based state
estimation of task configurations and offline trajectory planning based on
motion primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with
a variety of cables and channel slots, significantly outperforming the
pick-and-place manipulation process under equivalent perceptual conditions. Our
reconfigurable task setting and the proposed framework provide a reference for
future cable routing manipulations in 3D space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot control methods are rigid and require user adaptation, limiting usability in dynamic environments.

Method: Integrates LLMs with Behavior Trees to translate natural language into executable actions using domain-specific plugins.

Result: Achieved 94% cognition-to-execution accuracy in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The framework is practical for HRI, scalable, and modular, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there
is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional
robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize
predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments.
This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language
understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural
language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions
by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular
integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as
person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series
of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in
real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of
approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

*Haoxiang Shi,Xiang Deng,Zaijing Li,Gongwei Chen,Yaowei Wang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DifNav is an end-to-end VLN-CE policy unifying waypoint generation and planning into a single diffusion model, outperforming two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of two-stage VLN-CE frameworks, such as sub-optimization and reliance on waypoint quality.

Method: Uses a conditional diffusion policy for multi-modal action distributions and DAgger for robust training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage models in navigation performance.

Conclusion: DifNav offers a more efficient and robust solution for VLN-CE tasks by eliminating the need for waypoint predictors.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.
Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning
framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable
waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the
high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework
suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each
stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the
quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,
we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE
policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and
planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional
diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future
actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint
predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible
instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in
imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation
tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory
augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This
approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to
recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method
substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based
models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for training human-robot handover policies using RGB images and Gaussian Splatting, avoiding real-robot trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the visual domain gap in simulation training for human-robot handovers without real-robot data.

Method: Uses sparse-view Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct scenes and generate image-action pairs for policy training.

Result: Effective in simulated and real-world handover tasks, enabling stable grasping and collision avoidance.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust representation for seamless human-robot handovers, enhancing HRT systems.

Abstract: Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human
and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such
as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw,
real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the
physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective
alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace
remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies,
focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need
for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable
the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while
avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages
sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes
to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a
camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose
changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose
changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and
real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method
serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover
task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.

Motivation: The fragmentation in data processing and learning algorithms across robot morphologies hinders human-like humanoid robot development.

Method: GBC includes an adaptive data pipeline for motion retargeting, the DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with MMTransformer for policy learning, and an open-source platform based on Isaac Lab.

Result: GBC demonstrates excellent performance and transferability across multiple humanoids, validating its generality.

Conclusion: GBC provides the first practical, unified framework for generalized humanoid controllers.

Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental
fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal
across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized
Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed
to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from
human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an
adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically
retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our
novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,
high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire
framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac
Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple
configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training
policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent
performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first
practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid
controllers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper formalizes river following by UAVs as a Submodular Markov Decision Process, introduces Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation (MGAE), a Semantic Dynamics Model (SDM), and the Constrained Actor Dynamics Estimator (CADE) architecture for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous river following is crucial for rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring, especially in GPS-unreliable dense riverine environments.

Method: 1. MGAE refines reward advantage using a sliding window baseline. 2. SDM uses patchified water semantic masks for interpretable predictions. 3. CADE integrates actor, cost estimator, and SDM for safe RL.

Result: MGAE outperforms traditional methods in convergence and performance. SDM improves short-term predictions, and CADE ensures safety during training and inference.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances reward and safety, enhancing autonomous river following for UAVs.

Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is
critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental
monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are
unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which
the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique
river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov
Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which
refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline
computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage
estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in
non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on
patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and
data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent
vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics
Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM
for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of
solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.
Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and
superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized
Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions
that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,
CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the
Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during
training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard
action overlay.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A static analysis approach to identify bugs in distributed machine learning models by checking if sequential model outputs can be reconstructed from distributed outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed ML models can introduce bugs causing output discrepancies between sequential and distributed versions, necessitating a method to detect such issues.

Method: Uses iterative rewriting to prove model refinement, implemented in GraphGuard, and evaluates on GPT and Llama-3.

Result: Scalable to large models, provides actionable bug localization output.

Conclusion: GraphGuard effectively identifies and localizes bugs in distributed ML models by verifying refinement.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning training and inference is common today because
today's large models require more memory and compute than can be provided by a
single GPU. Distributed models are generally produced by programmers who take a
sequential model specification and apply several distribution strategies to
distribute state and computation across GPUs. Unfortunately, bugs can be
introduced in the process, and a distributed model implementation's outputs
might differ from the sequential model's outputs. In this paper, we describe an
approach to statically identify such bugs by checking model refinement, that
is, can the sequential model's outputs be reconstructed from the distributed
model's outputs? Our approach, implemented in GraphGuard, uses iterative
rewriting to prove model refinement. Our approach can scale to today's large
models and deployments: we evaluate it using GPT and Llama-3. Further, it
provides actionable output that aids in bug localization.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: HierMoE accelerates MoE transformer training by reducing communication traffic and balancing GPU workloads using token deduplication and expert swap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address communication and load imbalances in MoE models that hinder scalability in GPU clusters.

Method: Introduces token deduplication and expert swap, with theoretical models for optimal strategies. Implemented atop Megatron-LM.

Result: Achieves 1.55× to 3.32× faster communication and 1.18× to 1.27× faster training than state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: HierMoE effectively improves MoE model training efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: The sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer has become a
common architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to its sparsity, which
requires fewer computational demands while easily scaling the model size. In
MoE models, each MoE layer requires to dynamically choose tokens to activate
particular experts for computation while the activated experts may not be
located in the same device or GPU as the token. However, this leads to
substantial communication and load imbalances across all GPUs, which obstructs
the scalability of distributed systems within a GPU cluster. To this end, we
introduce HierMoE to accelerate the training of MoE models by two
topology-aware techniques: 1) token deduplication to reduce the communication
traffic, and 2) expert swap to balance the workloads among all GPUs. To enable
the above two proposed approaches to be more general, we build theoretical
models aimed at achieving the best token duplication and expert swap strategy
under different model configurations and hardware environments. We implement
our prototype HierMoE system atop Megatron-LM and conduct experiments on a
32-GPU cluster with DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-30B-A3B models. Experimental results
show that our HierMoE achieves $1.55\times$ to $3.32\times$ faster
communication and delivers $1.18\times$ to $1.27\times$ faster end-to-end
training compared to state-of-the-art MoE training systems, Tutel-2DH,
SmartMoE, and Megatron-LM.

### [318] [Teaching Code Refactoring Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09332)
*Anshul Khairnar,Aarya Rajoju,Edward F. Gehringer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs enhance code refactoring teaching by providing real-time, context-aware feedback in software engineering courses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching code refactoring is challenging, especially with complex codebases, and traditional methods offer limited feedback.

Method: Integrates LLM-assisted refactoring into a course project using structured prompts to address code smells.

Result: LLMs bridge theoretical and practical learning, improving understanding of maintainability and refactoring principles.

Conclusion: LLMs effectively support teaching refactoring by providing actionable feedback and enhancing student learning.

Abstract: This Innovative Practice full paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can enhance the teaching of code refactoring in software engineering courses
through real-time, context-aware feedback. Refactoring improves code quality
but is difficult to teach, especially with complex, real-world codebases.
Traditional methods like code reviews and static analysis tools offer limited,
inconsistent feedback. Our approach integrates LLM-assisted refactoring into a
course project using structured prompts to help students identify and address
code smells such as long methods and low cohesion. Implemented in Spring 2025
in a long-lived OSS project, the intervention is evaluated through student
feedback and planned analysis of code quality improvements. Findings suggest
that LLMs can bridge theoretical and practical learning, supporting a deeper
understanding of maintainability and refactoring principles.

### [319] [Your Coding Intent is Secretly in the Context and You Should Deliberately Infer It Before Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09537)
*Yanzhou Li,Tianlin Li,Yiran Zhang,Shangqing Liu,Aishan Liu,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a three-stage process to improve LLM performance in generating code functions without explicit annotations, using intent inference, interactive refinement, and conditioned generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly in real-world codebases where annotations like docstrings are missing, necessitating a method to infer intent from context.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: 1) intent inference from preceding code, 2) optional interactive refinement, and 3) function generation based on finalized intent.

Result: The approach improves LLM performance by over 20% in metrics, with interactive refinement adding further gains.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the gap in LLM performance for code generation in annotation-scarce environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for function completion in
repository-scale codebases. Prior studies demonstrate that when explicit
instructions--such as docstrings--are provided, these models can generate
highly accurate implementations. However, in real-world repositories, such
annotations are frequently absent, and performance drops substantially without
them. To address this gap, we frame the task as a three-stage process. The
first stage focuses on intent inference, where the model analyzes the code
preceding the target function to uncover cues about the desired functionality.
Such preceding context often encodes subtle but critical information, and we
design a reasoning-based prompting framework to guide the LLM through
step-by-step extraction and synthesis of these signals before any code is
generated. The second stage introduces an optional interactive refinement
mechanism to handle cases where preceding context alone is insufficient for
intent recovery. In this stage, the model proposes a small set of candidate
intentions, enabling the developer to select or edit them so that the inferred
intent closely matches the actual requirement. Finally, in the third stage, the
LLM generates the target function conditioned on the finalized intent. To
support this pipeline, we curate a dataset of 40,000 examples annotated with
intermediate reasoning traces and corresponding docstrings. Extensive
experiments on DevEval and ComplexCodeEval show that our approach consistently
boosts multiple LLMs, achieving over 20\% relative gains in both
reference-based and execution-based metrics, with the interactive refinement
stage delivering additional improvements beyond these gains.

### [320] [DeputyDev -- AI Powered Developer Assistant: Breaking the Code Review Logjam through Contextual AI to Boost Developer Productivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09676)
*Vishal Khare,Vijay Saini,Deepak Sharma,Anand Kumar,Ankit Rana,Anshul Yadav*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DeputyDev, an AI-powered code review assistant, significantly reduces PR review times and improves efficiency in software development workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review inefficiencies, such as long processing times and inconsistent feedback, hinder software development. DeputyDev aims to address these challenges.

Method: Developed an AI-powered tool for automated, contextual code reviews and conducted a double-controlled A/B experiment with over 200 engineers.

Result: Statistically significant reductions in average PR review time (23.09%) and per-line-of-code review time (40.13%). Successfully deployed organization-wide and as a SaaS solution.

Conclusion: AI-assisted code reviews, like DeputyDev, effectively improve development workflow timelines and code quality.

Abstract: This study investigates the implementation and efficacy of DeputyDev, an
AI-powered code review assistant developed to address inefficiencies in the
software development process. The process of code review is highly inefficient
for several reasons, such as it being a time-consuming process, inconsistent
feedback, and review quality not being at par most of the time. Using our
telemetry data, we observed that at TATA 1mg, pull request (PR) processing
exhibits significant inefficiencies, with average pick-up and review times of
73 and 82 hours, respectively, resulting in a 6.2 day closure cycle. The review
cycle was marked by prolonged iterative communication between the reviewing and
submitting parties. Research from the University of California, Irvine
indicates that interruptions can lead to an average of 23 minutes of lost
focus, critically affecting code quality and timely delivery. To address these
challenges, we developed DeputyDev's PR review capabilities by providing
automated, contextual code reviews. We conducted a rigorous double-controlled
A/B experiment involving over 200 engineers to evaluate DeputyDev's impact on
review times. The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in
both average per PR (23.09%) and average per-line-of-code (40.13%) review
durations. After implementing safeguards to exclude outliers, DeputyDev has
been effectively rolled out across the entire organisation. Additionally, it
has been made available to external companies as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
solution, currently supporting the daily work of numerous engineering
professionals. This study explores the implementation and effectiveness of
AI-assisted code reviews in improving development workflow timelines and code.

### [321] [LibRec: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Library Migration Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09791)
*Junxiao Han,Yarong Wang,Xiaodong Gu,Cuiyun Gao,Yao Wan,Song Han,David Lo,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LibRec integrates LLMs and RAG for library migration recommendations, using in-context learning for intent extraction. Evaluated via LibEval, it tests 10 LLMs, analyzes components, prompts, and intent types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating library migration recommendations by leveraging LLMs and RAG to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Combines LLMs with RAG, uses in-context learning for intent extraction, and evaluates with LibEval benchmark (2,888 migration records).

Result: Assessed 10 LLMs, performed ablation studies, tested prompt strategies, and analyzed intent types and failures.

Conclusion: LibRec effectively automates library recommendations, with detailed insights from LibEval evaluations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose LibRec, a novel framework that integrates the
capabilities of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) techniques to
automate the recommendation of alternative libraries. The framework further
employs in-context learning to extract migration intents from commit messages
to enhance the accuracy of its recommendations. To evaluate the effectiveness
of LibRec, we introduce LibEval, a benchmark designed to assess the performance
in the library migration recommendation task. LibEval comprises 2,888 migration
records associated with 2,368 libraries extracted from 2,324 Python
repositories. Each migration record captures source-target library pairs, along
with their corresponding migration intents and intent types. Based on LibEval,
we evaluated the effectiveness of ten popular LLMs within our framework,
conducted an ablation study to examine the contributions of key components
within our framework, explored the impact of various prompt strategies on the
framework's performance, assessed its effectiveness across various intent
types, and performed detailed failure case analyses.

### [322] [Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Fine-Grained Review Comment Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09832)
*Linh Nguyen,Chunhua Liu,Hong Yi Lin,Patanamon Thongtanunam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify code review comments, showing they outperform traditional supervised methods, especially for low-frequency categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of supervised machine learning in classifying code review comments, which requires extensive manual annotation.

Method: Assessing LLMs to classify 17 categories of code review comments and comparing their performance with a state-of-the-art deep learning model.

Result: LLMs outperform the deep learning model, particularly in classifying useful but low-frequency categories, and provide balanced performance across all categories.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a scalable and effective solution for code review analytics, improving the code review process.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial practice in software development. As code review
nowadays is lightweight, various issues can be identified, and sometimes, they
can be trivial. Research has investigated automated approaches to classify
review comments to gauge the effectiveness of code reviews. However, previous
studies have primarily relied on supervised machine learning, which requires
extensive manual annotation to train the models effectively. To address this
limitation, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to
classify code review comments. We assess the performance of LLMs to classify 17
categories of code review comments. Our results show that LLMs can classify
code review comments, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach using a
trained deep learning model. In particular, LLMs achieve better accuracy in
classifying the five most useful categories, which the state-of-the-art
approach struggles with due to low training examples. Rather than relying
solely on a specific small training data distribution, our results show that
LLMs provide balanced performance across high- and low-frequency categories.
These results suggest that the LLMs could offer a scalable solution for code
review analytics to improve the effectiveness of the code review process.

### [323] [A pseudo-inverse of a line graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09412)
*Sevvandi Kandanaarachchi,Philip Kilby,Cheng Soon Ong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores recovering the root graph from perturbed line graphs using a linear integer program and spectral norm analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define an inverse operation for line graphs, especially when perturbations exist, enabling recovery of the original root graph.

Method: Proposes a linear integer program to minimize edge edits in the line graph, ensuring a root graph exists, and uses spectral norm for theoretical validation.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results confirm the method's effectiveness, demonstrated on Erdős-Rényi graphs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully defines a pseudo-inverse for line graphs, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Line graphs are an alternative representation of graphs where each vertex of
the original (root) graph becomes an edge. However not all graphs have a
corresponding root graph, hence the transformation from graphs to line graphs
is not invertible. We investigate the case when there is a small perturbation
in the space of line graphs, and try to recover the corresponding root graph,
essentially defining the inverse of the line graph operation. We propose a
linear integer program that edits the smallest number of edges in the line
graph, that allow a root graph to be found. We use the spectral norm to
theoretically prove that such a pseudo-inverse operation is well behaved.
Illustrative empirical experiments on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our
theoretical results work in practice.

### [324] [Scalable h-adaptive probabilistic solver for time-independent and time-dependent systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09623)
*Akshay Thakur,Sawan Kumar,Matthew Zahr,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A scalable probabilistic solver for PDEs reduces computational costs via stochastic dual descent and adaptive collocation point selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational cost of probabilistic PDE solvers, which scales cubically with collocation points, hindering large-scale applications.

Method: Uses stochastic dual descent to lower per-iteration complexity (cubic to linear) and clustering-based active learning to optimize collocation point selection.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy on benchmark PDEs, including 2D/3D elliptic and time-dependent parabolic problems, showing scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed solver efficiently scales to large collocation points, making probabilistic PDE solving feasible for broader applications.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) within the framework of
probabilistic numerics offers a principled approach to quantifying epistemic
uncertainty arising from discretization. By leveraging Gaussian process
regression and imposing the governing PDE as a constraint at a finite set of
collocation points, probabilistic numerics delivers mesh-free solutions at
arbitrary locations. However, the high computational cost, which scales
cubically with the number of collocation points, remains a critical bottleneck,
particularly for large-scale or high-dimensional problems. We propose a
scalable enhancement to this paradigm through two key innovations. First, we
develop a stochastic dual descent algorithm that reduces the per-iteration
complexity from cubic to linear in the number of collocation points, enabling
tractable inference. Second, we exploit a clustering-based active learning
strategy that adaptively selects collocation points to maximize information
gain while minimizing computational expense. Together, these contributions
result in an $h$-adaptive probabilistic solver that can scale to a large number
of collocation points. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver on
benchmark PDEs, including two- and three-dimensional steady-state elliptic
problems, as well as a time-dependent parabolic PDE formulated in a space-time
setting.

### [325] [Structured Kernel Regression VAE: A Computationally Efficient Surrogate for GP-VAEs in ICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09721)
*Yuan-Hao Wei,Fu-Hao Deng,Lin-Yong Cui,Yan-Jie Sun*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: SKR-VAE improves interpretability and efficiency in generative models by avoiding costly GP kernel matrix inversion while maintaining ICA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the interpretability and controllability of generative models by disentangling latent variables efficiently.

Method: Proposes SKR-VAE, which structures latent variable priors using kernel functions more efficiently than GP-VAE, avoiding expensive computations.

Result: SKR-VAE maintains ICA performance with greater computational efficiency and reduced burden compared to GP-VAE.

Conclusion: SKR-VAE offers a scalable and efficient alternative to GP-VAE for disentangling latent variables in generative models.

Abstract: The interpretability of generative models is considered a key factor in
demonstrating their effectiveness and controllability. The generated data are
believed to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.
Therefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or
performing Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space
helps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features
affecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of
generative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
combine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse
process of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.
In some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for
each dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each
dimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different
dimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs
impose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource
consumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different
temporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring
the priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel
functions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent
dimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed
Structured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more
efficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs.
This research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE
achieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced
computational burden compared to GP-VAE.

*Xuanru Zhou,Cheng Li,Shuqiang Wang,Ye Li,Tao Tan,Hairong Zheng,Shanshan Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper reviews generative AI's role in medical imaging, covering GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and multimodal architectures. It evaluates their clinical applications, challenges, and future potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize recent advances in generative AI for medical imaging and assess its clinical impact, addressing challenges like data scarcity and standardization.

Method: Systematic examination of generative models across imaging workflows, proposing a three-tiered evaluation framework (pixel, feature, task levels).

Result: Generative AI enhances imaging workflows but faces obstacles like domain shift, hallucination risks, privacy, and regulatory issues.

Conclusion: The review guides future research by highlighting technical progress and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to advance clinically integrated AI systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical
imaging by enabling capabilities such as data synthesis, image enhancement,
modality translation, and spatiotemporal modeling. This review presents a
comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of recent advances in generative
modeling including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational
autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, and emerging multimodal foundation
architectures and evaluates their expanding roles across the clinical imaging
continuum. We systematically examine how generative AI contributes to key
stages of the imaging workflow, from acquisition and reconstruction to
cross-modality synthesis, diagnostic support, and treatment planning. Emphasis
is placed on both retrospective and prospective clinical scenarios, where
generative models help address longstanding challenges such as data scarcity,
standardization, and integration across modalities. To promote rigorous
benchmarking and translational readiness, we propose a three-tiered evaluation
framework encompassing pixel-level fidelity, feature-level realism, and
task-level clinical relevance. We also identify critical obstacles to
real-world deployment, including generalization under domain shift,
hallucination risk, data privacy concerns, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we
explore the convergence of generative AI with large-scale foundation models,
highlighting how this synergy may enable the next generation of scalable,
reliable, and clinically integrated imaging systems. By charting technical
progress and translational pathways, this review aims to guide future research
and foster interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of AI, medicine,
and biomedical engineering.

### [327] [Hybrid(Transformer+CNN)-based Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09189)
*Madan Baduwal*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid Transformer + CNN model improves polyp segmentation by addressing challenges like ill-defined boundaries and endoscopic artifacts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is challenging due to variations in size, shape, imaging conditions, and artifacts. Existing deep learning models struggle with these complexities.

Method: A hybrid architecture combining Transformer and CNN is proposed, featuring boundary-aware attention for ill-defined margins and robust feature extraction for artifacts.

Result: The model achieves significant improvements in recall (0.9555, +1.76%) and accuracy (0.9849, +0.07%), demonstrating better artifact resilience.

Conclusion: The hybrid model enhances polyp segmentation accuracy and robustness, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Colonoscopy is still the main method of detection and segmentation of colonic
polyps, and recent advancements in deep learning networks such as U-Net,
ResUNet, Swin-UNet, and PraNet have made outstanding performance in polyp
segmentation. Yet, the problem is extremely challenging due to high variation
in size, shape, endoscopy types, lighting, imaging protocols, and ill-defined
boundaries (fluid, folds) of the polyps, rendering accurate segmentation a
challenging and problematic task. To address these critical challenges in polyp
segmentation, we introduce a hybrid (Transformer + CNN) model that is crafted
to enhance robustness against evolving polyp characteristics. Our hybrid
architecture demonstrates superior performance over existing solutions,
particularly in addressing two critical challenges: (1) accurate segmentation
of polyps with ill-defined margins through boundary-aware attention mechanisms,
and (2) robust feature extraction in the presence of common endoscopic
artifacts, including specular highlights, motion blur, and fluid occlusions.
Quantitative evaluations reveal significant improvements in segmentation
accuracy (Recall improved by 1.76%, i.e., 0.9555, accuracy improved by 0.07%,
i.e., 0.9849) and artifact resilience compared to state-of-the-art polyp
segmentation methods.

*Maria Boyko,Aleksandra Beliaeva,Dmitriy Kornilov,Alexander Bernstein,Maxim Sharaev*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: impuTMAE is a transformer-based model for multimodal medical data, handling missing modalities and improving glioma survival prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prognostic models by integrating diverse medical data (omics, imaging, clinical) despite their complexity and incompleteness.

Method: Introduces impuTMAE, a transformer-based approach with multimodal pre-training, imputing missing data by reconstructing masked patches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in glioma survival prediction using TCGA-GBM/LGG and BraTS datasets.

Conclusion: impuTMAE effectively handles missing modalities and improves multimodal learning, advancing prognostic modeling.

Abstract: The use of diverse modalities, such as omics, medical images, and clinical
data can not only improve the performance of prognostic models but also deepen
an understanding of disease mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel
treatment approaches. However, medical data are complex, often incomplete, and
contains missing modalities, making effective handling its crucial for training
multimodal models. We introduce impuTMAE, a novel transformer-based end-to-end
approach with an efficient multimodal pre-training strategy. It learns inter-
and intra-modal interactions while simultaneously imputing missing modalities
by reconstructing masked patches. Our model is pre-trained on heterogeneous,
incomplete data and fine-tuned for glioma survival prediction using
TCGA-GBM/LGG and BraTS datasets, integrating five modalities: genetic (DNAm,
RNA-seq), imaging (MRI, WSI), and clinical data. By addressing missing data
during pre-training and enabling efficient resource utilization, impuTMAE
surpasses prior multimodal approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance
in glioma patient survival prediction. Our code is available at

*Asim Ukaye,Numan Saeed,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A federated learning approach for universal segmentation in diverse abdominal CT datasets, using model and predictive uncertainty for improved aggregation and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in using heterogeneous CT datasets with limited and disjoint organ labels while preserving patient privacy.

Method: Leverages stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate model weight distributions, aggregates parameters using Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance, and quantifies prediction uncertainty.

Result: Improves federated aggregation and uncertainty-weighted inference, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances segmentation quality and provides confidence measures for clinical use.

Abstract: Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different
scanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels
for a limited and often disjoint set of organs. Using these heterogeneous data
effectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work
presents a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation
across diverse abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for
aggregation and predictive uncertainty for inference. Our approach leverages
the inherent noise in stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a
distribution over the model weights to provide an on-the-go uncertainty over
the model parameters at the client level. The parameters are then aggregated at
the server using the additional uncertainty information using a
Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the
proposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the
uncertainty from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for
clinical decision-making. In line with recent work shown, predictive
uncertainty is utilized in the inference stage to improve predictive
performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation and
uncertainty-weighted inference compared to previously established baselines.

*Jinho Kim,Marcel Dominik Nickel,Florian Knoll*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Zero-shot self-supervised learning reduces breath-hold times in MRCP, achieving quality comparable to respiratory-triggered MRCP, with shallow training cutting computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce breath-hold times in MRCP while maintaining image quality, addressing the impracticality of long breath-holds in clinical settings.

Method: Evaluated zero-shot reconstruction against parallel imaging and compressed sensing, using a pretrained network to reduce training time.

Result: Zero-shot improved image quality over compressed sensing, matching respiratory-triggered MRCP, with shallow training reducing training time from 271 to 11 minutes.

Conclusion: Zero-shot learning enables high-quality MRCP with shorter breath-holds, and shallow training makes it clinically feasible.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of applying zero-shot self-supervised
learning reconstruction to reduce breath-hold times in magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Methods: Breath-hold MRCP was acquired from 11
healthy volunteers on a 3T scanner using an incoherent k-space sampling pattern
leading to a breath-hold duration of 14s. We evaluated zero-shot reconstruction
of breath-hold MRCP against parallel imaging of respiratory-triggered MRCP
acquired in 338s on average and compressed sensing reconstruction of
breath-hold MRCP. To address the long computation times of zero-shot trainings,
we used a training approach that leverages a pretrained network to reduce
backpropagation depth during training. Results: Zero-shot learning
reconstruction significantly improved visual image quality compared to
compressed sensing reconstruction, particularly in terms of signal-to-noise
ratio and ductal delineation, and reached a level of quality comparable to that
of successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing
patterns. Shallow training provided nearly equivalent reconstruction
performance with a training time of 11 minutes in comparison to 271 minutes for
a conventional zero-shot training. Conclusion: Zero-shot learning delivers
high-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and shallow
training offers a practical solution for translation to time-constrained
clinical workflows.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A system for explaining deep learning models in medical image analysis, using human-machine-VLM interaction to test and quantify explanations in computational pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure clinical integration of AI models by verifying if they rely on valid features or spurious ones, and to potentially uncover biological insights.

Method: Proposes a system with an AI-integrated slide viewer for testing explanations and quantifying their predictiveness using vision-language models.

Result: The system can qualitatively test and quantifiably distinguish competing explanations, advancing from explainable to explained AI.

Conclusion: Provides a practical approach to improve AI explanations in digital pathology, with potential broader applications.

Abstract: Explaining deep learning models is essential for clinical integration of
medical image analysis systems. A good explanation highlights if a model
depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset
of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although
techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement
tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a
human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in
computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide
images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run
sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2)
quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose
vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to
qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish
competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to
explained AI in digital pathology and beyond. Code and prompts are available at

TL;DR: AMRG is the first end-to-end framework for generating mammography reports using large vision-language models, achieving strong performance in language and clinical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mammography report generation is underexplored in medical AI, with challenges like multiview reasoning and unstructured language.

Method: Uses MedGemma-4B-it, a domain-specialized VLM, with LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, trained on the DMID dataset.

Result: Achieves ROUGE-L 0.5691, METEOR 0.6152, CIDEr 0.5818, and BI-RADS accuracy 0.5582, with improved diagnostic consistency.

Conclusion: AMRG provides a scalable foundation for radiology report generation and advances multimodal medical AI research.

Abstract: Mammography report generation is a critical yet underexplored task in medical
AI, characterized by challenges such as multiview image reasoning,
high-resolution visual cues, and unstructured radiologic language. In this
work, we introduce AMRG (Automatic Mammography Report Generation), the first
end-to-end framework for generating narrative mammography reports using large
vision-language models (VLMs). Building upon MedGemma-4B-it-a
domain-specialized, instruction-tuned VLM-we employ a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling
lightweight adaptation with minimal computational overhead. We train and
evaluate AMRG on DMID, a publicly available dataset of paired high-resolution
mammograms and diagnostic reports. This work establishes the first reproducible
benchmark for mammography report generation, addressing a longstanding gap in
multimodal clinical AI. We systematically explore LoRA hyperparameter
configurations and conduct comparative experiments across multiple VLM
backbones, including both domain-specific and general-purpose models under a
unified tuning protocol. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across
both language generation and clinical metrics, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.5691, METEOR of 0.6152, CIDEr of 0.5818, and BI-RADS accuracy of 0.5582.
Qualitative analysis further highlights improved diagnostic consistency and
reduced hallucinations. AMRG offers a scalable and adaptable foundation for
radiology report generation and paves the way for future research in multimodal
medical AI.

Motivation: Multimodal data enhances brain disorder diagnoses, but incomplete data poses challenges. Traditional methods like subsampling or zero-filling reduce accuracy or introduce biases.

Method: Proposed a generative adversarial network to reconstruct missing modalities (T1-weighted MRI and functional network connectivity) while preserving disease patterns.

Result: 9% improvement in Alzheimer's disease classification accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Generative models are effective for imputing missing multimodal neuroimaging data, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal data analysis can lead to more accurate diagnoses of brain
disorders due to the complementary information that each modality adds.
However, a major challenge of using multimodal datasets in the neuroimaging
field is incomplete data, where some of the modalities are missing for certain
subjects. Hence, effective strategies are needed for completing the data.
Traditional methods, such as subsampling or zero-filling, may reduce the
accuracy of predictions or introduce unintended biases. In contrast, advanced
methods such as generative models have emerged as promising solutions without
these limitations. In this study, we proposed a generative adversarial network
method designed to reconstruct missing modalities from existing ones while
preserving the disease patterns. We used T1-weighted structural magnetic
resonance imaging and functional network connectivity as two modalities. Our
findings showed a 9% improvement in the classification accuracy for Alzheimer's
disease versus cognitive normal groups when using our generative imputation
method compared to the traditional approaches.

*Hongli Chen,Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Yingxuan Ren,Jing Hao,Fangfang Tang,Xiaohao Cai,Shanshan Shan,Feng Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HiFi-Mamba improves MRI reconstruction by addressing limitations of Mamba variants, using a dual-stream architecture with spectral decoupling and adaptive state-space modulation for better high-frequency detail preservation and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba variants for MRI reconstruction lack sensitivity to high-frequency details and rely on redundant scanning, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: HiFi-Mamba employs a dual-stream architecture with WL blocks for spectral decoupling and HiFi-Mamba blocks for adaptive high-frequency integration and unidirectional traversal.

Result: HiFi-Mamba outperforms CNN, Transformer, and other Mamba-based models in accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: HiFi-Mamba offers a superior solution for high-fidelity MRI reconstruction by combining spectral decoupling and efficient long-range modeling.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data remains
a challenging problem in MRI. While Mamba variants for vision tasks offer
promising long-range modeling capabilities with linear-time complexity, their
direct application to MRI reconstruction inherits two key limitations: (1)
insensitivity to high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) reliance on
redundant multi-directional scanning. To address these limitations, we
introduce High-Fidelity Mamba (HiFi-Mamba), a novel dual-stream Mamba-based
architecture comprising stacked W-Laplacian (WL) and HiFi-Mamba blocks.
Specifically, the WL block performs fidelity-preserving spectral decoupling,
producing complementary low- and high-frequency streams. This separation
enables the HiFi-Mamba block to focus on low-frequency structures, enhancing
global feature modeling. Concurrently, the HiFi-Mamba block selectively
integrates high-frequency features through adaptive state-space modulation,
preserving comprehensive spectral details. To eliminate the scanning
redundancy, the HiFi-Mamba block adopts a streamlined unidirectional traversal
strategy that preserves long-range modeling capability with improved
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard MRI reconstruction
benchmarks demonstrate that HiFi-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art CNN-based, Transformer-based, and other Mamba-based models in
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining a compact and efficient model design.

*Baraa Al Jorf,Farah Shamout*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MedPatch is a multi-stage multimodal fusion architecture for clinical prediction tasks, addressing data heterogeneity and missing modalities via confidence-guided patching. It outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical data is heterogeneous, limited, and sparse, hindering model performance. MedPatch aims to integrate multimodal data effectively.

Method: MedPatch uses multi-stage fusion, missingness-aware handling, and joint fusion with confidence-guided patching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-hospital mortality prediction and clinical condition classification.

Conclusion: Confidence-guided multi-stage fusion effectively addresses multimodal data challenges, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integration of information across
various data modalities, such as clinical time-series, medical images and
textual reports. Compared to other domains, real-world medical data is
heterogeneous in nature, limited in size, and sparse due to missing modalities.
This significantly limits model performance in clinical prediction tasks.
Inspired by clinical workflows, we introduce MedPatch, a multi-stage multimodal
fusion architecture, which seamlessly integrates multiple modalities via
confidence-guided patching. MedPatch comprises three main components: (i) a
multi-stage fusion strategy that leverages joint and late fusion
simultaneously, (ii) a missingness-aware module that handles sparse samples
with missing modalities, (iii) a joint fusion module that clusters latent token
patches based on calibrated unimodal token-level confidence. We evaluated
MedPatch using real-world data consisting of clinical time-series data, chest
X-ray images, radiology reports, and discharge notes extracted from the
MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR, and MIMIC-Notes datasets on two benchmark tasks, namely
in-hospital mortality prediction and clinical condition classification.
Compared to existing baselines, MedPatch achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work highlights the effectiveness of confidence-guided multi-stage fusion
in addressing the heterogeneity of multimodal data, and establishes new
state-of-the-art benchmark results for clinical prediction tasks.

TL;DR: SurLonFormer, a Transformer-based model, improves survival analysis by integrating longitudinal medical images and structured data, addressing censored data, scalability, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to fully utilize censored data, overlook correlations in longitudinal images, and lack interpretability.

Method: SurLonFormer combines a Vision Encoder, Sequence Encoder, and Survival Encoder (Cox model) for spatial, temporal, and survival feature integration.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in predictive performance and identifies disease-related biomarkers in Alzheimer's analysis.

Conclusion: SurLonFormer offers a scalable, interpretable solution for survival prediction using longitudinal medical images.

Abstract: Survival analysis utilizing multiple longitudinal medical images plays a
pivotal role in the early detection and prognosis of diseases by providing
insight beyond single-image evaluations. However, current methodologies often
inadequately utilize censored data, overlook correlations among longitudinal
images measured over multiple time points, and lack interpretability. We
introduce SurLonFormer, a novel Transformer-based neural network that
integrates longitudinal medical imaging with structured data for survival
prediction. Our architecture comprises three key components: a Vision Encoder
for extracting spatial features, a Sequence Encoder for aggregating temporal
information, and a Survival Encoder based on the Cox proportional hazards
model. This framework effectively incorporates censored data, addresses
scalability issues, and enhances interpretability through occlusion sensitivity
analysis and dynamic survival prediction. Extensive simulations and a
real-world application in Alzheimer's disease analysis demonstrate that
SurLonFormer achieves superior predictive performance and successfully
identifies disease-related imaging biomarkers.

*Xiaojiao Xiao,Jianfeng Zhao,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: T-CACE synthesizes multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI from non-contrast MRI, improving safety and diagnostic efficiency for liver cancer assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing risks from contrast agents, time-consuming manual assessment, and limited annotated datasets in traditional MRI.

Method: Proposes T-CACE with conditional token encoding, dynamic time-aware attention mask, and temporal classification consistency for smooth, physiologically plausible transitions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification on two liver MRI datasets.

Conclusion: T-CACE offers a safer, efficient, and reliable alternative to traditional contrast-enhanced imaging for liver lesion assessment.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a leading modality for the diagnosis of
liver cancer, significantly improving the classification of the lesion and
patient outcomes. However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks
from contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and
limited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
Time-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for
synthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from
non-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a
conditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and
temporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic
time-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase
information flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth
and physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a
constraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion
classification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further
enhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent
liver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework
offers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional
contrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and
reliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is
publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE.

### [338] [Can AI Keep a Secret? Contextual Integrity Verification: A Provable Security Architecture for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09288)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CIV is a security architecture for LLMs that ensures token-level trust and prevents prompt injection attacks with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreak attacks, and existing heuristic guardrails are ineffective.

Method: CIV uses cryptographically signed provenance labels and a source-trust lattice enforced via a pre-softmax hard attention mask.

Result: CIV achieves 0% attack success rate, 93.1% token-level similarity, and no perplexity degradation on benign tasks.

Conclusion: CIV is a lightweight, drop-in solution for protecting LLMs like Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain acutely vulnerable to prompt injection
and related jailbreak attacks; heuristic guardrails (rules, filters, LLM
judges) are routinely bypassed. We present Contextual Integrity Verification
(CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically
signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice
inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional
FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference
guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust
representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of
prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack
success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level
similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we
note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV
is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in
protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference
implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus
to support reproducible research.

### [339] [Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache in LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09442)
*Zhifan Luo,Shuo Shao,Su Zhang,Lijing Zhou,Yuke Hu,Chenxu Zhao,Zhihao Liu,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes privacy risks in KV-cache for LLM inference, introduces three attack methods, and proposes KV-Cloak as a defense with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV-cache accelerates LLM inference but poses underexplored privacy risks, allowing attackers to reconstruct sensitive inputs.

Method: Three attack vectors (Inversion, Collision, Injection) are designed to exploit KV-cache vulnerabilities. KV-Cloak, a defense using reversible matrix obfuscation and operator fusion, is proposed.

Result: KV-Cloak effectively mitigates attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise without degrading model accuracy or performance.

Conclusion: KV-Cloak offers a practical, lightweight solution to secure KV-cache, enabling trustworthy LLM deployment.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations
(Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental
mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this
efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks.
This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities,
demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly
from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a
direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack,
and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the
practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this,
we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism.
KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with
operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that
KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction
quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with
virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead,
offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

*Shuang Liang,Zhihao Xu,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue,Xiting Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LoD is an unsupervised framework for detecting jailbreak attacks in LVLMs using anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and existing detection methods rely on heuristic rules, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: LoD uses Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors (MSCAV) and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder to detect anomalies in safe input distributions.

Result: LoD achieves an average AUROC of 0.9951, improving by up to 38.89% over baselines.

Conclusion: LoD provides a principled, unsupervised solution for accurate and unified jailbreak detection in LVLMs.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. Although
recent detection works have shifted to internal representations due to their
rich cross-modal information, most methods rely on heuristic rules rather than
principled objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these
limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised
framework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD
introduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors
(MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across
modalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution
of MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction
errors. By training the auto-encoder (AE) solely on safe samples without attack
labels, LoD naturally identifies jailbreak inputs as distributional anomalies,
enabling accurate and unified detection of jailbreak attacks. Comprehensive
experiments on three different LVLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that LoD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUROC of 0.9951 and an
improvement of up to 38.89% in the minimum AUROC over the strongest baselines.

TL;DR: A novel method for detecting identity cloning in social-sensor cloud services, combining deep forest models and cryptography-based authentication, outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rise in identity cloning incidents and the shortcomings of current methods, such as poor performance and lack of large-scale evaluations.

Method: Uses a weakly supervised deep forest model for similar identity detection and a cryptography-based protocol for authentication.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and superior performance on a large real-world dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively detects identity cloning, offering a robust solution for social-sensor cloud services.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rising trend in social-sensor cloud identity
cloning incidents. However, existing approaches suffer from unsatisfactory
performance, a lack of solutions for detecting duplicated accounts, and a lack
of large-scale evaluations on real-world datasets. We introduce a novel method
for detecting identity cloning in social-sensor cloud service providers. Our
proposed technique consists of two primary components: 1) a similar identity
detection method and 2) a cryptography-based authentication protocol.
Initially, we developed a weakly supervised deep forest model to identify
similar identities using non-privacy-sensitive user profile features provided
by the service. Subsequently, we designed a cryptography-based authentication
protocol to verify whether similar identities were generated by the same
provider. Our extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate
the feasibility and superior performance of our technique compared to current
state-of-the-art identity clone detection methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating signature-based detection with machine learning in malware detection, showing improved robustness to adversarial attacks and data drift, but notes limitations like fixed false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems for malware detection often develop signature-based and machine learning components in isolation, missing opportunities to optimize data complexity and defense against adversarial attacks.

Method: The study compares models trained on a comprehensive dataset with those trained only on samples not flagged by signatures, analyzing their performance.

Result: Results show improved robustness against adversarial EXEmples and temporal data drift, but with a fixed lower bound on false positives due to suboptimal rule selection.

Conclusion: The paper highlights limitations and suggests future research to include dynamic analysis for enhancing AI-based malware detection resilience.

Abstract: Malware detection increasingly relies on AI systems that integrate
signature-based detection with machine learning. However, these components are
typically developed and combined in isolation, missing opportunities to reduce
data complexity and strengthen defenses against adversarial EXEmples, carefully
crafted programs designed to evade detection. Hence, in this work we
investigate the influence that signature-based detection exerts on model
training, when they are included inside the training pipeline. Specifically, we
compare models trained on a comprehensive dataset with an AI system whose
machine learning component is trained solely on samples not already flagged by
signatures. Our results demonstrate improved robustness to both adversarial
EXEmples and temporal data drift, although this comes at the cost of a fixed
lower bound on false positives, driven by suboptimal rule selection. We
conclude by discussing these limitations and outlining how future research
could extend AI-based malware detection to include dynamic analysis, thereby
further enhancing system resilience.

*Zijiang Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel feature selection method combining keyword features with traditional features to enhance phishing URL detection, reducing classification error by 30% and achieving 99.68% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in phishing attacks necessitates early detection of malicious URLs to prevent sensitive data leaks and financial losses.

Method: A novel feature selection approach integrating keyword features with traditional features, applied to multiple machine learning algorithms.

Result: The method reduces classification error by 30% on average, with greater impact on small datasets, and achieves 99.68% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances phishing URL detection without relying on third-party services, proving its utility across datasets.

Abstract: Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in
the Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious
website that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the
end-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information
and the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early
detection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers
have proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs
from the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine
learning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a
novel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features.
This method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and
the experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On
average, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large
dataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset.
In addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not
rely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best
result for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has
achieved the accuracy of 99.68%.

TL;DR: A stacking ensemble framework using GNNs for malware detection improves accuracy and interpretability by combining diverse models and attention-based aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for accurate, interpretable, and robust malware detection models in security applications.

Method: Dynamic CFG extraction, two-step embedding, diverse GNN base learners, and attention-based meta-learner for classification and explanation.

Result: Improved classification performance and interpretable malware behavior insights.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances malware detection accuracy and provides model-agnostic explanations.

Abstract: Malware detection in modern computing environments demands models that are
not only accurate but also interpretable and robust to evasive techniques.
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich
structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control
flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited
generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for
graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts
CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through
a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a
distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral
features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented
as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware
instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance
explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique
that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and
fuses them using the learned attention weights. This produces interpretable,
model-agnostic explanations aligned with the final ensemble decision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves classification
performance while providing insightful interpretations of malware behavior.

TL;DR: The study explores hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) using quantum generators for latent vectors, comparing them to classical GANs. Results show competitive performance for the 7-qubit HQCGAN, validating quantum circuits as feasible latent priors in GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generative modeling by leveraging quantum circuits for latent representations in GANs, addressing limitations of classical noise distributions.

Method: Implemented HQCGANs with 3, 5, and 7 qubits using Qiskit's AerSimulator, trained on binary MNIST, and evaluated with FID and KID metrics.

Result: The classical GAN performed best, but the 7-qubit HQCGAN showed competitive results, narrowing the performance gap over time. The 3-qubit model had convergence limitations.

Conclusion: HQCGANs are feasible for generative modeling in the NISQ era, with potential to improve performance despite quantum hardware constraints.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained
by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical
noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs
(HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum
circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a
classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using
Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum
devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the
low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are
trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and
Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN
achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance,
narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier
convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training
time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the
feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures,
highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the
constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

Conclusion: Fundamental challenges exist in QGANs' generalization, with broader implications for quantum generative models.

Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks
(QGANs) in image generations tasks. Our analysis centers on fully quantum
implementations of both the generator and discriminator. Through extensive
numerical testing of current main architectures, we find that QGANs struggle to
generalize across datasets, converging on merely the average representation of
the training data. When the output of the generator is a pure-state, we
analytically derive a lower bound for the discriminator quality given by the
fidelity between the pure-state output of the generator and the target data
distribution, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the limitations
observed in current models. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in the
generalization capabilities of existing quantum generative models. While our
analysis focuses on QGANs, the results carry broader implications for the
performance of related quantum generative models.

Motivation: Addresses the limited battery capacity of aerial agents, which restricts coverage and efficiency in radio map reconstruction for low-altitude wireless connectivity.

Method: Integrates a Bayesian neural network for spatial uncertainty estimation and an attention-based reinforcement learning policy for global trajectory planning.

Result: URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in radio map reconstruction.

Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become
essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms.
Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using
waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity
significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose
an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly
leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach
integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that
estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based
reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a
probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and
energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent,
non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative
regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that
URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.

*Honggang Jia,Nan Cheng,Xiucheng Wang,Conghao Zhou,Ruijin Sun,Xuemin,Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture, improves accuracy and efficiency in radio map construction for 6G by combining global and local feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in deep learning-based radio map construction for 6G services.

Method: Uses a Mamba-Convolutional block: Mamba branch for global dependencies (linear complexity) and convolutional branch for local features.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than existing methods (e.g., diffusion models), operates 20x faster, and uses only 2.9% of parameters.

Conclusion: RadioMamba offers a viable solution for real-time intelligent optimization in next-gen wireless systems.

Abstract: Radio map (RM) has recently attracted much attention since it can provide
real-time and accurate spatial channel information for 6G services and
applications. However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction
exhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce
RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the
trade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range
spatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics.
RadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures
these global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel
convolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates
feature representations that capture both global context and local detail.
Experiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing
methods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and
using only 2.9\% of the model parameters. By improving both accuracy and
efficiency, RadioMamba presents a viable approach for real-time intelligent
optimization in next generation wireless systems.

### [351] [Cowpox: Towards the Immunity of VLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09230)
*Yutong Wu,Jie Zhang,Yiming Li,Chao Zhang,Qing Guo,Nils Lukas,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Cowpox is a defense approach to enhance robustness in multi-agent systems by limiting infection spread and immunizing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems lack robustness, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can spread and compromise the entire system.

Method: Cowpox uses a distributed mechanism to generate and distribute a cure sample, immunizing agents pre-exposure and aiding recovery of infected ones.

Result: Empirical and theoretical results show Cowpox effectively improves system robustness.

Conclusion: Cowpox provides a provable solution to enhance the robustness of multi-agent systems against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision Language Model (VLM)-based agents are stateful, autonomous entities
capable of perceiving and interacting with their environments through vision
and language. Multi-agent systems comprise specialized agents who collaborate
to solve a (complex) task. A core security property is robustness, stating that
the system should maintain its integrity under adversarial attacks. However,
the design of existing multi-agent systems lacks the robustness consideration,
as a successful exploit against one agent can spread and infect other agents to
undermine the entire system's assurance. To address this, we propose a new
defense approach, Cowpox, to provably enhance the robustness of multi-agent
systems. It incorporates a distributed mechanism, which improves the recovery
rate of agents by limiting the expected number of infections to other agents.
The core idea is to generate and distribute a special cure sample that
immunizes an agent against the attack before exposure and helps recover the
already infected agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cowpox empirically
and provide theoretical robustness guarantees.

### [352] [Emergence of Hierarchies in Multi-Agent Self-Organizing Systems Pursuing a Joint Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09541)
*Gang Chen,Guoxin Wang,Anton van Beek,Zhenjun Ming,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores how dependency hierarchies emerge in multi-agent self-organizing systems (MASOS) during task execution, using MARL for analysis. Hierarchies arise dynamically from agents' collective actions and adapt to task changes, influenced by environment and initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unpredictable emergent behaviors in MASOS, specifically how dependency hierarchies form and evolve during collaborative tasks.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is used to train MASOS for a box-pushing task. Inter-agent dependencies are quantified by analyzing action gradients, and hierarchies are studied through dependency aggregation.

Result: Hierarchies emerge organically from collective objectives, not pre-configured rules. They evolve dynamically with task changes and are influenced by environment and initialization. "Talent" and "Effort" also play roles in hierarchy formation.

Conclusion: Dependency hierarchies in MASOS arise naturally from agents' interactions and adapt to task demands, shaped by environment and agent attributes like "Talent" and "Effort."

Abstract: Multi-agent self-organizing systems (MASOS) exhibit key characteristics
including scalability, adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, which have
contributed to their extensive application across various fields. However, the
self-organizing nature of MASOS also introduces elements of unpredictability in
their emergent behaviors. This paper focuses on the emergence of dependency
hierarchies during task execution, aiming to understand how such hierarchies
arise from agents' collective pursuit of the joint objective, how they evolve
dynamically, and what factors govern their development. To investigate this
phenomenon, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to train
MASOS for a collaborative box-pushing task. By calculating the gradients of
each agent's actions in relation to the states of other agents, the inter-agent
dependencies are quantified, and the emergence of hierarchies is analyzed
through the aggregation of these dependencies. Our results demonstrate that
hierarchies emerge dynamically as agents work towards a joint objective, with
these hierarchies evolving in response to changing task requirements. Notably,
these dependency hierarchies emerge organically in response to the shared
objective, rather than being a consequence of pre-configured rules or
parameters that can be fine-tuned to achieve specific results. Furthermore, the
emergence of hierarchies is influenced by the task environment and network
initialization conditions. Additionally, hierarchies in MASOS emerge from the
dynamic interplay between agents' "Talent" and "Effort" within the
"Environment." "Talent" determines an agent's initial influence on collective
decision-making, while continuous "Effort" within the "Environment" enables
agents to shift their roles and positions within the system.

*Tianxing Zhou,Christopher A. Theissen,S. Jean Feeser,William M. J. Best,Adam J. Burgasser,Kelle L. Cruz,Lexu Zhao*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper explores ML methods for classifying spectral types of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, achieving high accuracy with KNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate spectral classification for large datasets, addressing limitations of manual methods.

Method: Used RF, SVM, and KNN models on binned fluxes from low-resolution near-infrared spectra.

Result: KNN achieved 95.5% accuracy within ±1 SpT and 89.5% for gravity/metallicity subclasses.

Conclusion: ML is effective for spectral classification, with KNN outperforming other models.

Abstract: Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play
a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and
demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the
classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of
spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral
indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated
approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as
large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets
containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in
spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared
spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and
metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as
input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built
using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor
(KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed
the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and
metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN)
classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface
gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the
dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources
with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band
plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the
highest feature importance.

Computing (HPC) to parallelise computations, in particular for robustness
testing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge experiential gaps caused by neurological conditions affecting vision, enabling others to understand these conditions better.

Result: Vision Transformers outperform CNNs and generative methods, establishing a benchmark for neurological perception simulation.

Conclusion: The framework aids medical education, empathy training, and advances understanding of neural networks modeling atypical perception.

Abstract: Neurological conditions affecting visual perception create profound
experiential divides between affected individuals and their caregivers,
families, and medical professionals. We present the Perceptual Reality
Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural
architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with
scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from
natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to
experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention
deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision,
and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet
and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures
achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative
approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for
neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific
perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides
quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has
immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive
technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how
neural networks can model atypical human perception.

*Yao Li,Yicheng Liu,Shirou Wang*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: DeepWKB is a deep learning method for estimating the invariant distribution of perturbed systems using WKB approximation, addressing challenges in small noise regimes and higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with estimating invariant distributions in singular regimes (small noise) and higher-dimensional systems. DeepWKB aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: DeepWKB combines Monte Carlo data and PDEs to compute the quasi-potential (V) and Z_ε separately, enabling accurate approximation of the invariant distribution.

Result: The method successfully approximates distributions in small noise regimes and scales to higher-dimensional systems with non-trivial attractors.

Conclusion: DeepWKB offers a scalable, flexible solution for quasi-potential computation, aiding rare event analysis and stochastic stability in complex systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning method, called DeepWKB, for
estimating the invariant distribution of randomly perturbed systems via its
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation $u_\epsilon(x) = Q(\epsilon)^{-1}
Z_\epsilon(x) \exp\{-V(x)/\epsilon\}$, where $V$ is known as the
quasi-potential, $\epsilon$ denotes the noise strength, and $Q(\epsilon)$ is
the normalization factor. By utilizing both Monte Carlo data and the partial
differential equations satisfied by $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$, the DeepWKB method
computes $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$ separately. This enables an approximation of the
invariant distribution in the singular regime where $\epsilon$ is sufficiently
small, which remains a significant challenge for most existing methods.
Moreover, the DeepWKB method is applicable to higher-dimensional stochastic
systems whose deterministic counterparts admit non-trivial attractors. In
particular, it provides a scalable and flexible alternative for computing the
quasi-potential, which plays a key role in the analysis of rare events,
metastability, and the stochastic stability of complex systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-generated arguments influence human opinions and perceptions, particularly in ethically nuanced contexts.

Method: A user study with 62 participants, pre-post surveys, and linguistic/rhetorical analysis of ChatGPT's texts.

Result: ChatGPT produces structured arguments but lacks stylistic richness; ethical concerns often persist or intensify post-interaction.

Conclusion: AI-generated persuasion is limited in ethically sensitive areas, suggesting need for further research.

Abstract: This study examines the rhetorical and linguistic features of argumentative
texts generated by ChatGPT on ethically nuanced topics and investigates their
persuasive impact on human readers.Through a user study involving 62
participants and pre-post interaction surveys, the paper analyzes how exposure
to AI-generated arguments affects opinion change and user perception. A
linguistic and rhetorical analysis of the generated texts reveals a consistent
argumentative macrostructure, reliance on formulaic expressions, and limited
stylistic richness. While ChatGPT demonstrates proficiency in constructing
coherent argumentative texts, its persuasive efficacy appears constrained,
particularly on topics involving ethical issues.The study finds that while
participants often acknowledge the benefits highlighted by ChatGPT, ethical
concerns tend to persist or even intensify post-interaction. The results also
demonstrate a variation depending on the topic. These findings highlight new
insights on AI-generated persuasion in ethically sensitive domains and are a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the idea that AI should be ideologically neutral by testing if culturally biased AI can enhance human decision-making.

Method: Randomized trials with 2,500 participants interacting with politically diverse GPT-4o variants on information evaluation tasks.

Result: Partisan AI improved performance, engagement, and reduced bias, especially with opposing views, but was undervalued in trust compared to neutral AI.

Conclusion: Strategic use of diverse cultural biases in AI may improve human decision-making, complicating the notion of AI neutrality.

Abstract: Current AI systems minimize risk by enforcing ideological neutrality, yet
this may introduce automation bias by suppressing cognitive engagement in human
decision-making. We conducted randomized trials with 2,500 participants to test
whether culturally biased AI enhances human decision-making. Participants
interacted with politically diverse GPT-4o variants on information evaluation
tasks. Partisan AI assistants enhanced human performance, increased engagement,
and reduced evaluative bias compared to non-biased counterparts, with amplified
benefits when participants encountered opposing views. These gains carried a
trust penalty: participants underappreciated biased AI and overcredited neutral
systems. Exposing participants to two AIs whose biases flanked human
perspectives closed the perception-performance gap. These findings complicate
conventional wisdom about AI neutrality, suggesting that strategic integration
of diverse cultural biases may foster improved and resilient human
decision-making.

TL;DR: AI-assisted data extraction in health professions education literature reviews shows high consistency with humans for concrete questions but lower for subjective ones, with rare AI inaccuracies compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of AI-assisted data extraction in knowledge syntheses, addressing concerns about AI hallucinations and interpretive differences.

Method: Developed an extraction platform using LLMs, compared AI and human responses across 187 publications, and measured consistency using interrater reliability and thematic similarity.

Result: AI was highly consistent with humans for explicit questions but less so for subjective ones. AI inaccuracies were rare (1.51%), while humans had more (4.37%).

Conclusion: AI can be a trustworthy partner in knowledge synthesis, but human oversight is needed for subjective interpretations.

Abstract: Knowledge syntheses (literature reviews) are essential to health professions
education (HPE), consolidating findings to advance theory and practice.
However, they are labor-intensive, especially during data extraction.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted extraction promises efficiency but raises
concerns about accuracy, making it critical to distinguish AI 'hallucinations'
(fabricated content) from legitimate interpretive differences. We developed an
extraction platform using large language models (LLMs) to automate data
extraction and compared AI to human responses across 187 publications and 17
extraction questions from a published scoping review. AI-human, human-human,
and AI-AI consistencies were measured using interrater reliability
(categorical) and thematic similarity ratings (open-ended). Errors were
identified by comparing extracted responses to source publications. AI was
highly consistent with humans for concrete, explicitly stated questions (e.g.,
title, aims) and lower for questions requiring subjective interpretation or
absent in text (e.g., Kirkpatrick's outcomes, study rationale). Human-human
consistency was not higher than AI-human and showed the same question-dependent
variability. Discordant AI-human responses (769/3179 = 24.2%) were mostly due
to interpretive differences (18.3%); AI inaccuracies were rare (1.51%), while
humans were nearly three times more likely to state inaccuracies (4.37%).
Findings suggest AI accuracy depends more on interpretability than
hallucination. Repeating AI extraction can identify interpretive complexity or
ambiguity, refining processes before human review. AI can be a transparent,
trustworthy partner in knowledge synthesis, though caution is needed to
preserve critical human insights.

Main category: nlin.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantitative method using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) to analyze the entropy of configurations leading to short attractors in Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs), linking it to Wolfram's qualitative classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a quantitative basis for understanding the diverse behaviors of ECAs, which are typically classified qualitatively by Wolfram's scheme.

Method: Adapts the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) to compute the entropy of initial configurations converging to attractors of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps, yielding exact results in the thermodynamic limit.

Result: Class 1 and 2 rules approach maximal entropy quickly, Class 3 rules show low or zero entropy, and Class 4 rules exhibit finite positive entropy. The method quantifies trajectory statistics but is computationally limited to short trajectories.

Conclusion: The method establishes a quantitative link between entropy and Wolfram's classification, offering a precise framework for analyzing ECA behaviors, though computational constraints limit its application to short trajectories.

Abstract: Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) exhibit diverse behaviours often
categorized by Wolfram's qualitative classification. To provide a quantitative
basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of
such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of
all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time
steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the
CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method
(TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p,
c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging
to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such
statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection
between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1
rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$
increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate
cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3
rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short
transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3
rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory
statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts
practical analysis to short trajectories.

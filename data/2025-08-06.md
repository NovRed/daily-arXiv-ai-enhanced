<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the Pymaf network by integrating Transformer-based temporal analysis and multi-scale feature fusion for better 3D human pose estimation.

Method: 1. Transformer feature extraction for low-level features. 2. Feature temporal fusion for video sequences. 3. Spatial pyramid for multi-scale fusion.

Result: PyCAT4 shows significant improvement in pose estimation accuracy on COCO and 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements advance human pose estimation technology effectively.

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these

Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

### [2] [DreamVVT: Mastering Realistic Video Virtual Try-On in the Wild via a Stage-Wise Diffusion Transformer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02807)
*Tongchun Zuo,Zaiyu Huang,Shuliang Ning,Ente Lin,Chao Liang,Zerong Zheng,Jianwen Jiang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao,Xin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVVT is a two-stage framework using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to enhance video virtual try-on (VVT) by leveraging unpaired data and pretrained models for better garment detail preservation and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VVT methods rely on scarce paired datasets and fail to utilize advanced visual models or test-time inputs effectively, leading to poor detail preservation and temporal inconsistency.

Method: DreamVVT uses a two-stage approach: (1) synthesizing high-fidelity keyframe try-on images using a multi-frame model and VLM, and (2) generating coherent video with skeleton maps, motion descriptions, and LoRA-enhanced pretrained models.

Result: DreamVVT outperforms existing methods in preserving garment details and ensuring temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DreamVVT addresses key limitations in VVT by leveraging unpaired data and pretrained models, achieving superior performance in detail preservation and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [3] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Replacing layer normalization (LN) with DynTanh in IJEPA preserves token energy hierarchy, improving model performance and fixing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LN disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, masking semantically important regions and causing artifacts.

Method: Replace LN with DynTanh activation to maintain token energies and prioritize high-energy regions.

Result: Improved ImageNet accuracy (38% to 42.7%) and reduced RMSE (by 0.08) on NYU Depth V2.

Conclusion: Preserving token energies is key for effective self-supervised visual learning.

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [4] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE combines NeRF's photorealistic rendering with Gaussian Splatting's editable structure, enabling real-time, interactive scene manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high-fidelity rendering (NeRF) and editable, structured representations (Gaussian Splatting).

Method: Hybrid model using trainable feature embeddings for Gaussians, conditioned on a NeRF network via RT-GPS for efficient nearest Gaussian search. Multi-resolution hash grid initializes/updates features.

Result: Enables real-time, locality-aware editing and dynamic interaction while maintaining photorealistic quality.

Conclusion: GENIE successfully merges implicit and explicit representations, supporting intuitive editing and physical simulation compatibility.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

### [5] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel coarse-to-fine segmentation framework uses noisy coarse annotations to approximate precise medical image segmentation, outperforming weakly supervised methods and nearing fully supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level medical image annotations are costly and require expertise; coarse annotations offer a practical alternative despite their noise.

Method: Introduces transition matrices to model inaccuracies in coarse annotations, jointly trains on multiple coarse sets, and refines outputs to infer true segmentation.

Result: Validated on cardiac imaging datasets (ACDC, MSCMRseg, UK Biobank), the method outperforms weakly supervised approaches and approaches fully supervised results.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages coarse annotations for precise segmentation, reducing reliance on costly expert annotations.

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [6] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR is a LiDAR detection mimicking model that bridges the gap between high-fidelity but unscalable simulators and scalable but perception-limited traffic simulators by approximating realistic LiDAR detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability limitations of high-fidelity simulators and the lack of perception modeling in microscopic traffic simulators for cooperative perception in autonomous driving.

Method: MIDAR predicts true positives and false negatives from ideal LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features, constructs a Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight graph for occlusion relationships, and employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture for feature propagation.

Result: Achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating detection results from CenterPoint on the nuScenes dataset and validates its utility in CP-based traffic applications.

Conclusion: MIDAR effectively integrates realistic detection modeling into scalable traffic simulators, enhancing applications requiring accurate vehicle observations.

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

### [7] [Evaluation and Analysis of Deep Neural Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on Modern Remote Sensing Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02871)
*J. Alex Hurt,Trevor M. Bajkowski,Grant J. Scott,Curt H. Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares transformer-based and convolutional neural networks for object detection in satellite imagery, showing transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based networks perform on satellite imagery, given their success in NLP and CV, but lack of large-scale comparison in remote sensing.

Method: Evaluates 11 detection algorithms (5 transformer-based, 6 convolutional) on 3 high-resolution satellite datasets, training 33 models.

Result: Transformer-based architectures demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Transformers are highly effective for object detection in satellite imagery, outperforming convolutional networks in this domain.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [8] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)
*Rongxin Jiang,Robert Long,Chenghao Gu,Mingrui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft enhances LVLMs for creative content generation by integrating a multimodal extractor and dynamic prompt module, outperforming baselines in creativity and instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with visual fidelity, creativity, and precise instruction adherence in long-form text generation. VisuCraft aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: VisuCraft uses a multimodal structured information extractor (E) and dynamic prompt generation module (G) to optimize prompts for LVLMs like LLaVA and InstructBLIP.

Result: Evaluated on ImageStoryGen-500K, VisuCraft outperforms baselines in tasks like story generation and poetry, showing significant improvements in creativity and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: VisuCraft effectively enhances LVLMs for sophisticated creative applications, producing imaginative, visually grounded, and user-aligned text.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

### [9] [RDDPM: Robust Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02903)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes robust denoising diffusion models for unsupervised anomaly segmentation using contaminated data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models require normal data for training, limiting real-world applicability. This work addresses scenarios with only contaminated (mixed normal/anomalous) unlabeled data.

Method: Reinterprets denoising diffusion probabilistic models as nonlinear regression, using robust regression to derive a robust version.

Result: Achieves up to 8.08% higher AUROC and 10.37% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed robust diffusion models offer flexibility and superior performance in unsupervised anomaly segmentation with contaminated data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

### [10] [How Would It Sound? Material-Controlled Multimodal Acoustic Profile Generation for Indoor Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02905)
*Mahnoor Fatima Saad,Ziad Al-Halah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating acoustic profiles in indoor scenes based on user-defined material configurations, using an encoder-decoder model to predict Room Impulse Responses (RIRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how materials like carpets and acoustic tiles affect sound in a studio and enable dynamic acoustic profile generation.

Method: A novel encoder-decoder approach encodes scene properties from audio-visual observations and generates RIRs conditioned on user-specified materials.

Result: The model effectively encodes material info and generates high-fidelity RIRs, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses material-controlled acoustic profile generation, supported by a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

### [11] [Following Route Instructions using Large Vision-Language Models: A Comparison between Low-level and Panoramic Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02917)
*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores whether off-the-shelf LVLMs can perform VLN tasks effectively and support both low-level and panoramic action spaces, achieving a 41% success rate on R2R.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs for VLN tasks, as current systems rely on specialized models, leaving general LVLMs underexplored.

Method: Fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model on the R2R dataset and evaluating performance in low-level and panoramic action spaces.

Result: The model achieved a 41% success rate on R2R, showing promise but lagging behind specialized models.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf LVLMs can support VLN tasks but are less effective than models designed specifically for navigation.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

### [12] [How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923)
*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAP estimation in blind deconvolution favors blurry solutions with sparsity-promoting priors. Diffusion-based priors reveal blurry images have higher likelihoods, but local minimizers correspond to sharp images. Overcoming MAP's limitations requires good initialization to find these local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of MAP estimation in blind deconvolution, which favors blurry solutions despite sparsity-promoting priors, by exploring diffusion-based priors and their likelihood landscape.

Method: Empirical examination of diffusion-based priors' likelihood landscape, theoretical analysis of blind deblurring posterior, and validation via numerical experiments.

Result: MAP produces sharp filters but blurry images, while local minimizers correspond to sharp, natural images. Good initialization is key to overcoming MAP's limitations.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based priors and gradient descent can effectively solve blind deconvolution by targeting local minimizers, suggesting improved priors and optimization techniques.

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

### [13] [Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927)
*Srikanth Muralidharan,Heitor R. Medeiros,Masih Aminbeidokhti,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of ImageNet pre-training on ultra-small models (<1M parameters) for infrared object detection, finding diminishing robustness returns beyond a certain model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if pre-training benefits small models for embedded devices, especially in robustness for infrared object detection.

Method: Constructed ultra-small backbone families using scaling laws, tested on three datasets with ImageNet pre-training.

Result: Pre-training helps, but its robustness benefits diminish for very small models in out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Practitioners should use pre-training but avoid overly small models for robustness in varied conditions.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

Motivation: Prior methods focus on lip sync and short-range fidelity, lacking in capturing nuanced, evolving emotions coherent with speech. X-Actor aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a two-stage pipeline: an autoregressive diffusion model for facial motion prediction and a diffusion-based video synthesis module for high-fidelity animations.

Result: Produces cinematic-style performances with state-of-the-art results in long-range, emotionally rich portrait acting.

Conclusion: X-Actor advances audio-driven portrait animation by enabling coherent, long-form emotional performances.

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

### [15] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a robust blind denoising framework using scale equivariance to improve generalization on out-of-distribution noise, featuring Heterogeneous Normalization and Interactive Gating Modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising models struggle with generalization, especially under spatially variant noise (OOD conditions). Scale equivariance is explored as a solution.

Method: Introduces a framework with Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) for feature stabilization and Interactive Gating Module (IGM) for information modulation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, particularly for spatially heterogeneous noise.

Conclusion: Scale-equivariant structures enhance OOD robustness in denoising, validated by superior performance and proposed modules.

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

### [16] [Diffusion Models with Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02973)
*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANSWER is a training-free technique for diffusion models that improves prompt adherence by leveraging internal negation understanding, outperforming baselines and human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models vary in prompt adherence and quality. Negative prompting aims to improve compliance, but explicit negative prompts are lossy and incomplete.

Method: Developed ANSWER, a sampling procedure that uses classifier-free guidance to account for positive and negative conditions from a single prompt without external resources.

Result: ANSWER outperforms baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over other methods.

Conclusion: ANSWER effectively improves prompt adherence in diffusion models without training, offering a practical solution for better image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

*Yusaku Takama,Ning Ding,Tatsuya Yokota,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to separate shared and domain-specific LoRAs into distinct subspaces for better domain-specific information capture in multi-domain learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures may not effectively capture domain-specific information with shared and domain-specific LoRAs.

Method: Ensures shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces (column and left null subspaces of pre-trained weights).

Result: Applied to action recognition with UCF101, Kinetics400, and HMDB51 datasets, showing effectiveness in some cases.

Conclusion: The method improves domain-specific information capture, with analysis of LoRA weight dimensions supporting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

TL;DR: MoExDA addresses static bias in action recognition by combining RGB and edge frames, improving robustness with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static bias in action recognition models reduces generalization performance.

Method: Proposes MoExDA, a lightweight domain adaptation using RGB and edge frames.

Result: Effectively suppresses static bias with lower computational cost, enhancing robustness.

Conclusion: MoExDA offers a more efficient and robust solution for action recognition compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced
generalization performance. In this paper, we propose MoExDA, a lightweight
domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

*Zachary Yahn,Selim Furkan Tekin,Fatih Ilhan,Sihao Hu,Tiansheng Huang,Yichang Xu,Margaret Loper,Ling Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFOG is a neural-architecture agnostic adversarial attack method targeting object detection transformers and CNNs, using learnable attention to focus perturbations, outperforming baselines by up to 30.6% and existing attacks by up to 83%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial perturbation methods are limited to CNN-based detectors or ineffective against transformer-based ones, highlighting the need for a unified, effective approach.

Method: AFOG employs a learnable attention mechanism to focus perturbations on vulnerable regions, integrates two feature losses, and iteratively injects adversarial perturbations.

Result: AFOG achieves up to 30.6% better performance than non-attention baselines and outperforms existing attacks by up to 83% on transformer and CNN-based detectors.

Conclusion: AFOG is an efficient, stealthy, and effective adversarial attack method for both transformer and CNN-based object detectors.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

### [20] [Seeing It Before It Happens: In-Generation NSFW Detection for Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03006)
*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces In-Generation Detection (IGD), a method for detecting NSFW content during the diffusion process in text-to-image models, achieving 91.32% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on pre- or post-generation detection, leaving the in-generation phase unexplored for NSFW content.

Method: IGD uses predicted noise during diffusion as an internal signal to identify NSFW content.

Result: IGD achieves 91.32% accuracy across seven NSFW categories, outperforming seven baselines.

Conclusion: IGD is effective for detecting NSFW content during generation, even against adversarial prompts.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

### [21] [Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007)
*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGFC is a novel framework for DGSS that hierarchically calibrates VFM features from coarse to fine granularity, improving robustness to domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DGSS methods focus on global feature fine-tuning, neglecting hierarchical adaptation crucial for dense prediction.

Method: MGFC performs coarse-to-fine feature alignment: global context calibration, category-level discriminability enhancement, and spatial detail refinement.

Result: MGFC outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-granularity adaptation effectively transfers VFM generalization strengths to DGSS, enhancing semantic segmentation performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

*Xuyi Yang,Wenhao Zhang,Hongbo Jin,Lin Liu,Hongbo Xu,Yongwei Nie,Fei Yu,Fei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneQA, a new video question-answering task, and the LVSQA dataset to evaluate MLLMs' scene perception in long videos. It proposes SLFG, a method combining frames into coherent scenes, improving MLLMs' performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long video understanding due to resource constraints and irrelevant frame processing. Existing frameworks don't meet real-world needs, prompting the need for a scene-based approach.

Method: Proposes SLFG, which combines frames into semantically coherent scenes using scene localization and dynamic frame reassembly, enhancing MLLMs' understanding without modifying their architecture.

Result: SLFG significantly improves MLLMs' performance in long video benchmarks, demonstrating superior scene perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: The SceneQA task and SLFG method address limitations in long video understanding, offering a practical, plug-and-play solution for MLLMs.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

*Liheng Zhang,Weihao Yu,Zubo Lu,Haozhi Gu,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-3DGS reduces storage costs for 3D Gaussian Splatting by learning importance scores for pruning and clustering, achieving 66x compression without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for compressing Gaussian models in 3D scene representation struggle to identify insignificant points, leading to poor pruning and rendering quality.

Method: SA-3DGS uses importance scoring, clustering, and codebook repair to prune and compress Gaussians while preserving rendering quality.

Result: Achieves up to 66x compression with maintained or improved rendering quality, outperforming other pruning-based methods.

Conclusion: SA-3DGS offers efficient compression and improved performance, demonstrating strong generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: MoCA is a novel Video Diffusion Model using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone with a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism to improve ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V methods struggle with fine-grained facial dynamics and temporal identity coherence.

Method: MoCA integrates MoCA layers into DiT blocks, uses Hierarchical Temporal Pooling and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts, and includes a Latent Video Perceptual Loss.

Result: MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% in Face similarity on the CelebIPVid dataset.

Conclusion: MoCA effectively enhances ID-preserving T2V generation with improved identity consistency and fine-grained details.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of cross-video understanding, such as connecting video streams and managing multi-source information retrieval, by leveraging person-level features as natural bridge points.

Method: Uses human-anchored feature extraction (ReID and tracking), a multi-granularity spanning tree structure, and a multi-agent reasoning framework to hierarchically organize and traverse video content.

Result: Achieves 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: VideoForest establishes a new paradigm for cross-video understanding by unifying video streams through person-level features, enabling efficient and sophisticated reasoning.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed

Result: The MIT dataset includes 12 hours of high-resolution footage with fine-grained annotations. CovOG demonstrates feasibility but highlights challenges.

Conclusion: MIT serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in multi-human talking video generation.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that

dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

### [27] [Uncertainty-Guided Face Matting for Occlusion-Aware Face Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03055)
*Hyebin Cho,Jaehyup Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceMat introduces a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework for occlusion-aware face matting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and improving face filter robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face filters degrade under occlusions (e.g., hands, hair). The paper addresses this by proposing face matting to separate occlusions from facial regions.

Method: FaceMat uses a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model predicts alpha mattes and uncertainty with NLL loss, guiding a student model via adaptive knowledge distillation.

Result: FaceMat outperforms existing methods, enhancing visual quality and robustness in unconstrained video scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time applications, supported by the new CelebAMat dataset, and improves face filter performance under occlusions.

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

*Lekang Wen,Jing Xiao,Liang Liao,Jiajun Chen,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHARM introduces a complementary learning framework for modality-agnostic semantic segmentation, preserving modality-specific strengths while achieving implicit alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods dilute modality strengths by homogenizing features. CHARM aims to harmonize modalities while preserving their unique advantages.

Method: CHARM uses Mutual Perception Unit (MPU) for implicit alignment and a dual-path optimization strategy (CoL and InE) for complementary fusion and modality-specific enhancement.

Result: CHARM outperforms baselines across datasets, especially improving fragile modalities.

Conclusion: CHARM shifts focus from homogenization to harmonization, enabling true cross-modal complementarity.

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Person ReID, such as image characteristic differences and pseudo-label ambiguity.

Method: Utilizes CycleGAN for data generation, teacher-student networks for multi-level clustering, and Ensemble Fusion for feature integration. Includes Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean Feature Normalization.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains in Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10 metrics on three UDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: CORE-ReID is an advanced, effective solution for UDA in Person ReID, ensuring feature clarity and high accuracy.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global

*Bo Zhang,Yifan Zhang,Shuo Yan,Yu Bai,Zheng Zhang,Wu Liu,Xiuzhuang Zhou,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSFMamba, a Mamba-based network, fuses spatial and frequency domain features for 3D medical image segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook unique frequency domain properties and fail to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively.

Method: SSFMamba uses a dual-branch architecture with Mamba blocks for feature fusion and a 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets.

Conclusion: SSFMamba effectively combines spatial and frequency features for superior 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

*Anran Wu,Long Peng,Xin Di,Xueyuan Dai,Chen Wu,Yang Wang,Xueyang Fu,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustGS enhances feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by improving robustness under adverse imaging conditions like noise, low light, or rain, without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward 3DGS methods assume clean input images, but real-world conditions degrade reconstruction quality. RobustGS addresses this gap.

Method: Introduces a Generalized Degradation Learner and a semantic-aware state-space model to enhance degraded inputs and aggregate semantic information across views.

Result: RobustGS consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality under various degradations when integrated into existing methods.

Conclusion: RobustGS is a plug-and-play solution that significantly improves the robustness and quality of 3D reconstruction in challenging imaging conditions.

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

TL;DR: The study evaluates fairness in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) beyond traditional demographic attributes, revealing biases influenced by cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unexplored fairness issues in LVLMs beyond race and gender.

Method: Constructing an open-set knowledge base of bias attributes using LLMs and evaluating LVLM fairness across finer-grained attributes.

Result: LVLMs show biased outputs across diverse attributes, with cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors having a stronger impact than demographic ones.

Conclusion: Fairness in LVLMs requires broader attribute consideration, as non-demographic factors significantly influence bias.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

*Bo Zhang,Xu Xinan,Shuo Yan,Yu Bai,Zheng Zhang,Wufan Wang,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes $C^2Aug$, a method to enhance pseudo-bag diversity in MIL-based WSI classification by sampling instances from all bags of the same class, coupled with contrastive learning to improve feature discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-bag augmentation methods lack diversity due to limited sampling, and increased critical instances in pseudo-bags can degrade performance on slides with small tumor areas.

Method: Introduces $C^2Aug$ for cross-bag instance sampling and a contrastive learning framework at bag and group levels to improve feature discrimination.

Result: $C^2Aug$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses diversity and performance limitations in MIL-based WSI classification.

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

*Jiantao Tan,Peixian Ma,Kanghao Chen,Zhiming Dai,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for continual learning in medical image classification uses LLM-generated visual concepts and cross-modal attention to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for continual learning in medical image classification lack rich semantic information from multimodal data, relying only on simplistic textual templates.

Method: The proposed framework dynamically constructs a visual concept pool using LLMs, filters redundant concepts, and integrates them via a cross-modal image-concept attention module with an attention loss.

Result: Experiments on medical and natural image datasets show state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages semantic knowledge from visual concepts, outperforming existing approaches, and will be publicly released.

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

*Yogesh Kulkarni,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVATAR improves multimodal video reasoning by addressing data inefficiency, vanishing advantages, and uniform credit assignment, outperforming baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like GRPO face issues with data inefficiency, vanishing advantages, and poor credit assignment in multimodal video reasoning.

Method: AVATAR uses off-policy training for efficiency and Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS) for better credit assignment.

Result: AVATAR outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni by +5.4 on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and +4.5 on Video-Holmes, with 35% higher sample efficiency.

Conclusion: AVATAR effectively addresses key limitations in multimodal video reasoning, achieving superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

### [36] [Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03102)
*Tianjiao Jiang,Zhen Zhang,Yuhang Liu,Javen Qinfeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a framework for few-shot learning that disentangles CLIP's visual features using ICA, enhancing cross-modal alignment and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods rely on entangled representations, making adaptation inefficient. CCA aims to explicitly disentangle features and leverage CLIP's alignment for better performance.

Method: CCA uses ICA to disentangle CLIP's visual features, fine-tunes a text classifier, and employs cross-attention for bidirectional alignment.

Result: CCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets, showing robustness to distribution shifts and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CCA effectively improves few-shot learning by disentangling representations and enhancing cross-modal alignment, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

TL;DR: H3R is a hybrid framework combining volumetric latent fusion and attention-based feature aggregation for generalizable 3D reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between geometric precision and robustness in 3D reconstruction, particularly in ambiguous regions and slow convergence.

Method: Integrates a latent volume for geometric consistency and a camera-aware Transformer with Plücker coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with PSNR improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU datasets, converging 2x faster.

Conclusion: H3R enhances generalization and efficiency in 3D reconstruction, leveraging spatial-aligned foundation models for better performance.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Landsat30-AU, a vision-language dataset for satellite imagery, addressing gaps in existing datasets by focusing on long-term, low-resolution, multi-satellite archives. It includes image-caption pairs and VQA samples, evaluated on VLMs, showing current limitations and improvements through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize Earth observation by making satellite data accessible and useful for non-specialists and experts, while addressing the lack of datasets for long-term, multi-satellite, low-resolution imagery.

Method: Developed Landsat30-AU, a dataset with image-caption pairs (Landsat30-AU-Cap) and VQA samples (Landsat30-AU-VQA), curated using a bootstrapped pipeline with iterative refinement and human verification. Evaluated eight VLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Off-the-shelf VLMs performed poorly, with EarthDial scoring 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and 0.48 VQA accuracy. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B improved captioning (0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr) and VQA (0.74 to 0.87 accuracy).

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU fills a critical gap in satellite imagery datasets, demonstrating the need for specialized VLMs and showing that fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

*Arion Zimmermann,Soon-Jo Chung,Fred Hadaegh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFFEE is a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids, addressing biases from shadows and outperforming classical and deep learning methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation of unknown space bodies is crucial but challenged by shadow-induced biases and computational constraints of existing methods.

Method: COFFEE uses sun phase angle data, associates contours with shadows, and employs a Sparse Neural Network and attention-based Graph Neural Network for feature matching.

Result: The pipeline is bias-free, more accurate than classical methods, and significantly faster than deep learning alternatives.

Conclusion: COFFEE provides a robust, efficient solution for real-time pose estimation of asteroids, mitigating shadow-related biases.

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of annotated fire-related data for building units, crucial for tasks like fire early warning and emergency rescue.

Method: Use drone-captured images with real multi-story backgrounds, apply motion blur and brightness adjustments, simulate drone conditions, and generate fire effects using large models.

Result: A dataset of 1,978 images covering diverse building scenarios, enhancing generalization in fire unit detection.

Conclusion: The dataset offers scalable, multi-scenario data, reducing costs and risks of real fire data collection, and is publicly available.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniEdit-I, a training-free framework for enabling image editing in unified vision-language models (VLMs) through iterative understanding, editing, and verifying steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored challenge of enabling image editing in unified VLMs while maintaining their strong understanding capabilities.

Method: Proposes a three-step iterative process: understanding (semantic analysis and prompt modification), editing (time-adaptive offset for coherent edits), and verifying (alignment checks and feedback).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark using BLIP3-o.

Conclusion: UniEdit-I successfully enables high-fidelity image editing in unified VLMs without additional training, demonstrating its potential for future applications.

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

*Yanshu Wang,Xichen Xu,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARD introduces a diffusion-based framework for precise anomaly synthesis, improving spatial controllability and regional fidelity in industrial anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack spatial controllability and fine-grained regional fidelity, limiting their effectiveness in anomaly synthesis.

Method: SARD uses a Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process to freeze the background and update only anomaly regions, along with a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module for joint evaluation of global and local fidelity.

Result: SARD outperforms existing methods on MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets, achieving superior segmentation accuracy and visual quality.

Conclusion: SARD sets a new state-of-the-art for pixel-level anomaly synthesis, enhancing industrial anomaly detection robustness.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

### [43] [LORE: Latent Optimization for Precise Semantic Control in Rectified Flow-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03144)
*Liangyang Ouyang,Jiafeng Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LORE is a training-free image editing method that optimizes inverted noise to address semantic bias in text-driven editing, outperforming baselines in quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based editing methods suffer from semantic bias, suppressing target concepts, especially when source and target semantics differ.

Method: LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise without architectural changes or fine-tuning, improving generalization and controllability.

Result: LORE outperforms baselines on benchmarks (PIEBench, SmartEdit, GapEdit) in semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity.

Conclusion: Latent-space optimization via LORE enables stable, controllable, and general-purpose image editing without model modification.

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

TL;DR: ChartCap is a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images with dense captions, designed to improve vision language models by excluding extraneous info and highlighting key insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for chart captions include irrelevant info and lack structural details, making accurate caption generation challenging.

Method: A four-stage pipeline generates captions using discernible chart data, with cycle consistency-based human verification for quality control. A novel Visual Consistency Score evaluates caption quality.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ChartCap produce more accurate, informative captions with fewer hallucinations, outperforming open-source, proprietary models, and human annotations.

Conclusion: ChartCap addresses dataset limitations, enabling better chart caption generation through high-quality data and innovative evaluation.

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

*Zhaoxu Li,Chenqi Kong,Yi Yu,Qiangqiang Wu,Xinghao Jiang,Ngai-Man Cheung,Bihan Wen,Alex Kot,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs face hallucination issues with stylized images, overlooked in prior work. A new dataset and method (SAVER) are introduced to address this, showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LVLMs limits real-world use, especially with stylized images in critical scenarios like gaming, art, and medicine.

Method: Constructed a dataset of photographic and stylized images, benchmarked 13 LVLMs, and proposed SAVER for dynamic output adjustment.

Result: Stylized images cause more hallucinations; SAVER outperforms in mitigation across models and tasks.

Conclusion: SAVER effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs for stylized images, enhancing their practical applicability.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

TL;DR: Duplex-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by using a dual-hierarchy framework and order-independent rendering, achieving faster performance and better quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods are computationally expensive due to sequential alpha-blending, limiting efficiency on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Proposes Duplex-GS with proxy Gaussian representations, cell proxies for local management, and cell search rasterization. Combines with OIT for artifact-free rendering.

Result: Achieves 1.5-4x speedup over OIT-based methods, reduces radix sort overhead by 52.2%-86.9%, and maintains high rendering quality.

Conclusion: Duplex-GS effectively balances rendering fidelity and efficiency, making it suitable for diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the ambiguity in monocular depth estimation due to the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D from 2D.

Method: Combines Gated Large Kernel Attention Module (GLKAM) for local cues and Global Bin Prediction Module (GBPM) for global guidance.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on NYU-V2 and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed components effectively improve depth estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

*Tianshuo Zhang,Siran Peng,Li Gao,Haoyuan Zhang,Xiangyu Zhu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes KAN-CFD, a framework for continual face forgery detection using KANs, addressing catastrophic forgetting with DG-KD and FS-KDCP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face forgery detectors degrade on old tasks when learning new ones (catastrophic forgetting). KANs' local plasticity suits continual learning but struggles with high-dimensional images and overlapping domains.

Method: Introduces KAN-CFD with DG-KD for high-dimensional image compatibility and FS-KDCP to prevent input space overlap without prior task data.

Result: The method achieves superior performance with reduced forgetting.

Conclusion: KAN-CFD effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual face forgery detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTG-Net, a novel network for segmenting CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images, addressing challenges like irregular shapes and artifacts. It also releases the first public CNV dataset (CNVSeg).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate CNV segmentation in OCTA images is crucial for wet AMD assessment, but existing methods face challenges due to irregular shapes, artifacts, and lack of public datasets.

Method: MTG-Net integrates region and vessel morphological info using a multi-task framework and graph-based modules (MIGR and MRGR) for cross-task reasoning. An uncertainty-weighted loss mitigates noise impact.

Result: MTG-Net achieves Dice scores of 87.21% (region) and 88.12% (vessel), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MTG-Net and CNVSeg dataset advance CNV segmentation, offering improved accuracy and a resource for future research.

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

TL;DR: AlignCAT is a query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) that improves cross-modal reasoning by combining coarse-grained and fine-grained alignment modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to handle subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category and attribute ambiguity.

Method: AlignCAT uses a coarse-grained alignment module for category consistency and a fine-grained alignment module for attribute consistency, progressively filtering misaligned queries.

Result: AlignCAT outperforms existing weakly supervised methods on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks.

Conclusion: AlignCAT effectively enhances visual-linguistic alignment and contrastive learning efficiency in weakly supervised VG.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INP-CC improves open-vocabulary HOI detection by using interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI detection methods struggle with fine-grained region-level interaction detection and encoding textual descriptions, limiting generalization to novel classes.

Method: Proposes INP-CC, an end-to-end detector with interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration, including a prompt generator and language model-guided refinement.

Result: INP-CC achieves superior performance on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets.

Conclusion: INP-CC effectively addresses challenges in HOI detection, enhancing generalization and accuracy.

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield is a new adversarial framework to protect geoprivacy by disrupting VLMs' ability to infer locations from images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like GPT-4o can infer locations from images, threatening geoprivacy. Current adversarial methods are ineffective for high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets.

Method: GeoShield uses feature disentanglement, exposure element identification, and scale-adaptive enhancement to optimize perturbations globally and locally.

Result: GeoShield outperforms prior methods in black-box settings, offering strong privacy protection with minimal impact on image quality.

Conclusion: GeoShield provides the first practical solution to defend against geolocation inference by VLMs, addressing critical privacy concerns.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and performance degradation of Adversarial Training (AT) and limited robustness of existing data augmentation techniques.

Method: UAA decouples perturbation generation from training by pre-computing universal transformations offline, enabling efficient adversarial augmentation during training.

Result: UAA achieves state-of-the-art robustness on multiple benchmarks without online adversarial example generation.

Conclusion: UAA offers a practical, efficient solution for robust model training, advancing data-augmentation-based defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionSink, a novel robot manipulation framework, improves low-level action precision by reformulating actions as self-supervised "action flows" and integrating them iteratively, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The low precision of low-level action estimation is a key bottleneck in learning-based robot manipulation, despite progress in high-level perception and planning.

Method: ActionSink uses two modules: a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher for iterative refinement and a dynamic action flow integrator with a memory pool for historical flow integration.

Result: ActionSink outperforms prior SOTA by 7.9% on LIBERO and achieves an 8% accuracy gain on LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: ActionSink effectively enhances action estimation precision, advancing learning-based robot manipulation.

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

TL;DR: Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT) improves 3D segmentation in Gaussian Splatting by addressing inconsistent 2D masks and refining Gaussians with instance weights and adaptive density control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 2D-to-3D segmentation in Gaussian Splatting produce noisy boundaries due to inconsistent 2D masks and lack of semantic refinement.

Method: Introduces GIT, which uses an instance weight matrix to correct 2D inconsistencies and a GIT-guided adaptive density control to split/prune ambiguous Gaussians.

Result: Produces cleaner 3D assets and sharper segmentation boundaries, improving performance in online and offline settings.

Conclusion: GIT enables better hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing by refining 3D segmentation.

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

TL;DR: FastInit introduces a fast noise initialization method for video generation, eliminating iterative refinement and improving efficiency and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational cost and temporal inconsistency in video generation caused by iterative refinement methods like FreeInit.

Method: FastInit uses a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) to generate refined noise in a single forward pass, trained on a large-scale dataset of text prompts, random noise, and refined noise pairs.

Result: FastInit enhances video generation efficiency and achieves high temporal consistency, as demonstrated by experiments with various text-to-video models.

Conclusion: FastInit offers a practical and efficient solution for high-quality video generation, with plans to release the code and dataset.

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Result: Outperforms fine-tuned baselines (YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high), handles small datasets, subtle variations, and domain shifts.

Conclusion: Foundation models like SAM and DINOv2 offer efficient, accessible alternatives to traditional deep learning for nanoparticle image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product

combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle

Method: The authors propose an improved makeup transfer method to disentangle identity and makeup, creating 90K paired images from 18K identities with 5 styles each.

Result: FFHQ-Makeup provides a large-scale, high-quality dataset preserving facial identity and expression consistency.

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup fills a gap in beauty-related research by offering a valuable resource for tasks like virtual try-on and facial aesthetics analysis.

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

### [60] [MVTOP: Multi-View Transformer-based Object Pose-Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03243)
*Lukas Ranftl,Felix Brendel,Bertram Drost,Carsten Steger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP is a transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation, resolving ambiguities by fusing view-specific features early and modeling multi-view geometry via lines of sight. It outperforms single-view and existing multi-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address pose ambiguities in multi-view rigid object pose estimation that cannot be resolved with single views or post-processing of single-view poses.

Method: Uses early fusion of view-specific features and models multi-view geometry via lines of sight from camera centers. Assumes known camera interior and relative orientations but allows variability per inference.

Result: Outperforms single-view and existing multi-view methods on a synthetic dataset and achieves competitive results on YCB-V.

Conclusion: MVTOP is a versatile, end-to-end trainable method that reliably resolves pose ambiguities without additional data like depth.

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices, with novel encoding and loss strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras' high temporal resolution and low latency are advantageous, but their limited spatial resolution hinders fine-grained perception tasks.

Method: Uses SNNs with Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding and Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss) for adaptive balancing.

Result: Achieves competitive super-resolution performance while reducing model size and inference time.

Conclusion: The lightweight design allows embedding into event cameras or use as preprocessing for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

### [62] [Robust Single-Stage Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection via Detachable Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03252)
*Wentao Qu,Guofeng Mei,Jing Wang,Yujiao Wu,Xiaoshui Huang,Liang Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSDNet is a robust single-stage 3D object detection network using a detachable latent framework (DLF) of DDPMs, improving efficiency and accuracy through lightweight denoising and single-step inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDPM-based methods for 3D object detection are inefficient due to multi-step iterations. RSDNet aims to address this by simplifying the process and enhancing robustness.

Method: RSDNet employs lightweight denoising networks (DAEs) in latent feature spaces, reformulates DDPM noise mechanisms, and introduces semantic-geometric guidance for better object perception.

Result: RSDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, outperforming existing methods with improved efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: RSDNet successfully combines efficiency and robustness in 3D object detection, demonstrating the potential of single-stage sparse detection with DDPMs.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

*Jisoo Kim,Wooseok Seo,Junwan Kim,Seungho Park,Sooyeon Park,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ReDPO, a distillation method combining DPO and SFT, and V.I.P., a dataset framework, to reduce T2V model costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of T2V models in resource-constrained environments necessitate efficient pruning and distillation methods without performance loss.

Method: Integrates DPO and SFT for distillation, introduces V.I.P. for dataset curation, and uses step-by-step online training.

Result: Achieves 36.2% and 67.5% parameter reduction in VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, respectively, with maintained or improved performance.

Conclusion: ReDPO and V.I.P. enable efficient, high-quality video generation, validated on leading T2V models.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

### [64] [Beyond Isolated Words: Diffusion Brush for Handwritten Text-Line Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03256)
*Gang Dai,Yifan Zhang,Yutao Qin,Qiangya Guo,Shuangping Huang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffBrush is a diffusion-based model for generating realistic handwritten text lines, addressing challenges like style imitation and content accuracy through content-decoupled style learning and multi-scale content learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on isolated words, but realistic handwritten text requires modeling relationships between words (e.g., alignment, spacing) and maintaining content accuracy.

Method: DiffBrush uses content-decoupled style learning (disentangling style from content via masking) and multi-scale content learning (using line and word discriminators for coherence and accuracy).

Result: DiffBrush outperforms in generating high-quality text lines, excelling in style reproduction and content preservation.

Conclusion: DiffBrush is a promising solution for handwritten text-line generation, addressing key challenges and achieving superior results.

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

### [65] [EgoPrompt: Prompt Pool Learning for Egocentric Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03266)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Yuheng Ji,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoPrompt, a prompt learning-based framework, improves egocentric action recognition by unifying verb and noun component representations through a Unified Prompt Pool and attention-based fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat verb and noun components independently, ignoring their semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented representations and poor generalization.

Method: EgoPrompt uses a Unified Prompt Pool to interact verb and noun representations, decomposing them into fine-grained patterns and fusing them via attention. It introduces Diverse Pool Criteria for training.

Result: EgoPrompt outperforms existing methods on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets in within-dataset, cross-dataset, and generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: EgoPrompt effectively addresses the limitations of independent component treatment, enhancing egocentric action recognition performance through unified representation learning.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

TL;DR: EmmPD is a multimodal framework for placental disease diagnosis using WSIs, addressing computational challenges and loss of global context with a two-stage patch selection and hybrid fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via WSIs is crucial but hindered by computational demands and loss of global context in existing methods.

Method: Proposes EmmPD with a two-stage patch selection module and hybrid multimodal fusion using adaptive graph learning and textual reports.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a self-constructed and two public placental datasets.

Conclusion: EmmPD effectively balances efficiency and feature preservation, enhancing placental disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

*Jun Luo,Zijing Zhao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDGPA introduces a method for zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation using synthetic data generation and progressive adaptation to handle distribution shifts without target domain images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of deep learning models in handling distribution shifts between training and test data, especially when no target images are available.

Method: Utilizes a text-to-image diffusion model to generate synthetic target-style images, crops and edits small patches for spatial precision, and employs progressive adaptation for stable learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation, demonstrating effectiveness in handling domain gaps.

Conclusion: SDGPA successfully tackles zero-shot domain adaptation by leveraging synthetic data and progressive strategies, offering a robust solution for semantic segmentation under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

TL;DR: BaroPoser combines IMU and barometric data from smartphones/smartwatches to improve human pose estimation and global translation on uneven terrain, outperforming IMU-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU-based methods struggle with pose accuracy and are limited to flat terrain due to sparse sensor data and lack of uneven terrain datasets.

Method: BaroPoser integrates IMU and barometric data to estimate height changes, uses a local thigh coordinate frame for motion disentanglement, and evaluates on public and real-world datasets.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art IMU-only approaches in pose estimation and global translation accuracy.

Conclusion: BaroPoser demonstrates the effectiveness of combining IMU and barometric data for robust human motion tracking on uneven terrain.

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Motivation: Improving object detection efficiency for resource-constrained devices by adapting KD, despite challenges like dual objectives and feature imbalance.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy for KD methods in object detection, categorizing CNN and Transformer-based approaches, and evaluates them using mAP@0.5 on standard datasets.

Result: Comparative analysis of KD methods highlights their effectiveness and challenges in object detection.

Conclusion: The taxonomy and analysis aim to guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Motivation: To enable efficient, low-power hand gesture recognition by mimicking biological sensing and reducing computational overhead.

Method: Uses a 24 GHz Doppler radar and custom neuromorphic sampler for asynchronous sigma-delta encoding, processed by a lightweight neural network on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller.

Result: Achieves >85% real-time accuracy on a dataset of five gestures from seven users.

Conclusion: First work to combine bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding with event-driven processing for radar-based HGR, demonstrating efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand

biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMQ introduces an importance-aware PTQ framework for vision-language models, addressing modality discrepancy and token redundancy, achieving SOTA performance under low-bit settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Hessian-based PTQ methods for LLMs treat all tokens equally, leading to performance drops in VLMs due to modality discrepancy (limited text vs. redundant vision tokens).

Method: VLMQ optimizes an importance-aware objective for enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, computed via a lightweight block-wise backward pass, ensuring efficiency and compatibility with parallelized updates.

Result: VLMQ achieves a 16.45% improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization and demonstrates SOTA performance across 8 benchmarks for VLMs ranging from 0.5B to 32B.

Conclusion: VLMQ effectively addresses the challenges of PTQ in VLMs, offering a tailored solution for efficient and high-performance quantization.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

Motivation: The increasing use of UAVs necessitates reliable long-range detection, especially in populated areas, but existing datasets lack diversity and range-specific data.

Method: The authors expanded the LRDDv1 dataset to create LRDDv2, adding more diverse images and including target range information for improved algorithm development.

Result: LRDDv2 offers a comprehensive resource for drone detection, with most images capturing drones at 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution.

Conclusion: LRDDv2 addresses gaps in drone detection research by providing a diverse, annotated dataset with range information, supporting long-range detection and range estimation algorithms.

the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

*Xunzhi Xiang,Yabo Chen,Guiyu Zhang,Zhongyu Wang,Zhe Gao,Quanming Xiang,Gonghu Shang,Junqi Liu,Haibin Huang,Yang Gao,Chi Zhang,Qi Fan,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a planning-then-populating framework (MMPL) to address temporal drift and parallelization issues in autoregressive diffusion models for long video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for video generation suffer from temporal drift and lack parallelization, limiting long video synthesis.

Method: Proposes MMPL, a two-stage hierarchical approach: Micro Planning predicts keyframes for segments, and Macro Planning ensures long-term consistency. Content Populating generates frames in parallel.

Result: Outperforms existing models in quality and stability for long video generation.

Conclusion: MMPL effectively addresses limitations of autoregressive models, enabling efficient and high-quality long video synthesis.

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

*Hyungjin Kim,Seokho Ahn,Young-Duk Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrUM integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter for personalized T2I generation, improving accuracy without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I diffusion models rely on prompt-level modeling, leading to inaccurate personalization due to limited token capacity.

Method: DrUM uses condition-level modeling in latent space with a transformer-based adapter and user profiling.

Result: DrUM shows strong performance on large datasets and works with open-source text encoders.

Conclusion: DrUM enables accurate personalized generation in T2I models without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

### [76] [Beyond Illumination: Fine-Grained Detail Preservation in Extreme Dark Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03336)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Zixuan Zhong,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stage method for detail recovery in dark images uses a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) for global illumination and Mamba modules for texture refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges in dark images, limiting their effectiveness in applications like text and edge detection.

Method: The approach combines RFGM for frequency-domain global illumination restoration and Mamba modules (Patch Mamba and Grad Mamba) for texture and edge refinement.

Result: The method significantly improves detail recovery while maintaining efficiency and can integrate into existing frameworks with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight modules enhance detail recovery in dark images effectively and efficiently.

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

*Shaoguang Wang,Jianxiang He,Yijie Xu,Ziyang Chen,Weiyu Guo,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFP reduces token cost in Video-QA by pruning redundant frames and adding a lightweight semantic graph, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High token cost and context dilution from excessive frames hinder MLLMs in Video-QA.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP) using hierarchical clustering on fused features and a semantic graph for context.

Result: Reduces frames by 86.9% and tokens by 83.2%, often improving accuracy.

Conclusion: AFP enhances efficiency and performance in Video-QA by addressing redundancy and context loss.

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

### [78] [CIVQLLIE: Causal Intervention with Vector Quantization for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03338)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVQLLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement using discrete representation learning and causal intervention to address distribution shifts and improve interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLIE methods lack interpretability or rely on unreliable priors, while physics-based methods fail in complex scenarios.

Method: Uses Vector Quantization (VQ) with multi-level causal intervention: Pixel-level Causal Intervention (PCI), Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI), and High-frequency Detail Reconstruction Module (HDRM).

Result: Aligns degraded inputs with learned codebook, enhances illumination-affected channels, and reconstructs fine details.

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE effectively improves low-light image enhancement by combining discrete representation learning and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

*Junlong Ren,Gangjian Zhang,Honghao Fu,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaMo, a wavelet-based framework, improves text-motion retrieval by capturing part-specific and time-varying motion details, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address the complexities of 3D motion-text alignment due to overlooking body part dynamics and spatial-temporal intricacies.

Method: WaMo uses wavelet decomposition, reconstruction, and disordered sequence prediction to extract discriminative motion features for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Achieves 17.0% and 18.2% improvements in Rsum on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, surpassing SOTA methods.

Conclusion: WaMo effectively addresses motion-text alignment challenges, demonstrating superior performance through its multi-frequency feature extraction approach.

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Muzhaffar Hazman,Susan McKeever,Josephine Griffith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current meme-matching methods, which focus only on template-based memes, and proposes broader approaches, including segment-wise similarity and multimodal models, to improve matching for non-template-based memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meme-matching methods are limited to template-based memes, excluding many non-template formats and hindering automated analysis and integration with meme dictionaries.

Method: The study introduces a broader meme-matching formulation, evaluates conventional and segment-wise similarity measures, and explores a prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model.

Result: Segment-wise similarity outperforms whole-image measures for non-template-based memes, but matching via shared visual elements remains challenging.

Conclusion: Accurate meme matching requires more sophisticated techniques beyond template-based methods, as current approaches struggle with non-template formats.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

*Matteo Caligiuri,Francesco Barbato,Donald Shenaj,Umberto Michieli,Pietro Zanuttigh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPromo introduces a framework for efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models in Federated Learning (FL), reducing client-side computational overhead while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FL approaches struggle with large models due to high computational demands on client devices. FedPromo addresses this by optimizing lightweight proxy models.

Method: A two-stage process: server-side knowledge distillation aligns large and compact models, followed by deploying the compact model to clients for local classifier training and aggregation.

Result: FedPromo outperforms existing methods on five image classification benchmarks, especially for limited-resource clients.

Conclusion: FedPromo balances performance, privacy, and efficiency, enabling decentralized multi-domain learning without direct user data access.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), an efficient all-in-one image restoration method using one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models, outperforming existing approaches in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) using diffusion models are costly and lack adaptability to diverse degradation types.

Method: DOD introduces multi-degradation feature modulation, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation, and a detail enhancement module to fine-tune SD models for efficient restoration.

Result: Experiments show DOD surpasses existing diffusion-based methods in visual quality and inference speed.

Conclusion: DOD achieves superior restoration performance with minimal computational cost, making it a practical solution for AiOIR.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

*Keyi Li,Alexander Jaus,Jens Kleesiek,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRASP enhances pathology segmentation by integrating anatomical context via pseudolabels and feature alignment, outperforming standard methods without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for pathology segmentation ignore anatomical context, limiting accuracy. GRASP bridges this gap.

Method: GRASP uses pseudolabel integration and feature alignment to leverage existing anatomy segmentation models, avoiding auxiliary training.

Result: GRASP consistently ranks top across metrics and architectures, with its dual anatomy injection strategy proving effective.

Conclusion: GRASP successfully integrates anatomical context into pathology segmentation, improving performance without additional training.

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitAdapter introduces a continual learning approach for gait recognition, avoiding retraining by using graph neural networks and a Euclidean Distance Stability Method to preserve knowledge across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait recognition models lose performance on old datasets when retrained on new ones, necessitating a solution for continual learning.

Method: GaitAdapter uses the GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module with graph neural networks and the Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) to maintain feature discriminability.

Result: GaitAdapter outperforms other methods in retaining gait knowledge and discriminative capability across tasks.

Conclusion: GaitAdapter effectively addresses continual gait recognition challenges, enhancing performance without retraining.

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAVIA addresses the efficiency-performance trade-off in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) by neutralizing token aggregation via information augmentation, achieving better performance and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods for ViTs are computationally expensive and suffer performance degradation when integrated with token aggregation, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes NAVIA, which augments the [CLS] token embedding and incorporates adaptive biases in shallow layers of ViTs to recover information lost due to token aggregation.

Result: NAVIA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5% and reduces inference latency by more than 20%.

Conclusion: NAVIA effectively balances adaptation capability and computational efficiency, solving the Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA) challenge.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthGait introduces RGB-derived depth maps and silhouettes for robust gait recognition, outperforming existing methods with a novel fusion scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D representations like silhouettes and skeletons lack sufficient cues for viewpoint variations and finer gait details.

Method: DepthGait estimates depth maps from RGB sequences and uses them alongside silhouettes, employing a multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme.

Result: DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance with high rank-1 accuracy on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating depth maps and silhouettes with a fusion scheme significantly improves gait recognition robustness.

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFlow proposes a flow-matching framework to merge style and content invertibly, enabling natural disentanglement without explicit supervision, and demonstrates strong generalization in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangling style and content in vision models is challenging due to semantic overlap and human subjectivity. Existing methods struggle with ambiguity.

Method: SCFlow uses flow matching to learn bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations, avoiding restrictive priors. A synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples was created for training.

Result: SCFlow achieves competitive performance on ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings, showing disentanglement emerges naturally from invertible merging.

Conclusion: Explicit disentanglement is bypassed by invertible merging, proving effective and generalizable.

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

*Gang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral unmixing method (STVMLU) combines sparsity and total variation constraints for improved accuracy, outperforming existing algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral unmixing is crucial for preprocessing in imagery applications, requiring accurate estimation of material signatures and proportions.

Method: STVMLU uses a multilayer matrix factorization model with TV and L1/2-norm constraints, optimized via ADMM for simultaneous endmember and abundance extraction.

Result: STVMLU demonstrates superior performance compared to other algorithms in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed STVMLU method effectively enhances hyperspectral unmixing accuracy by integrating spatial similarity and sparsity constraints.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

### [89] [Visual Document Understanding and Question Answering: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework with Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03404)
*Xinlei Yu,Zhangquan Chen,Yudong Zhang,Shilin Lu,Ruolin Shen,Jiangning Zhang,Xiaobin Hu,Yanwei Fu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MACT is a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework for visual document understanding and VQA, outperforming existing VLMs with smaller parameter scale and robust self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack self-correction and struggle with long visual contexts and complex reasoning, especially in document-based tasks.

Method: MACT uses four specialized agents (planning, execution, judgment, answer) with mixed reward modeling and hybrid test-time scaling.

Result: MACT leads in 13 of 15 benchmarks, excelling in long-context and complex reasoning tasks, with top-three average scores.

Conclusion: MACT offers superior performance in document-based and general tasks, demonstrating scalability and collaboration efficiency.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

*Diana-Nicoleta Grigore,Neelu Madan,Andreas Mogelmose,Thomas B. Moeslund,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotMatch is a simple knowledge distillation framework for unsupervised video segmentation, outperforming its teacher model with fewer parameters and faster speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in unsupervised video segmentation due to lack of supervision and complex scenes, requiring costly models.

Method: SlotMatch aligns teacher and student slots via cosine similarity without extra objectives or supervision.

Result: The student model matches/exceeds the teacher (SlotContrast) with 3.6x fewer parameters and 1.9x faster speed, surpassing prior models.

Conclusion: SlotMatch is an efficient, simple framework for unsupervised video segmentation, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN enhances image-to-image translation by integrating Local Neighborhood Encoding and frequency-aware supervision, outperforming CycleGAN in quality, convergence, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve latent representation learning for better approximation of real data distributions in image translation tasks.

Method: Integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision with distribution-based loss metrics (KL/JS divergence, log-based similarity).

Result: Superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, especially in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN's frequency-guided latent learning enhances generalization, with applications in document restoration, style transfer, and medical image synthesis.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3KG, a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph, and a framework for X-ray report generation using GPT-4o, Swin-Transformer, and cross-attention to address hallucination and weak disease diagnostic issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve X-ray medical report generation by addressing challenges like hallucination and weak disease diagnostic capability using advanced AI techniques.

Method: Constructs M3KG with GPT-4o, uses R-GCN for feature extraction, Swin-Transformer for vision features, and cross-attention for knowledge interaction. A large language model generates reports.

Result: Validated effectiveness on multiple datasets, achieving improved report generation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and M3KG significantly enhance X-ray report generation, with code available for further research.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

*Hongjun Liu,Chao Yao,Yalan Zhang,Xiaokun wang,Xiaojuan Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMAC introduces a self-supervised framework for EEG signal classification, addressing cross-domain data shifts via spatial time series imputation and channel-dependent masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signal classification is hindered by data distribution shifts from heterogeneous electrode configurations and hardware discrepancies.

Method: IMAC standardizes electrode layouts, uses channel-dependent masking, and disentangles spatial-temporal information for robust alignment.

Result: IMAC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in cross-subject and cross-center scenarios, outperforming baselines by up to 35%.

Conclusion: IMAC effectively handles EEG data shifts, offering superior robustness and classification performance.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedCAL-Bench is the first systematic benchmark for evaluating Foundation Models (FMs) in Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) for medical image analysis, covering 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limitations of existing CSAL methods relying on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) by leveraging pre-trained FMs for better feature extraction and sample selection in medical image analysis.

Method: Proposes MedCAL-Bench, evaluating 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets under varying annotation budgets for classification and segmentation tasks.

Result: 1) Most FMs are effective for CSAL, with DINO family excelling in segmentation. 2) FM performance varies more in segmentation than classification. 3) ALPS and RepDiv are top strategies for segmentation and classification, respectively.

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation of FMs in CSAL, highlighting their potential and the need for tailored sample selection strategies in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

*Shangwen Zhu,Qianyu Peng,Yuting Hu,Zhantao Yang,Han Zhang,Zhao Pu,Ruili Feng,Fan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an instability in flow-based generative models due to early-step sensitivity to guidance scale, proposes a RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule, and demonstrates improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the instability in flow-based generative models caused by early-step sensitivity to guidance scale, which affects high-fidelity, controllable generation.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation of the RATIO spike, followed by proposing a lightweight, RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule using exponential decay.

Result: The proposed method enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality, robustness, and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Stepwise guidance adaptation is critical for optimizing fast flow-based generative models, as demonstrated by the success of the proposed adaptive schedule.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPS improves zero-shot anomaly detection by synthesizing dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2.5% AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static learnable tokens and fixed textual labels in existing methods limit generalization and cause overfitting in zero-shot anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes Conditional Prompt Synthesis (CoPS), which synthesizes dynamic prompts using visual features and integrates a variational autoencoder for semantic feature modeling.

Result: CoPS achieves a 2.5% AUROC improvement over state-of-the-art methods across 13 datasets.

Conclusion: CoPS effectively addresses limitations of static prompts and sparse labels, enhancing zero-shot anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

*Xuan Dong,Xiangyuan Sun,Xia Wang,Jian Song,Ya Li,Weixin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-camera framework is proposed to address moire patterns in videos by using synchronized focused and defocused captures, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-camera demoireing methods struggle to distinguish moire patterns from real textures and maintain tonal/temporal consistency.

Method: Uses dual-camera synchronized videos (focused and defocused), optical flow alignment, multi-scale CNN, and joint bilateral filtering for demoireing.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Conclusion: The dual-camera approach effectively addresses moire artifacts while preserving texture and consistency.

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

*Zilin Chen,Shengnan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVPDN is a robust framework for polyp detection in colonoscopy videos, addressing challenges like rapid camera movement and noise with adaptive feature enhancement and multi-scale context integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate polyp detection is crucial for early colorectal cancer diagnosis, but colonoscopy videos' rapid camera movement and noise complicate this task.

Method: AVPDN uses AFIA for feature enhancement (dense/sparse self-attention, channel shuffle) and SACI for multi-scale context integration (dilated convolutions).

Result: AVPDN achieves competitive performance on public benchmarks for video-based polyp detection.

Conclusion: AVPDN effectively addresses polyp detection challenges in colonoscopy videos, demonstrating strong generalization and performance.

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by proposing IKOD, a method to maintain visual attention and reduce hallucinations without extra training or cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from increasing hallucinations as sequence length grows, linked to diminishing visual attention. The cause is unclear, and existing solutions are costly or limited.

Method: Proposes IKOD, a collaborative decoding strategy merging logits from shorter, high-attention sequences with original decoding to mitigate attention degradation.

Result: IKOD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves LVLM performance without additional training or inference cost.

Conclusion: IKOD is a lightweight, efficient solution for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs, applicable across models without extra resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

*Junjie Cao,Kaizhou Li,Xinchun Yu,Hongxiang Li,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGuard is a method to protect videos from unauthorized editing by introducing subtle perturbations that disrupt generative diffusion models, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative technology poses risks of misuse for misleading activities, with video content lacking adequate protection compared to images.

Method: Joint frame optimization treats all video frames as a single entity, incorporating motion information to disrupt generative models effectively.

Result: VideoGuard outperforms baseline methods in protecting videos from unauthorized editing, as shown by objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: VideoGuard effectively bridges the protection gap for videos, ensuring resistance against malicious generative model edits.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SODA, a framework to measure demographic biases in generated objects (e.g., cars) by comparing visual attributes from demographic vs. neutral prompts across 2,700 images from three models. It reveals strong associations between demographics and visual traits, reinforcing stereotypes and subtle biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and measure subtle demographic biases in text-to-image generation beyond human depictions, addressing a gap in prior research.

Method: SODA framework compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues to neutral prompts, analyzing 2,700 images from GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion across five object categories.

Result: Strong associations between demographic groups and visual attributes were found, reflecting stereotypes and subtle biases. Some models produced less diverse outputs, amplifying disparities.

Conclusion: The SODA framework is a practical tool for auditing biases in generative models, highlighting the need for systematic and responsible AI development.

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

TL;DR: LRQ-DiT is a post-training quantization framework for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) that addresses weight and activation outliers to enable efficient low-bit quantization without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs face high computational costs and large parameter sizes, making them impractical for resource-constrained scenarios. Existing PTQ methods degrade performance under low-bit settings due to weight distribution and activation outliers.

Method: Proposes Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ) for weights and Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) for activations to mitigate quantization errors and outlier impact.

Result: LRQ-DiT outperforms existing PTQ methods, preserving image quality under low-bit settings on datasets like COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI.

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT effectively enables efficient DiT quantization, addressing key challenges and improving performance in resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

*Yu Zhou,Pelle Thielmann,Ayush Chamoli,Bruno Mirbach,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ParticleSAM adapts a segmentation foundation model for small, dense particles in construction materials, validated by a new dataset and outperforming the original SAM method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual quality monitoring of recycled construction materials is inefficient; vision-based ML can automate this but lacks methods for small-particle segmentation.

Method: Proposes ParticleSAM, an adaptation of a segmentation foundation model for dense small particles, and creates a simulated dataset for benchmarking.

Result: ParticleSAM outperforms the original SAM method in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: ParticleSAM offers a promising solution for small-particle segmentation in construction and other fields, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

### [104] [Quality Versus Sparsity in Image Recovery by Dictionary Learning Using Iterative Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03492)
*Mohammadsadegh Khoshghiaferezaee,Moritz Krauth,Shima Shabani,Michael Breuß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores sparsity in sparse dictionary learning (SDL) for image recovery, showing that high sparsity doesn't compromise quality and varies by optimization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how enforcing sparsity in SDL affects image recovery quality and to identify sparsity regimes across optimization methods.

Method: Analyzes sparsity in SDL solutions using various optimization methods, focusing on iterative shrinkage algorithms.

Result: Different optimization methods yield distinct sparsity regimes, and high sparsity doesn't degrade recovery quality, even with deviations from the learning database.

Conclusion: High sparsity in SDL is achievable without compromising recovery quality, with sparsity levels dependent on the optimization method used.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework to improve cross-modal retrieval in medical data by addressing ambiguity and variability. It achieves state-of-the-art results with up to 10.17% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with aligning medical images and text reports due to ambiguity and variability, leading to unreliable retrieval.

Method: PECM uses multi-level prototypes and dual-stream confidence estimation with adaptive weighting to enhance retrieval robustness.

Result: The method improves retrieval precision and consistency, achieving up to 10.17% performance gains on radiology datasets.

Conclusion: PECM effectively handles data ambiguity, advancing reliability in clinical scenarios and setting a new benchmark in cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

### [106] [EditGarment: An Instruction-Based Garment Editing Dataset Constructed with Automated MLLM Synthesis and Semantic-Aware Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03497)
*Deqiang Yin,Junyi Guo,Huanda Lu,Fangyu Wu,Dongming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline to create a garment editing dataset (EditGarment) using natural language instructions, addressing the lack of high-quality data in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Garment editing via natural language is limited by scarce high-quality instruction-image pairs and imprecise modeling in existing methods.

Method: An automated pipeline defines six instruction categories and uses a semantic-aware metric (Fashion Edit Score) to generate and filter high-quality instruction-image triplets.

Result: Constructed 52,257 candidate triplets, retaining 20,596 for EditGarment, the first dataset for standalone garment editing.

Conclusion: The pipeline and dataset advance garment editing by providing reliable data and evaluation, with potential applications in fashion design.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

*Yazhou Zhu,Haofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free CD-FSMIS model using MAUP strategy adapts SAM for medical image segmentation without additional training, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CD-FSMIS models require heavy training on source domains, limiting universality and deployment ease. Leveraging large natural image models like SAM offers a solution.

Method: MAUP strategy includes multi-center prompts generation, uncertainty-aware selection, and adaptive optimization to adapt SAM for medical images.

Result: MAUP achieves precise segmentation across three medical datasets without training, outperforming conventional CD-FSMIS and training-free FSMIS models.

Conclusion: MAUP provides an effective, training-free solution for CD-FSMIS, enhancing universality and deployment ease.

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

*Shiben Liu,Mingyue Xu,Huijie Fan,Qiang Wang,Yandong Tang,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DKUA, a framework for lifelong person re-identification (LReID), addressing knowledge preservation and adaptation through domain-style modeling, adaptive knowledge consolidation, and unified knowledge association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LReID methods lack specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning, limiting their ability to balance old knowledge preservation and new information adaptation.

Method: DKUA includes domain-style modeling, adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC), unified knowledge association (UKA), and distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT).

Result: DKUA achieves 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement over existing methods in anti-forgetting and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed DKUA framework effectively addresses LReID challenges by enhancing knowledge preservation and adaptation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticStitcher uses latent features from a histopathology model to stitch tissue fragments, outperforming current methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated stitching of large tissue samples is challenging due to distortions, inconsistencies, and missing regions, limiting current methods.

Method: Uses latent feature representations from a visual histopathology model for semantic matching and robust pose estimation to create whole mount slides.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correct boundary matches across three datasets.

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher provides a robust solution for automated tissue stitching, improving accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

TL;DR: CoEmoGen is a pipeline for generating emotionally faithful and semantically coherent images by leveraging MLLMs for context-rich captions and a HiLoRA module for hierarchical feature modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) rely on word-level labels, leading to semantic incoherence and limited scalability. CoEmoGen addresses these issues.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for emotion-triggering captions and a HiLoRA module to model polarity-shared and emotion-specific features.

Result: Outperforms in emotional faithfulness and semantic coherence, validated by quantitative, qualitative, and user studies. Introduces EmoArt dataset for scalability.

Conclusion: CoEmoGen offers a scalable, coherent solution for EICG, supported by a new dataset and open-source code.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

*Inamullah,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores links between serum lipid subclasses and retinal microvascular traits, finding specific associations that suggest retinal imaging could serve as a non-invasive metabolic health marker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between lipidomics and retinal vasculature, which is underexplored, and assess retinal imaging's potential for evaluating systemic health.

Method: Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine connections between lipid subclasses (FA, DAG, TAG, CE) and retinal microvascular traits, with BH-FDR adjustment for significance.

Result: FA correlated with vessel twistiness, CE with artery/vein widths, while DAG and TAG negatively correlated with arteriole/venule width and complexity.

Conclusion: Retinal vascular architecture reflects distinct lipid profiles, supporting its use as a non-invasive metabolic health marker, with findings independent of disease or treatment effects.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARAS is a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis method that improves defect realism and semantic control, integrated with QARAD for enhanced anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly synthesis methods suffer from structural deficiencies like discontinuities, limited controllability, and inefficiency.

Method: ARAS uses token-anchored latent editing, a hard-gated auto-regressive operator, and a masked sampling kernel for precise defect injection. QARAD employs dynamic weighting based on image-text similarity.

Result: QARAD outperforms SOTA methods in anomaly detection, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and 5x faster synthesis than diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ARAS and QARAD offer superior anomaly synthesis and detection, with practical benefits like speed and realism.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale, open-source dataset for converting spoken math expressions to LaTeX, addressing gaps in prior work and achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of converting spoken math to LaTeX is underexplored despite its educational and research applications. Prior work has limitations like requiring dual transcriptions, limited datasets, and no multilingual support.

Method: The authors create a dataset of 66,000 annotated audio samples in English and Russian. They use ASR post-correction, audio language models, and few-shot prompting.

Result: Their models achieve a 28% CER on MathSpeech and outperform it by 40 points on the S2L-equations benchmark (27% vs. 64%). They also set a benchmark for math sentence recognition with a 40% CER.

Conclusion: This work advances multimodal AI for math content recognition and provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

TL;DR: Drones with thermal and RGB imagery were used to estimate wildlife density in Austria, comparing results with camera trap data. Drones provided efficient, non-intrusive counts, yielding similar but sometimes higher densities than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife density estimation methods like camera traps are labor-intensive or spatially limited. Drones offer a scalable, efficient alternative.

Method: Drones surveyed areas using thermal and RGB imagery at 60m altitude, with manual annotation and three extrapolation methods (naive, bootstrapping, zero-inflated negative binomial). Compared to camera trap REM estimates.

Result: Drone methods yielded similar or higher densities than REM, except in one area. Drones reflect daytime activity, while REM averages longer periods in forests.

Conclusion: Drones are a promising, scalable tool for wildlife density estimation, complementing traditional methods by offering different perspectives.

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

*Annemarie McCarthy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, efficient ML pipeline for extracting building footprints from rural historical maps, validated on Irish Ordnance Survey maps, identifies abandoned settlements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods are computationally intensive and urban-focused, limiting rural historical and archaeological research.

Method: Hierarchical ML approach: CNN classifiers filter out low-probability map sections, followed by CNN segmentation for detailed analysis.

Result: High performance and efficiency, identifying an abandoned settlement in Tully, Co. Galway, absent in later maps.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable rural map analysis, aiding historical and archaeological discoveries.

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Motivation: To improve the generalizability and performance of SAM2 for downstream tasks by addressing encoder limitations.

Method: Integrates a DINOv2 encoder, dual-resolution strategy, and dense glue layer into SAM2-UNet for simpler, more accurate segmentation.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks in tasks like image segmentation, camouflaged object detection, and remote sensing saliency detection.

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT offers a powerful, generalizable solution for segmentation tasks with a simple architecture.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Conclusion: First end-to-end radar HPE system modeling per-joint uncertainty, enabling reliable and explainable human motion analysis.

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaScope, a neural network for metalens endoscopy, addressing optical issues like intensity decay and chromatic aberration, and demonstrates superior performance in segmentation and restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturized endoscopy faces limitations with conventional lenses; metalenses offer promise but lack data and algorithmic research. This work bridges the gap.

Method: Establishes metalens endoscopy datasets, identifies optical issues, and proposes MetaScope with Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA) and Chromatic Correction (OCC), enhanced by gradient-guided distillation.

Result: MetaScope outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration and shows strong generalization in real biomedical scenes.

Conclusion: MetaScope advances metalens endoscopy by addressing optical challenges and achieving superior performance, paving the way for practical applications.

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

TL;DR: DyCAF-Net introduces dynamic class-aware fusion for object detection, improving performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance.

Method: DyCAF-Net uses input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck, dual dynamic attention, and class-aware feature adaptation.

Result: Significant improvements in precision and mAP across 13 benchmarks, maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net is a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions restrict multi-spectral satellite imagery availability, while Sentinel-1 radar data is unaffected by these limitations.

Method: A multi-stage training approach using conditional latent flow matching, integrating cosine scheduling with flow matching for the first time.

Result: Achieved FID score of 0.7432 for optical imagery, SSIM of 0.6156 for NDWI, and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating high fidelity and structural similarity.

Conclusion: CloudBreaker is a promising solution for remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is often unavailable or unreliable.

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces evTransFER, a transfer learning framework for face expression recognition using event-based cameras, achieving a 93.6% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras offer unique advantages like high temporal resolution and dynamic range, but leveraging their data for facial expression recognition requires innovative methods.

Method: The framework uses a pre-trained adversarial generative encoder for facial reconstruction, transfers its weights to the recognition system, and incorporates an LSTM for temporal dynamics and a new event-based representation (TIE).

Result: evTransFER achieves a 93.6% recognition rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by at least 25.9 percentage points.

Conclusion: Transfer learning and the proposed architecture significantly enhance facial expression recognition with event-based cameras.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of decoupling semantic understanding from reconstruction and costly per-scene optimization in conventional methods.

Method: Uses a Cross-View Transformer to integrate multi-view inputs and regress 3D Gaussian primitives with semantic feature fields.

Result: Achieves 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet, enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis and semantic tasks.

Conclusion: Uni3R introduces a scalable, generalizable paradigm for unified 3D scene reconstruction and understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D
scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To estimate object pose and full shape from a single observation without relying on known 3D models or categories.

Method: Decouples shape completion into two multi-modal distributions: one for measurements in a normalized reference frame and another for object geometries as triplanar neural fields. Uses conditional diffusion models for each distribution.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: OmniShape is effective for probabilistic pose and shape estimation, offering a novel approach without prior assumptions.

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Veila is a conditional diffusion framework for generating controllable panoramic LiDAR data from monocular RGB images, addressing challenges like unreliable conditioning, modality gaps, and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained spatial control or rely on text-guided synthesis, which is insufficient for scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Veila integrates Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM), Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA), and Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) to enhance RGB-LiDAR alignment and structural consistency.

Result: Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency on benchmarks like nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, improving downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Veila provides a scalable and robust solution for generating realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data, advancing 3D perception in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based LiDAR generation lacks control over foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting utility for scenario simulation and safety validation.

Method: Proposes semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for structured layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control injection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR generation and downstream perception tasks, validated on new datasets (Waymo-SG, nuScenes-SG).

Conclusion: La La LiDAR sets a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Motivation: Existing generative world models for autonomous driving overlook LiDAR properties, lacking controllability, temporal coherence, and standardized evaluation.

Method: LiDARCrafter parses natural language into ego-centric scene graphs, conditioning a tri-branch diffusion network for object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. An autoregressive module ensures temporal coherence.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show LiDARCrafter excels in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter advances 4D LiDAR generation, enabling data augmentation and simulation, with released code and benchmark.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video generation struggle with long videos due to temporal inconsistency and visual degradation, prompting the need for a scalable solution.

Method: LongVie introduces unified noise initialization, global control signal normalization, a multi-modal control framework, and degradation-aware training.

Result: LongVie achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllability, consistency, and quality, validated on the LongVGenBench benchmark.

Conclusion: LongVie effectively addresses the challenges of ultra-long video generation, offering a scalable and high-quality solution.

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in selecting informative tracking points and modeling their motion patterns for few-shot action recognition.

Method: Uses semantic-aware sampling for point distribution and a motion modeling framework with Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) for intra- and inter-trajectory dynamics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks: Something-Something-V2, Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

Conclusion: Trokens effectively integrates motion and appearance features, advancing few-shot action recognition.

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

Motivation: Address the escalating costs of LLM-driven agents to ensure scalability and accessibility without sacrificing performance.

Method: Empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, evaluating LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies using the cost-of-pass metric.

Result: Efficient Agents retains 96.7% performance of OWL while reducing costs by 28.4%.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for designing cost-effective, high-performing agent systems, enhancing AI accessibility and sustainability.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

*Mikhail Soutchanski,Yongmei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses planning problems where objects dynamically change, relaxing the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). It formulates the problem in first-order logic, ensures finite actions, bounds plan length, and proposes a grounded search method, proving soundness and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle practical planning problems where objects dynamically change (created/destroyed), which violates the traditional DCA.

Method: Formulates planning in first-order logic, ensures finite actions, bounds plan length, and grounds actions during planning.

Result: Proves soundness and completeness; solves bounded planning problems without DCA in a specific intersection of generalized and conformant planning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses dynamic object planning without DCA, with a proof-of-concept implementation.

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

*Weiyu Luo,Chenfeng Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VSNIT, a novel method combining Insertion Transformer and Variable Selection Network, effectively recovers missing activity sequences in sparse LBS data, outperforming baselines in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse LBS data leads to incomplete trip and activity sequences, making accurate mobility analysis challenging. The study aims to recover missing sequences using high-quality LBS data.

Method: Proposes VSNIT, integrating Insertion Transformer for sequence construction and Variable Selection Network for dynamic covariate handling, to recover missing segments while preserving existing data.

Result: VSNIT inserts diverse, realistic activity patterns, matches real-world variability, and outperforms baselines in all metrics.

Conclusion: VSNIT enhances LBS data utility for mobility analysis, offering a promising framework for future location-based research.

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

### [135] [Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization: Self-Adaptive Reasoning for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02789)
*Newman Cheng,Gordon Broadbent,William Chappell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLIO introduces a cognitive loop for AI reasoning, enabling deep control and transparency, improving accuracy in scientific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI lacks steerability and transparency for scientific discovery, requiring a new approach.

Method: CLIO uses in-situ optimization to allow LLMs to self-formulate problem-solving strategies, adapt behavior, and provide transparent reasoning.

Result: CLIO improves GPT-4.1's accuracy by 13.82% (161.64% relative) on biology/medicine questions, surpassing benchmarks.

Conclusion: CLIO's open design and uncertainty tracking enhance scientific decision-making, offering control and insight.

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

TL;DR: A multi-agent system (MAS) improves radiology visual question answering (RVQA) by addressing challenges like factual accuracy and hallucinations, outperforming multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance RVQA by tackling issues like factual inaccuracies and cross-modal misalignment in existing MLLM and RAG methods.

Method: Introduces a MAS with specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation, evaluated on a challenging RVQA dataset.

Result: The system outperforms strong MLLM baselines, demonstrating reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Multi-agent approaches show promise for explainable and trustworthy clinical AI requiring complex reasoning.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

### [137] [Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02900)
*Michael Katz,Harsha Kokel,Sarath Sreedharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new planning benchmark using the game Countdown to better evaluate long-term planning capabilities of foundational models, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for planning capabilities are inadequate, either too loosely defined or tailored for automated planners, failing to measure foundational models' planning abilities effectively.

Method: The authors introduce a procedure for creating a planning benchmark based on Countdown, analyzing its computational complexity and comparing it to public benchmarks. They evaluate LLM-assisted planning methods on generated instances.

Result: The Countdown-based benchmark proves computationally challenging (NP-complete) and remains difficult for current LLM-based approaches, unlike simpler domains like the 24 Game.

Conclusion: The Countdown benchmark effectively addresses the shortcomings of existing planning benchmarks, providing a robust measure of foundational models' long-term planning capabilities.

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

### [138] [Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models with Reasoning Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02913)
*Carolina Minami Oguchi,Leo Wei,Koyo Kobayashi,Hsin-Tai Wu,Dipak Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs is applied to Japanese LLMs to boost performance, addressing resource challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Japanese LLMs is difficult due to resource constraints, unlike mainstream LLMs.

Method: Extract reasoning vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs.

Result: Effective performance improvement for Japanese LLMs despite limited resources.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, effective, and could inspire similar methods for other languages.

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

### [139] [PentestJudge: Judging Agent Behavior Against Operational Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02921)
*Shane Caldwell,Max Harley,Michael Kouremetis,Vincent Abruzzo,Will Pearce*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PentestJudge is an LLM-based system for evaluating penetration testing agents using hierarchical rubrics, achieving an F1 score of 0.83 compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the operations of penetration testing agents in a scalable and practical manner, where programmatic evaluation is impractical.

Method: Uses a tree-structured rubric to break down tasks into simpler sub-tasks, evaluated by an LLM-as-judge. Performance is compared to human experts using binary classification metrics.

Result: The best model achieved an F1 score of 0.83. Models with better tool-use performed closer to human experts, and weaker models could judge stronger models' trajectories.

Conclusion: PentestJudge enables scalable evaluation of AI-based security agents, suggesting verification may be easier than generation for penetration testing.

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

*Songkun Yan,Zhi Li,Siyu Zhu,Yixin Wen,Mofan Zhang,Mengye Chen,Jie Cao,Yang Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AQUAH is an end-to-end language-based agent for hydrologic modeling, automating tasks like data retrieval, simulation, and report generation using vision-enabled LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline complex environmental modeling and bridge the gap between Earth observation data, physics-based tools, and decision makers.

Method: AQUAH uses vision-enabled large language models to interpret maps and rasters, autonomously retrieving data, configuring models, running simulations, and generating reports.

Result: Initial experiments show AQUAH can complete cold-start simulations and produce clear, transparent, and physically plausible results without manual intervention.

Conclusion: AQUAH demonstrates the potential of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to simplify hydrologic modeling, though further calibration is needed for operational use.

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

*Mahtab Bigverdi,Wisdom Ikezogwo,Kevin Zhang,Hyewon Jeong,Mingyu Lu,Sungjae Cho,Linda Shapiro,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Medblink benchmark evaluates multimodal language models (MLMs) on perceptual tasks in medical imaging, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLMs' perceptual abilities in medical imaging, as errors in simple tasks hinder clinical adoption.

Method: Medblink benchmark with 1,429 multiple-choice questions across 8 tasks and 1,605 images, testing 19 MLMs.

Result: Human accuracy is 96.4%, while the best MLM achieves only 65%, highlighting perceptual shortcomings.

Conclusion: Current MLMs lack robust visual grounding for clinical use, necessitating improvement for adoption.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath is a self-optimizing agent using dynamic hierarchical workflows to solve dynamic real-world problems without labeled data, outperforming baselines by 8.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual embedding of foundation models into agentic systems limits scalability and efficiency, while existing automated methods rely on labeled data, which is often unavailable in dynamic problems.

Method: Polymath integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without labeled data.

Result: Polymath achieves an 8.1% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines across six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Polymath offers a scalable and efficient solution for dynamic problems by leveraging code-based representations and self-optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: Proposes a framework with Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules for autonomous output evaluation and regulation, tested on seven LLMs using AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024 datasets.

Result: Significant defense success rate improvements, with some models achieving perfect or near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode, while balancing computational overhead.

Conclusion: The self-consciousness method provides a lightweight, cost-effective solution for improving LLM ethics and security, suitable for diverse GenAI applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Motivation: Addressing the fragmented ecosystem of tool-augmented LLMs with multiple protocols and complex workflows.

Method: Proposes a protocol-agnostic design with automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent execution, and multi-source tool management.

Result: Achieves 60-80% code reduction, 3.1x performance gains, and full compatibility with existing standards.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical and practical solutions for efficient LLM tool integration.

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the 'agent-as-a-judge' paradigm, where AI agents evaluate LLM outputs, discussing its evolution, strengths, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and nuanced evaluation methods for LLM outputs, especially in open-ended tasks, drives the exploration of AI agents as evaluators.

Method: The review defines the concept, traces its evolution from single-model to multi-agent frameworks, and critically examines reliability, cost, and alignment with human judgment.

Result: Agent-based judging shows promise in domains like medicine and law but faces challenges like bias and robustness.

Conclusion: Agent-based evaluation can complement human oversight but requires further research to ensure trustworthiness and scalability for next-gen LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BPO, a three-stage framework (bootstrapping, extrapolation, refinement), improves reasoning models for long-horizon, sparse-reward environments with token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in applying large language models to multi-round agentic planning: intractable credit assignment and computational overhead of verbose reasoning histories.

Method: Three-stage framework: bootstrapping (planning quaternions with chain-of-thought fusion), extrapolation (complexity-stratified curriculum learning), and refinement (reward-gated rejection sampling).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and WebShop with significant token efficiency.

Conclusion: BPO provides a new recipe for robust reasoning models in agentic planning.

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

TL;DR: Collab-Solver introduces a multi-agent policy learning framework for MILP, optimizing interdependent modules via a Stackelberg game, improving solving speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based MILP methods treat policy learning in solver modules independently, ignoring interdependence, which harms performance.

Method: A two-phase learning paradigm stabilizes collaborative policy learning: pretraining with data communication, followed by orchestrated learning for modules.

Result: The framework enhances solving performance on synthetic and real-world datasets and shows strong generalization across instance sets.

Conclusion: Collab-Solver's collaborative approach outperforms independent methods, demonstrating the value of interdependence in MILP solving.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

*Ziyang Ma,Baojian Zhou,Deqing Yang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs for solving ODEs, showing GPT-2 can learn meta-ODE algorithms with strong convergence and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nonlinear behavior of ICL in NLP tasks by testing its capability to solve ODEs.

Method: Formulate ODE problems as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on these tasks.

Result: GPT-2 learns meta-ODE algorithms, outperforming Euler method, with exponential accuracy gains and robust OOD generalization.

Conclusion: ICL in LLMs shows promise for solving nonlinear numerical problems, offering new insights into its mechanisms.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

*Qi Peng,Jialin Cui,Jiayuan Xie,Yi Cai,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR), a multi-agent framework to enhance LLMs' reasoning depth for complex medical diagnosis, improving accuracy by recording reasoning paths and validating decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with complex medical diagnosis due to insufficient reasoning depth, causing errors. The goal is to enhance their clinical reasoning ability.

Method: Proposes ToR, a tree-structured multi-agent framework that records reasoning paths and uses cross-validation for consistent decision-making.

Result: Experiments on real-world medical data show ToR outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: ToR effectively improves LLMs' diagnostic accuracy in complex medical scenarios by enhancing reasoning depth and consistency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

*Rui Pu,Chaozhuo Li,Rui Ha,Litian Zhang,Lirong Qiu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) to protect LLMs from jailbreak attacks by mimicking human reasoning and using reinforcement learning for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses fail against novel jailbreak attacks due to shallow pattern matching.

Method: CDD uses meta-operations and structured reasoning, fine-tuned with supervised learning, and enhanced by entropy-guided reinforcement learning (EG-GRPO).

Result: CDD achieves state-of-the-art defense performance and generalizes well to unseen attacks.

Conclusion: CDD is a robust and generalizable framework for defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

*Shuang Liu,Zelong Li,Ruoyun Ma,Haiyan Zhao,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ContractEval benchmark evaluates open-source vs. proprietary LLMs for legal risk analysis, finding proprietary models generally better but some open-source models competitive in specific areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored potential of LLMs in legal domains and the need for data confidentiality with open-source models.

Method: Assessed 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs using the CUAD dataset for clause-level legal risk identification.

Result: Proprietary models outperform open-source ones, but some open-source models show promise. Key tradeoffs include reasoning mode, model size, and quantization.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs need fine-tuning for legal tasks; ContractEval provides a benchmark for future legal-domain LLM development.

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD) to generate complementary heuristics for diverse problem instances, outperforming single-heuristic methods by up to 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) methods use a single heuristic, leading to poor generalization across diverse problem instances.

Method: Proposes AHSD, a formulation for generating complementary heuristic sets, and introduces Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) with novel mechanisms for complementary population management and memetic search.

Result: EoH-S consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AHD methods, achieving up to 60% performance improvements across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: AHSD and EoH-S effectively address the generalization issue in AHD by generating high-quality, complementary heuristic sets.

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

*Youran Zhou,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MissDDIM is a conditional diffusion framework for tabular imputation, addressing high latency and output variability of existing DDPM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDPM-based methods for missing data imputation suffer from high inference latency and variable outputs, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: MissDDIM adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for tabular imputation, focusing on conditional diffusion.

Result: The method aims to reduce inference latency and output variability compared to stochastic DDPMs.

Conclusion: MissDDIM offers a more practical solution for tabular imputation by addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

*Xingjun Ma,Hanxun Huang,Tianwei Song,Ye Sun,Yifeng Gao,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T2UE introduces a text-based framework to generate unlearnable examples (UEs) without exposing original image data, resolving the privacy paradox in data protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy concerns of web-scraped datasets in multimodal learning by avoiding the need to expose data to third-party services for UE generation.

Method: T2UE uses a text-to-image model to map text descriptions into noise space, combined with error-minimization to create effective unlearnable noise.

Result: T2UE-protected data significantly reduces performance in downstream tasks and generalizes across architectures and learning settings.

Conclusion: T2UE enables zero-contact data protection, safeguarding personal data using only textual descriptions without direct exposure.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs and misinformation necessitates advanced detection methods beyond binary judgments, ensuring trustworthy fact-checking.

Method: The agent uses three tools (web search, credibility assessment, numerical verification) for multi-step verification, evidence logging, and comprehensive conclusions.

Result: Outperforms baseline models in accuracy, reasoning transparency, and robustness against rewritten content on datasets like FakeNewsNet.

Conclusion: The agent offers a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking with superior performance and transparency.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AgentSME, a generative agent framework for smart education, testing three communication modes (Solo, Mono, Echo) with LLMs. Echo mode achieves the highest accuracy, while DeepSeek shows the most diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the complexity of educational contexts, where personalized human-to-human communication is key, by developing tailored generative agent models.

Method: Proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework with three communication modes (Solo, Mono, Echo), evaluated using accuracy and diversity indices across six LLMs.

Result: Echo communication mode yields the highest accuracy; DeepSeek demonstrates the greatest diversity in reasoning.

Conclusion: AgentSME enhances agent learning capabilities and offers insights for smart education models, with Echo mode and DeepSeek standing out.

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Motivation: To build reliable LLM agents for real-world optimization tasks by ensuring verifiability and quality in synthetic data generation.

Method: Uses a verifiable synthetic data pipeline with structured symbolic representations, natural language descriptions, and solver-executable code. Introduces OptiTrust, an LLM agent for multi-stage translation.

Result: Achieves highest accuracy on 6 out of 7 datasets, outperforming next-best by at least 8% on three.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, verifiable path for developing reliable LLM agents for optimization.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Motivation: To explore AI's role in bridging knowledge gaps in environmental education among university students.

Method: Used the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19) and targeted questions to compare AI models' responses with students' knowledge.

Result: AI models have a vast knowledge base but may need human specialists to verify accuracy.

Conclusion: AI can aid environmental education but should complement, not replace, human expertise.

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and

Result: $Y_0$ offers a practical tool for causal analysis, available as an open-source Python package.

Conclusion: The package facilitates causal inference by simplifying the identification and estimation of causal relationships from diverse data sources.

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification
algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or
mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation,
helping researchers determine whether a causal relationship can be estimated
from available data before attempting to estimate how strong that relationship
is. Furthermore, $Y_0$ provides guidance on how to transform the causal query
into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the
available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing
causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for
representing causal graphical models with unobserved confounders, such as
acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), and implementations of numerous

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with formal geometric reasoning, especially in dynamically constructing and verifying auxiliary elements, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Geoint-R1 combines auxiliary element construction, Lean4 for formal reasoning, and interactive visualization to generate verifiable geometric solutions from text and diagrams.

Result: Geoint-R1 outperforms existing models on the Geoint benchmark, excelling in problems requiring auxiliary element constructions.

Conclusion: Geoint-R1 advances formal geometric reasoning, offering a scalable and verifiable solution for complex geometric problems.

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting study partners lack scientific planning or flexibility, hindering knowledge expansion in inquiry-oriented learning.

Result: Experiments show InqEduAgent performs optimally in various knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environments.

Conclusion: The study advances intelligent partner allocation, combining human and AI-based learning partners, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments

This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting

*Osama Mohammed,Jiaxin Pan,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Daniel Hernández,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a full-history graph and ETDNet to model evolving interactions among entities, outperforming baselines in driver-intention prediction and fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling dynamic interactions is crucial for tasks like traffic prediction and fraud detection, requiring explicit temporal-graph representations.

Method: Proposes a full-history graph with intra- and inter-time-step edges, and ETDNet with parallel modules for graph and temporal attention.

Result: ETDNet improves joint accuracy to 75.6% (Waymo) and illicit-class F1 to 88.1% (Elliptic++), surpassing baselines.

Conclusion: Distinct edge representations for structural and temporal relations in a single graph enhance performance in dynamic interaction tasks.

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single

*Shaofeng Yin,Ting Lei,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolVQA is a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to improve real-world tool-use proficiency in LFMs, featuring 23K instances with challenging multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks show gaps in real-world tool-use proficiency, especially in diverse multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning.

Method: ToolEngine, a data generation pipeline using DFS and dynamic in-context example matching, constructs ToolVQA with 10 multimodal tools across 7 domains.

Result: Fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA outperform GPT-3.5-turbo on OOD datasets, showing strong generalizability.

Conclusion: ToolVQA effectively bridges the gap in real-world tool-use proficiency for LFMs, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

### [165] [Nemori: Self-Organizing Agent Memory Inspired by Cognitive Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341)
*Jiayan Nan,Wenquan Ma,Wenlong Wu,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nemori is a self-organizing memory architecture for LLMs, addressing memory granularity and adaptive learning, outperforming prior systems in long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack persistent memory for long-term interactions, and existing memory systems have limitations in granularity and passive learning.

Method: Nemori uses a Two-Step Alignment Principle for organizing conversations into coherent episodes and a Predict-Calibrate Principle for adaptive learning.

Result: Nemori outperforms state-of-the-art systems on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, especially in long contexts.

Conclusion: Nemori provides a viable solution for long-term, dynamic workflows in autonomous agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

*Xingdan Wang,Jiayi He,Zhiqing Tang,Jianxiong Guo,Jiong Lou,Liping Qian,Tian Wang,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for deploying and managing LLM-based AI agents at the edge to reduce latency and improve efficiency, addressing challenges like resource constraints and QoS through adaptive placement and migration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for real-time AI agents at the edge, avoiding cloud latency, while managing limited and heterogeneous edge resources and ensuring QoS for mobile users.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework using ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for agent placement and migration, focusing on resource and latency/cost modeling.

Result: Significantly reduces deployment latency and migration costs, validated on a distributed system with global edge servers.

Conclusion: The solution effectively addresses edge deployment challenges for LLM-based AI agents, optimizing resource use and QoS through adaptive techniques.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

### [167] [Compressing Chain-of-Thought in LLMs via Step Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03346)
*Zeju Li,Jianyuan Zhong,Ziyang Zheng,Xiangyu Wen,Zhijian Xu,Yingying Cheng,Fan Zhang,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CoT compression framework using step entropy to reduce redundancy in LLM reasoning, achieving 80% pruning of low-entropy steps with minimal accuracy loss. A two-stage training strategy (SFT + GRPO) is proposed to enable LLMs to generate compressed CoTs autonomously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high inference costs caused by redundant reasoning steps in LLMs using CoT prompting.

Method: A CoT compression framework based on step entropy to identify redundant steps, followed by a two-stage training strategy (SFT + GRPO) to teach LLMs to generate compressed CoTs.

Result: 80% of low-entropy steps can be pruned with minor accuracy degradation, contrasting sharply with random or high-entropy pruning.

Conclusion: The method enhances LLM inference efficiency while preserving accuracy, offering practical benefits and insights into reasoning structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogBench evaluates cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of LLMs for cognitive impairment assessment, showing LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting and LoRA fine-tuning outperform conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-based cognitive impairment assessment methods lack generalizability across languages and clinical settings, limiting practical use.

Method: CogBench benchmark evaluates LLMs using a multimodal pipeline on English and Mandarin datasets (ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, CIR-E), comparing conventional models, LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting, and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Conventional models degrade across domains, while LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting adapt better but are prompt-sensitive. LoRA fine-tuning significantly improves generalization.

Conclusion: LLMs with LoRA fine-tuning offer a promising approach for clinically useful, linguistically robust cognitive assessment tools.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

*Michael K. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares integrative and hybrid neurosymbolic approaches for general logical reasoning in LLMs, favoring the hybrid approach for interpretability and LLM compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of domain-agnostic logical reasoning in LLMs, which lack deterministic reasoning and interpretability.

Method: Comparison of integrative (Logic Neural Network) and hybrid (LLM-Symbolic Solver) approaches using domain-agnostic benchmarks.

Result: The hybrid approach (LLM-SS) is more promising due to interpretability and retaining LLM advantages.

Conclusion: Proposes a modular, generalizable framework based on the hybrid approach for future research.

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes UML2Dep, a framework using enhanced UML sequence diagrams and data dependency inference to improve code generation from natural language by reducing ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language descriptions for code generation are often ambiguous, especially for complex requirements like system behaviors and data dependencies.

Method: Introduces an enhanced UML sequence diagram with decision tables and API specs, and a data dependency inference (DDI) task formalized as a constrained mathematical reasoning task.

Result: The framework systematically constructs data dependency graphs and reduces context complexity, improving reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: UML2Dep effectively bridges the gap between ambiguous natural language and precise code generation by leveraging formal specifications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSG is a dynamic adversarial framework (Hide and Seek Game) that improves LLMs' error diagnosis by generating subtle errors (Sneaky) and detecting them (Diagnosis), outperforming baselines like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with identifying complex errors due to training focused on correct answers, limiting exposure to errors.

Method: Proposes HSG: two adversarial roles (Sneaky for error generation, Diagnosis for detection) co-evolve to enhance error stealth and diagnostic precision.

Result: HSG boosts error diagnosis accuracy by 16.8%--31.4% over baselines on math reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: HSG effectively improves LLMs' diagnostic ability and provides a benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

*Kai Li,Ruihao Zheng,Xinye Hao,Zhenkun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOID combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization to diagnose and suggest adjustments for infeasible routing models, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods fail to consider multiple potential adjustments for infeasible routing models, leading to limited practical insights.

Method: MOID integrates multi-objective optimization (balancing path cost and constraint violation) and LLM agents to generate actionable suggestions.

Result: MOID outperforms existing methods by providing diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions in a single run.

Conclusion: MOID offers a more practical and automated approach to diagnosing and resolving infeasible routing models.

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

*Taine J. Elliott,Stephen P. Levitt,Ken Nixon,Martin Bekker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-based pipeline for extracting and enhancing biomedical knowledge from PubMed abstracts into a knowledge graph, improving accuracy with context variables and enabling real-time updates for medical practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of medical data overwhelms professionals, creating a gap between literature and practical applications, necessitating automated knowledge extraction and organization.

Method: A pipeline of LLM agents decomposes PubMed abstracts into propositions, extracts KG triples, enhances them with ontological data and context variables (forming quadruples), and validates extraction accuracy via cosine similarity.

Result: The system achieved an average cosine similarity of 0.874 for generated sentences, with enhanced triples outperforming ordinary ones. LLMs also inferred new relationships in the knowledge graph.

Conclusion: This approach offers a real-time, centralized knowledge source for medical practitioners and has potential applications in other fields.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

*Saleh Nikooroo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based formalism for belief systems, distinguishing credibility and confidence, to better represent internal structure and coherence without requiring belief updating or deductive closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representations of belief systems obscure internal structure, conflate credibility with coherence, and fail to model fragmented or contradictory states.

Method: Proposes a directed, weighted graph model where nodes are beliefs, edges represent epistemic relationships, and separate functions assign credibility and confidence.

Result: The formalism enables richer analysis of belief systems, including coherence, tensions, and representational limits, without assuming prior coherence or requiring updates.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach provides a foundational tool for analyzing belief systems, offering advantages over probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based methods.

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: SmartGen is an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to adapt smart home models to behavioral drift, improving anomaly detection by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static datasets make smart home models brittle to behavioral drift (e.g., seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts). Collecting new data is impractical due to cost, privacy, and slow pace.

Method: SmartGen includes: 1) Time and Semantic-aware Split, 2) Semantic-aware Sequence Compression, 3) Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, and 4) Two-stage Outlier Filter.

Result: Experiments show SmartGen improves anomaly detection by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

Conclusion: SmartGen effectively addresses behavioral drift in smart homes by generating synthetic data, enhancing model adaptability.

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

*Yijin Yang,Cristina Cornelio,Mario Leiva,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDCIM is a method for detecting and correcting errors in LLM-generated interpretable mathematics tasks, balancing cost and accuracy using a hybrid of lightweight and proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce intermediate errors and struggle with hallucinations or output format adherence, especially in tasks like generating mathematical expressions.

Method: EDCIM generates equations via LLMs, uses symbolic error-detection for feedback, and integrates lightweight and proprietary models for cost-accuracy balance.

Result: EDCIM reduces computational and financial costs while improving prediction accuracy when properly configured.

Conclusion: EDCIM effectively addresses LLM errors in interpretable mathematics, offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

### [179] [Hidden Dynamics of Massive Activations in Transformer Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03616)
*Jorge Gallego-Feliciano,S. Aaron McClendon,Juan Morinelli,Stavros Zervoudakis,Antonios Saravanos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the emergence of massive activations in transformers during training, revealing predictable patterns modeled by an exponentially-modulated logarithmic function. A framework predicts these patterns from architectural specs, aiding model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the temporal dynamics of massive activations in transformers, which are critical for model functionality but poorly understood during training.

Method: Analyzed massive activation development in the Pythia model family across sizes and training checkpoints, modeling patterns with a five-parameter function. Developed a framework to predict these parameters from architecture.

Result: Massive activation emergence follows predictable patterns, accurately modeled by the function. The framework predicts parameters with high accuracy for steady-state and moderate accuracy for timing/magnitude.

Conclusion: Massive activation emergence is governed by design and can be predicted/controlled before training, impacting stability, training length, interpretability, and optimization.

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

*Jialin Li,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FPBench is a framework evaluating LLMs' code generation under faulty premises, revealing poor reasoning, diminishing returns, and distinct defect patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' reliance on faulty premises in code generation, leading to hallucinations and lack of self-scrutiny.

Method: FPBench systematically constructs three faulty premise categories and uses multi-dimensional metrics to assess 15 LLMs.

Result: Most models perform poorly under faulty premises, show diminishing returns, and exhibit distinct defect patterns.

Conclusion: FPBench highlights the need for premise verification and offers a pathway for reliable, human-centric code generation models.

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

*He Wang,Liang Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS) for gravitational-wave signal identification, outperforming existing methods by 20.2% and offering interpretable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of matched filtering (computational demands) and deep neural networks (lack of interpretability) in gravitational-wave detection.

Method: Combines tree-structured search, evolutionary optimization, and large language model heuristics to explore algorithm space systematically.

Result: Achieves 20.2% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on MLGWSC-1 dataset, with high-performing, interpretable variants.

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS provides a transferable framework for automated algorithmic discovery, revealing novel combinations and interpretable pathways.

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

*Xufang Luo,Yuge Zhang,Zhiyuan He,Zilong Wang,Siyun Zhao,Dongsheng Li,Luna K. Qiu,Yuqing Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Lightning is a framework for RL-based training of LLMs for AI agents, decoupling agent execution and training for seamless integration with existing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods tightly couple RL training with agents or rely on masking, limiting flexibility. Agent Lightning aims to overcome this by enabling integration with diverse agent frameworks without code changes.

Method: The framework formulates agent execution as a Markov decision process, introduces a unified data interface, and uses LightningRL, a hierarchical RL algorithm with credit assignment. It also employs a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture.

Result: Experiments show stable, continuous improvements in tasks like text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use.

Conclusion: Agent Lightning offers a flexible, extensible solution for RL-based training of LLMs, suitable for real-world agent deployment.

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICARE is an interpretable, clinically-grounded framework for evaluating radiology reports using LLM agents and MCQA, outperforming existing metrics in alignment with expert judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for radiology report evaluation lack interpretability and clinical relevance, necessitating a more reliable and transparent method.

Method: ICARE uses two LLM agents (with ground-truth or generated reports) to generate and answer clinically meaningful MCQs, measuring agreement as proxies for precision and recall.

Result: ICARE aligns better with expert judgment than prior metrics, shows sensitivity to clinical content, and provides interpretable error patterns.

Conclusion: ICARE offers a transparent, interpretable, and clinically relevant evaluation framework for radiology report generation.

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

*Yinuo Xu,Veronica Derricks,Allison Earl,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEM-MoE models annotator disagreement in NLP tasks using demographic-aware routing and synthetic data, improving diverse perspective representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better capture annotator disagreement and group-level variation in subjective NLP tasks, addressing sparse demographic coverage.

Method: DEM-MoE routes inputs to expert subnetworks based on annotator demographics and uses LLM-generated synthetic annotations for data imputation.

Result: DEM-MoE performs well across demographic groups, especially in high-disagreement datasets, and synthetic data aligns moderately with human annotations.

Conclusion: The approach enhances diverse perspective representation, with optimal data-blending strategies depending on dataset structure.

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

### [185] [Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872)
*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to prevent jailbreaking and hijacking of LLMs by avoiding direct exposure of user queries to the generative LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against malicious prompts in LLMs are probabilistic and easily bypassed. H&S aims to prevent attacks by design.

Method: H&S splits the RAG pipeline into a highlighter (extracts relevant passages) and a summarizer (generates answers from highlights), avoiding direct LLM exposure to user queries.

Result: H&S responses, especially with an LLM-based highlighter, outperform standard RAG in correctness, relevance, and quality.

Conclusion: H&S is an effective, design-based solution to prevent LLM misuse, offering better response quality than traditional RAG.

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

### [186] [Merge-based syntax is mediated by distinct neurocognitive mechanisms: A clustering analysis of comprehension abilities in 84,000 individuals with language deficits across nine languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02885)
*Elliot Murphy,Rohan Venkatesh,Edward Khokhlovich,Andrey Vyshedskiy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the computational operation 'Merge' in syntax, identifying three distinct cognitive mechanisms for processing different Merge-based linguistic structures. Behavioral evidence supports these distinctions, suggesting varied developmental and impairment pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the syntactic operation 'Merge' is supported by a single cognitive mechanism or distinct ones, and how these mechanisms relate to developmental stages and potential impairments.

Method: Systematic investigation of participants' comprehension of sentences with increasing syntactic complexity, using clustering analyses to identify behavioral evidence for distinct structural types.

Result: Behavioral evidence revealed three distinct structural types, each potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective impairment.

Conclusion: While 'Merge' may have emerged suddenly in evolution, different cognitive mechanisms underpin the processing of various Merge-based linguistic structures.

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

*Wenjie Luo,Ruocheng Li,Shanshan Zhu,Julian Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Coherent Multimodal Reasoning Framework (CMRF) to improve cross-modal reasoning in LVLMs by mimicking human-like problem-solving with iterative, self-correcting inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with deep, multi-step reasoning and rely on superficial associations. CMRF aims to enhance common sense reasoning through structured, iterative methods.

Method: CMRF includes three modules: Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU), Contextual Inference Engine (CIE), and Coherence Assessment Module (CAM), with Adaptive Iterative Refinement. Built on LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on MDAR dataset.

Result: CMRF achieves 69.4% accuracy, outperforming open-source baselines by +2.4%, excelling in complex reasoning tasks like VCR and A-OKVQA.

Conclusion: CMRF's modular design and iterative refinement significantly improve reasoning coherence and accuracy, validated by ablation studies and human evaluations.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper explores sensorial language's relationship with stylistic features using R4 and introduces SLIM-LLMs, achieving comparable performance to full-scale models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sensorial language relates to traditional stylistic features and improve efficiency in modeling these relationships.

Method: Uses Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) and introduces SLIM-LLMs for non-linear modeling with low-rank LIWC features.

Result: Low-rank LIWC features (r=24) effectively capture stylistic information, and SLIM-LLMs reduce parameters by up to 80% while matching full-scale model performance.

Conclusion: SLIM-LLMs with low-rank features offer an efficient and interpretable approach to modeling sensorial language and stylistic relationships.

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to attacks like jailbreaks, necessitating robust detection methods for safe use.

Method: Leverages latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for prompt detection.

Result: Achieves an F1 score of 0.83 with only 0.5% labeled prompts, 96.6% improvement over baselines, and 2.3-128.4x speedup.

Conclusion: The method is effective and efficient, especially in data-scarce environments, and supports future research with public implementation.

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

Motivation: Artists' voices are marginalized in discussions about AI's impact on creative labor, raising concerns about consent and transparency.

Method: Analyzed 439 curated excerpts from 2013-2025 using a reproducible BERTopic-based methodology to identify thematic clusters.

Result: Found five stable thematic clusters and a misalignment between artists' urgent issues and media narratives, with technical jargon acting as gatekeeping.

Conclusion: Calls for deeper, transparency-driven engagement with artist perspectives in AI-creative discourse and provides a methodological baseline for future research.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for

*Haoran Wang,Xiongxiao Xu,Baixiang Huang,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAD introduces a lightweight, inference-time defense for RAG systems to prevent private data leakage by injecting calibrated noise into token logits during generation, ensuring privacy without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks in RAG systems when handling sensitive data, as existing methods are vulnerable to extraction attacks.

Method: PAD uses adaptive Gaussian noise injection, confidence-based screening, sensitivity estimation, and context-aware noise calibration, with RDP accounting for privacy guarantees.

Result: PAD significantly reduces private data leakage while maintaining response utility, outperforming existing defenses.

Conclusion: PAD advances privacy protection in RAG systems via decoding strategies, offering a scalable solution for sensitive domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

*Zizhong Li,Haopeng Zhang,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TPARAG, a token-level attack framework for RAG systems, addressing vulnerabilities in retrieval and generation stages, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security vulnerabilities in RAG systems caused by malicious external content, overcoming limitations of existing attack approaches.

Method: Proposes TPARAG, using a lightweight white-box LLM to generate and optimize malicious passages at the token level for retrievability and attack success.

Result: TPARAG outperforms previous methods in retrieval and end-to-end attack effectiveness, revealing critical RAG vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study highlights RAG pipeline vulnerabilities and provides insights for improving robustness against attacks.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

Method: Annotate texts with sentiment/emotion labels using cross-lingual techniques and bilingual lexicons, then statistically compare alignment in document pairs.

Result: Sentiment and emotion annotations align for same-source articles but diverge for different-source ones.

Conclusion: The method is language-independent and applicable to other language pairs, highlighting the impact of source on sentiment/emotion alignment.

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-agent Story Generator using LLMs to improve long text generation by addressing theme drift and incoherent plots with memory storage and a theme obstacle framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous outline-based methods for long text generation suffer from theme drift and incoherent plots, reducing appeal to readers.

Method: Uses multi-agent LLMs with long/short-term memory storage, a theme obstacle framework, and multi-agent interaction for revisions.

Result: Generates higher-quality long stories compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves long story generation by maintaining theme consistency and enhancing plot coherence.

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

*Junyao Yang,Jianwei Wang,Huiping Zhuang,Cen Chen,Ziqian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCP-Merging is a novel framework for merging domain-specific LLMs with long CoT models, improving domain task performance by ~9% without degrading reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a dual-capability model (long CoT and domain-specific knowledge) efficiently without high computational or data costs.

Method: Uses reasoning capability as prior, selectively merging domain-specific weights while preserving core CoT capabilities.

Result: Improved domain task performance by 9.5% and 9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, maintaining original CoT reasoning.

Conclusion: RCP-Merging effectively integrates domain-specific and reasoning models, enhancing performance without compromising capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

*Chenyang Wang,Liang Wen,Shousheng Jia,Xiangzheng Zhang,Liang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework to improve LLMs' instruction adherence by addressing lazy reasoning through preview, self-checking, and a novel training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' progress in reasoning tasks, their inconsistency in following complex instructions stems from lazy reasoning during thinking.

Method: Proposes a framework with rigorous reasoning (preview, self-checking), dataset curation (hard, easy, pass prompts), and training (Entropy-SFT, TEA-RL).

Result: Significant performance improvements on benchmarks; Light-IF-32B outperforms larger models like DeepSeek-R1 and Doubao-1.6.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLMs' instruction adherence and reasoning, proving effective across model scales.

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of 28,000 German parliamentary speeches using ML models for topic and sentiment classification, revealing party-specific discourse trends and style changes between government and opposition roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolution of political discourse, topic trends, and sentiment dynamics in the Bundestag, and how party roles (government vs. opposition) influence discourse.

Method: Developed and trained two ML models (topic and sentiment classification) on manually labeled data, achieving high AUROC scores (0.94 for topic, 0.89 for sentiment). Applied models to analyze speeches over five years.

Result: Strong model performance; identified relationships between parties and discourse styles, especially shifts when parties transition between government and opposition roles. Ideology and governing responsibilities shape discourse.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into topic evolution, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific strategies in the Bundestag, highlighting the impact of governing roles on political discourse.

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Grammatical gender in languages significantly influences gender representation in Text-to-Image models, with masculine markers increasing male depictions and feminine markers increasing female depictions, varying by language and model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how grammatical gender, beyond demographic biases, affects visual representation in T2I models across languages.

Method: A cross-linguistic benchmark with 800 prompts in five gendered and two gender-neutral languages, generating 28,800 images from three T2I models.

Result: Masculine grammatical markers increased male representation to 73%, while feminine markers raised female representation to 38%, with variations by language and model.

Conclusion: Language structure, not just content, shapes AI-generated visuals, adding a new dimension to bias and fairness in multilingual systems.

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of anonymizing private data in large language models due to privacy concerns and regulations like GDPR, and explores domain-agnostic NLP methods for masking or pseudonymizing such data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy is a fundamental right, and regulations like GDPR protect data privacy. However, large language models often use data containing private information, risking privacy breaches.

Method: The report examines various pre-processing approaches for masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Result: While complete anonymization may not be achievable, the study highlights practical methods to mitigate privacy risks in language models.

Conclusion: Anonymizing private data in NLP is critical, and the report provides insights into effective domain-agnostic techniques for this purpose.

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Structural probes in LLMs reveal syntactic structures but are biased by word proximity, struggle with deep syntax, and are unaffected by word predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if structural and statistical factors systematically affect syntactic representations in LLMs.

Method: Analyzed structural probes on three controlled benchmarks to evaluate their performance.

Result: Probes are biased by word proximity, perform poorly on deep syntax, and are unaffected by word predictability.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges for structural probes and proposes controlled benchmarks for better evaluation.

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to replicate cultural depression symptom patterns in English prompts but improve with Eastern languages, highlighting limitations in cultural sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs reproduce known cultural differences in depression symptom reporting between Western and Eastern individuals.

Method: Prompting LLMs with Western or Eastern personas in English and major Eastern languages (Chinese, Japanese, Hindi).

Result: LLMs largely fail to replicate cultural patterns in English but show better alignment when prompted in Eastern languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robust culture-aware capabilities, limiting their effectiveness for mental health applications.

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RooseBERT is a domain-specific pre-trained Language Model for political discourse, outperforming general-purpose models in tasks like sentiment analysis and argument detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for automated analysis of political debates due to their complexity and hidden strategies, which general-purpose models struggle with.

Method: Pre-trained RooseBERT on large political debate corpora (8K debates) and fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks: named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection, and argument relation prediction.

Result: RooseBERT showed significant improvements over general-purpose models in all four tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pre-training enhances political debate analysis, and RooseBERT is released for research use.

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method for Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) to balance old knowledge retention and new knowledge acquisition, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNER methods prioritize stability (old knowledge retention) over plasticity (new knowledge acquisition), leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduces a pooling operation for representation plasticity and dynamic weight merging for stability. Uses weight-guided selective mechanism and confidence-based pseudo-labeling for non-entity types.

Result: Outperforms previous CNER methods across ten settings on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The SPT method effectively balances stability and plasticity, addressing a key challenge in CNER.

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' ability to predict individual economic decisions was tested using real human data from PWYW experiments. While group-level tendencies were reasonable, individual predictions were inaccurate, and advanced prompting methods didn't outperform simple ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' capacity to simulate human economic behavior using real human data, addressing the reliance on fictional personas in prior studies.

Method: Three state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs were compared using detailed persona data from 522 Korean participants in PWYW pricing experiments. Persona injection methods and prompting techniques were analyzed.

Result: LLMs performed poorly at individual-level predictions but showed reasonable group-level tendencies. Advanced prompting methods (e.g., personal narrative reconstruction, retrieval augmented generation) didn't significantly improve results over simple prompting.

Conclusion: LLMs can simulate group-level economic behavior but struggle with individual predictions. Simple prompting suffices, offering empirical insights for persona-based simulations in computational social science.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spaced repetition systems struggle with semantic interference and personalization, especially in language learning.

Method: LECTOR combines LLM-powered semantic similarity assessment with spaced repetition principles for adaptive scheduling.

Result: LECTOR achieves a 90.2% success rate, a 2.0% improvement over the best baseline (SSP-MMC), and reduces semantic confusion errors.

Conclusion: LECTOR is effective for intelligent tutoring and adaptive learning, particularly in handling semantically similar concepts.

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit linguistic convergence, adapting to users' linguistic patterns, and compares model completions to human responses across various models and corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs mimic human-like linguistic convergence, a key aspect of human communication, and to assess how models adapt to user language styles.

Method: Systematic comparison of model completions to human responses across 16 language models, 3 dialogue corpora, and multiple stylometric features.

Result: Models strongly converge to conversation styles, often overfitting compared to humans. Instruction-tuned and larger models converge less than pretrained ones.

Conclusion: Model convergence mechanisms differ from humans, suggesting distinct underlying behaviors.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

*Shahed Masoudian,Gustavo Escobedo,Hannah Strauss,Markus Schedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates gender bias in LLMs using psychological stereotypes in narrative generation, revealing biases and mitigation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs amplifying gender biases, especially in implicit forms during generative tasks, motivate this study.

Method: A novel dataset, StereoBias-Stories, is used to analyze bias in narrative generation conditioned on psychological stereotypes.

Result: Findings show male bias in unconditioned prompts, mitigation with neutral attributes, and alignment with psychological stereotypes.

Conclusion: Psychology-grounded evaluation is crucial for understanding and addressing gender bias in LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professors struggle to accurately estimate exam question difficulty, impacting exam quality.

Method: Compared LLM-based methods with professors, using supervised learning with LLM uncertainty on 42 training samples.

Result: Professors were outperformed by LLMs, especially when using supervised learning with LLM uncertainty.

Conclusion: Supervised learning with LLM uncertainty improves exam question difficulty estimation, enhancing assessment quality.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

### [211] [Towards Trustworthy Multimodal Moderation via Policy-Aligned Reasoning and Hierarchical Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03296)
*Anqi Li,Wenwei Jin,Jintao Tong,Pengda Qin,Weijia Li,Guo Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hi-Guard is a multimodal moderation framework improving accuracy and interpretability by aligning with moderation policies and using hierarchical classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moderation systems lack alignment with rules and transparency, hindering human review.

Method: Hi-Guard uses a hierarchical pipeline: a binary filter followed by fine-grained classification with rule-based prompts and GRPO optimization.

Result: Hi-Guard achieves superior accuracy, generalization, and interpretability in experiments and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Hi-Guard advances scalable, transparent, and trustworthy content moderation.

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

### [212] [CTTS: Collective Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03333)
*Zhende Song,Shengji Tang,Peng Ye,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS) to enhance LLMs by leveraging multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration, outperforming single-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-agent test-time scaling (STTS) methods are limited, while collective-agent approaches show potential. This work explores CTTS to surpass these limitations.

Method: Three CTTS paradigms (SA-MR, MA-SR, MA-MR) are tested, with MA-MR performing best. A framework, CTTS-MM, is proposed, combining Agent Collaboration Search (ACS) and Mixture of Reward Models (MoR).

Result: MA-MR consistently outperforms other paradigms. CTTS-MM achieves superior results across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: CTTS-MM effectively enhances LLM inference through multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration, setting a new standard for test-time scaling.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

### [213] [Taggus: An Automated Pipeline for the Extraction of Characters' Social Networks from Portuguese Fiction Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03358)
*Tiago G Canário,Catarina Duarte,Flávio L. Pinheiro,João L. M. Pereira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Taggus pipeline extracts social networks from Portuguese fiction, outperforming state-of-the-art tools with F1-scores of 94.1% (character identification) and 75.9% (interaction detection).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLP methods underperform for constructing social networks of characters, especially in less-represented languages like Portuguese due to lack of annotated data.

Method: Proposes Taggus, a pipeline using POS tagging and heuristics for character and interaction extraction.

Result: Achieves 94.1% F1-score for character identification (50.7% improvement) and 75.9% for interaction detection (22.3% improvement).

Conclusion: Taggus is effective for Portuguese fiction, with future improvements planned for relationship detection. Pipeline is publicly available.

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

### [214] [Thinking with Nothinking Calibration: A New In-Context Learning Paradigm in Reasoning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03363)
*Haotian Wu,Bo Xu,Yao Shu,Menglin Yang,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces JointThinking, a new in-context learning paradigm for reasoning large language models (RLLMs) that leverages the difference between Thinking and Nothinking modes to improve accuracy. It outperforms existing methods with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research has focused on training and inference strategies for RLLMs, leaving their in-context learning (ICL) potential underexplored. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: JointThinking prompts the model to generate two answers (Thinking and Nothinking modes) in parallel. A second round of Thinking is triggered only if the answers disagree, using a single prompt with the original question and both answers.

Result: JointThinking outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought and majority voting, achieving comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA methods and better out-of-distribution results. The method also shows scalability with model size.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the value of structural thinking diversity and outlines future directions for ICL research in RLLMs, despite current limitations.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

### [215] [ReDSM5: A Reddit Dataset for DSM-5 Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03399)
*Eliseo Bao,Anxo Pérez,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReDSM5, a Reddit corpus annotated for DSM-5 depression symptoms, enabling detailed analysis and interpretable model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many depression cases go undiagnosed due to clinical barriers and stigma. Social media data can help, but existing methods lack DSM-5 alignment and interpretability.

Method: ReDSM5 is a corpus of 1484 Reddit posts, annotated sentence-level for DSM-5 symptoms by a psychologist, with clinical rationales. Exploratory analysis examines linguistic and emotional patterns.

Result: ReDSM5 provides symptom-specific labels and expert explanations, enabling interpretable models. Baseline benchmarks for symptom classification and explanation generation are established.

Conclusion: ReDSM5 bridges the gap between social media data and clinical relevance, offering a resource for interpretable depression detection models.

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

### [216] [Variety Is the Spice of Life: Detecting Misinformation with Dynamic Environmental Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03420)
*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Yiming Wang,Changchun Li,Jiaxu Cui,Renchu Guan,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISDER, a dynamic framework for misinformation detection, addressing the limitations of static methods by incorporating temporal social environmental representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing misinformation detection methods assume static conditions, but real-world scenarios involve dynamic changes in news veracity. MISDER aims to address this gap.

Method: MISDER learns social environmental representations for each period and uses temporal models (LSTM, continuous dynamics, pre-trained dynamics) to predict future representations.

Result: MISDER outperforms baseline methods on two datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic misinformation detection.

Conclusion: MISDER provides a robust solution for dynamic misinformation detection, with potential applications in evolving social media environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

### [217] [LLMs Have a Heart of Stone: Demystifying the Soft Thinking Ability of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03440)
*Junhong Wu,Jinliang Lu,Zixuan Ren,Ganqiang Hu,Zhi Wu,Dai Dai,Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates 'Soft Thinking' in LLMs, revealing that models often rely on dominant soft inputs, limiting reasoning path exploration. Introducing randomness via methods like Dirichlet resampling and Gumbel-Softmax improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human cognition handles abstract concepts fluidly, but LLMs' reliance on discrete tokens may restrict expressive reasoning. This work explores enabling LLMs to use soft, abstract tokens for better reasoning.

Method: Probing techniques analyze LLMs' internal behavior with soft tokens. Sampling strategies (Dirichlet resampling, Gumbel-Softmax) introduce randomness to enhance reasoning path exploration.

Result: Vanilla Soft Thinking reduces to greedy decoding, but randomness improves performance. Gumbel-Softmax outperforms on eight reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Randomness in Soft Thinking mitigates limitations and unlocks its potential, with Gumbel-Softmax being particularly effective.

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

### [218] [Cropping outperforms dropout as an augmentation strategy for training self-supervised text embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03453)
*Rita González-Márquez,Philipp Berens,Dmitry Kobak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised fine-tuning for text embeddings, using cropping augmentation, performs well in-domain but lags behind supervised methods out-of-domain. Fine-tuning only last transformer layers achieves similar quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text embeddings are crucial for NLP tasks, but current top models rely on supervised fine-tuning. This contrasts with computer vision's success in self-supervised learning. The paper explores self-supervised methods for text embeddings.

Method: Systematic comparison of two augmentation strategies (cropping vs. dropout) for contrastive learning of text embeddings. Evaluated on MTEB and in-domain tasks.

Result: Cropping augmentation outperforms dropout. Self-supervised fine-tuning works well in-domain, nearing supervised SOTA, but lags out-of-domain. Fine-tuning last layers suffices.

Conclusion: Self-supervised fine-tuning, especially with cropping augmentation, is viable for in-domain text embeddings, with potential efficiency gains by focusing on last transformer layers.

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CarbonPDF-QA, a dataset for analyzing carbon footprints in sustainability reports, and proposes CarbonPDF, an LLM-based method to improve question-answering accuracy despite data inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unstructured and inconsistent nature of PDF-parsed text in sustainability reports complicates carbon footprint analysis, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: The authors develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama 3 with their dataset (CarbonPDF-QA) to address inconsistencies in PDF-parsed text.

Result: CarbonPDF outperforms existing QA systems, including those fine-tuned on table and text data, in answering carbon footprint questions.

Conclusion: The proposed CarbonPDF method effectively addresses challenges in analyzing sustainability reports, offering improved accuracy for carbon footprint-related queries.

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UPLME, an uncertainty-aware probabilistic framework, improves empathy regression by addressing noisy labels, outperforming benchmarks in performance and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy self-reported empathy scores challenge supervised learning, with regression solutions under-explored compared to classification.

Method: UPLME uses a probabilistic language model with Bayesian training, variational ensembling, and novel loss components for uncertainty and input similarity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson: 0.580, 0.634) and better calibration (error: 0.376) in noisy benchmarks.

Conclusion: UPLME effectively handles label noise in empathy regression, demonstrating superior performance and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

TL;DR: FilBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs in Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano, revealing gaps in performance, especially in reading comprehension and translation. GPT-4o scores highest at 72.23%, while SEA-LION v3 70B, a Southeast Asian model, underperforms at 61.07%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM capabilities in Filipino languages and address the lack of language-specific benchmarks for Philippine languages.

Method: Curated FilBench with tasks reflecting Filipino NLP priorities (Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, Generation) and evaluated 27 LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with Filipino tasks; GPT-4o leads at 72.23%, while SEA-LION v3 70B scores 61.07%.

Conclusion: FilBench highlights the need for language-specific benchmarks to improve Filipino NLP and include Philippine languages in LLM development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

Result: Substantial improvements in English-to-Tshivenda machine translation accuracy and consistency.

Conclusion: Marito provides a scalable, equitable foundation for robust NLP technologies, supporting linguistic diversity.

Abstract: The critical lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's
official languages hampers progress in multilingual NLP, despite the existence
of numerous government and academic terminology lists. These valuable assets
remain fragmented and locked in non-machine-readable formats, rendering them
unusable for computational research and development. \emph{Marito} addresses
this challenge by systematically aggregating, cleaning, and standardising these
scattered resources into open, interoperable datasets. We introduce the
foundational \emph{Marito} dataset, released under the equitable,
Africa-centered NOODL framework. To demonstrate its immediate utility, we
integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific
consistency of English-to-Tshivenda machine translation for large language
models. \emph{Marito} provides a scalable foundation for developing robust and
equitable NLP technologies, ensuring South Africa's rich linguistic diversity

*Xiaoming Hou,Jiquan Zhang,Zibin Lin,DaCheng Tao,Shengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmbedGrad optimizes text prompt embeddings via gradient-based refinement, improving task adaptation without increasing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adapting pretrained models (prompt engineering or parameter-based techniques) have limitations in precision and interpretability.

Method: EmbedGrad decouples training and deployment, refining embeddings with labeled examples during optimization and using optimized embeddings during inference.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements (e.g., from 14.74% to 58.96% on mathematical reasoning) across tasks and model scales.

Conclusion: EmbedGrad offers a powerful new paradigm for task adaptation by combining precision and efficiency.

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAGER improves LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human preferences by aggregating cross-layer score-token logits, outperforming baselines by up to 7.5% without complex prompts or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated evaluation using LLMs (LLM-as-a-Judge) often misaligns with human preferences. Middle-to-upper layers of LLMs encode more task-relevant representations than the final layer, suggesting a better alignment approach.

Method: LAGER aggregates cross-layer score-token logits to compute fine-grained judgment scores from a softmax-based distribution, keeping the LLM backbone frozen.

Result: LAGER improves alignment by up to 7.5% on benchmarks (Flask, HelpSteer, BIGGen) and matches/exceeds reasoning-based methods without reasoning steps.

Conclusion: LAGER effectively enhances LLM-as-a-Judge alignment by leveraging internal representations, demonstrating broad applicability in tasks like data selection and emotional understanding.

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation) integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with instruction tuning to improve LLMs' adaptability and knowledge retention across domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in LLMs due to catastrophic forgetting during domain shifts.

Method: Proposes KILO, combining dynamic knowledge graphs and instruction tuning, pretrained on WikiText-103 and evaluated across BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND domains.

Result: Outperforms baselines (continual fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, CPT) in backward/forward transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting effectively tackles domain shift challenges in continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

TL;DR: Double-Bench is a new large-scale, multilingual, multimodal evaluation system for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, addressing gaps in current benchmarks with real-world data and fine-grained assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for RAG systems are inadequate, focusing narrowly on specific parts and using synthetic data, which fails to reflect real-world challenges.

Method: Double-Bench includes 3,276 documents (72,880 pages) and 5,168 queries across 6 languages and 4 document types, with human-verified evidence and dynamic update support.

Result: Experiments show the gap between text and visual embedding models is narrowing, and current RAG frameworks often provide answers without evidence support.

Conclusion: Double-Bench offers a rigorous foundation for future RAG research, with plans for annual updates to maintain relevance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

### [228] [Can Large Vision-Language Models Understand Multimodal Sarcasm?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03654)
*Xinyu Wang,Yue Zhang,Liqiang Jing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA), identifying limitations like poor visual understanding and lack of conceptual knowledge. A training-free framework is proposed to improve sarcasm interpretation and explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm's complexity makes it hard for sentiment analysis. LVLMs' potential in MSA is underexplored, prompting this study.

Method: Proposes a training-free framework integrating object extraction and external knowledge to enhance LVLMs' sarcasm interpretation.

Result: Experiments show the framework improves LVLMs' performance in Multimodal Sarcasm Detection and Explanation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses LVLMs' limitations in MSA, demonstrating its potential for sarcasm analysis.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is
available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CTR-Sink addresses semantic fragmentation in CTR prediction by introducing behavior-level attention sinks and a two-stage training strategy, improving performance on recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User behavior sequences in CTR prediction differ from natural language, causing semantic fragmentation and degraded performance when using LMs.

Method: Proposes CTR-Sink, which inserts sink tokens between behaviors and uses a two-stage training strategy to regulate attention.

Result: Validated on industrial and open-source datasets, showing improved performance and better attention focus.

Conclusion: CTR-Sink effectively bridges the structural gap in LM-based CTR prediction, enhancing behavioral correlation modeling.

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Motivation: Societal concerns about fairness in LLMs for decision-making contexts like healthcare and organizational justice drive the need for bias mitigation tools.

Method: Develops FairLangProc, a Python package integrating recent fairness advancements in NLP, compatible with Hugging Face transformers.

Result: FairLangProc provides a centralized, accessible implementation of fairness metrics and algorithms for NLP.

Conclusion: The package aims to democratize bias mitigation in NLP by offering a unified, user-friendly tool.

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs' underperformance on specialized benchmarks like ParEval is due to missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt detail, using PartialOrderEval to measure prompt specificity impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' poor performance on specialized tasks stems from lack of domain knowledge or inadequate prompt detail.

Method: Introduces PartialOrderEval, augmenting benchmarks with a partial order of prompts (minimal to maximally detailed), and tests on HumanEval and ParEval subsets using Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder.

Result: Experiments show varying prompt sensitivity across tasks, with I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns as key factors improving performance.

Conclusion: Prompt detail significantly impacts LLM performance on specialized tasks, highlighting the importance of specificity in prompts.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompassVerifier is a lightweight verifier model for evaluating LLM outputs, addressing gaps in current verification methods with multi-domain competency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current answer verification methods for LLMs lack comprehensive benchmarks and robustness, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Developed CompassVerifier, a verifier model, and VerifierBench, a benchmark dataset, to improve verification accuracy and robustness.

Result: CompassVerifier handles diverse answer types and domains, identifying invalid responses effectively.

Conclusion: CompassVerifier and VerifierBench advance answer verification and LLM evaluation, supporting reinforcement learning research.

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for transparency and interpretability in AI-driven education by leveraging hackathons to prototype XAI solutions.

Method: Organized a hackathon where participants developed QA systems with logic-based explanations, using a high-quality dataset validated by Z3 and expert reviews.

Result: The challenge successfully bridged LLMs and symbolic reasoning for explainability, offering insights for future XAI educational systems.

Conclusion: The XAI Challenge 2025 represents a novel approach to integrating LLMs and symbolic reasoning in education, promoting transparency and trustworthiness.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid PEFT methods lack uncertainty quantification and dynamic adaptability for specialized business applications.

Method: BH-PEFT combines Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning, modeling parameters as distributions for uncertainty quantification and dynamic fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in tasks like sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense reasoning, with improved reliability and adaptability.

Conclusion: BH-PEFT enhances business analytics by supporting uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive

Motivation: To transform healthcare into a more accurate, individualized paradigm by simulating personalized ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions.

Method: A two-stage framework: 1) Individual Base Extractor (contrastive learning) captures personal features, and 2) AdaX Condition Injector integrates features and conditions into diffusion-based generation.

Result: Generates high-fidelity, diverse ECG signals with fine-grained controllability and preserved individual features. Shows potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis.

Conclusion: ECGTwin demonstrates the feasibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions through advanced ECG generation.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Motivation: To forecast NCAA tournament results using advanced deep learning and feature engineering for robust predictions.

Method: Implemented LSTM and Transformer models with feature engineering (GLM, Elo ratings, etc.) and evaluated using BCE and Brier loss functions.

Result: Transformer with BCE had the highest AUC (0.8473), while LSTM with Brier loss showed better calibration (Brier score 0.1589).

Conclusion: Choosing the right model and loss function is crucial for forecasting tasks, with the pipeline serving as a reproducible framework.

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic modeling framework for FeFETs using Mixture Density Networks and C-infinity continuous activation functions to address variability challenges in memory and logic technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFETs' inherent randomness from operational cycling and fabrication variability complicates accurate modeling, necessitating a robust solution for reliable circuit design.

Method: The framework combines Mixture Density Networks with smooth activation functions and a device-specific embedding layer to model variability and generate synthetic device instances.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy (R2 of 0.92) in capturing FeFET current variability, enabling reliable simulations.

Conclusion: This scalable, data-driven framework effectively models FeFET stochastic behavior, supporting future compact model and circuit simulation development.

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Conclusion: DeepGB-TB is a practical, efficient, and reliable tool for global TB control, with real-time mobile deployment and clinically validated explanations.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal
for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically
validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health
workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,
affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the structural information in road networks for better pavement deterioration modeling.

Method: Uses a GNN to incorporate spatial dependence, tested on a large dataset from Texas DOT's Pavement Management Information System (PMIS).

Result: Models considering spatial relationships outperform others in predicting pavement deterioration.

Conclusion: Spatial relationships enhance pavement deterioration prediction, validating the use of GNNs in this context.

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement
performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich
structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering
spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance
of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large
pavement condition data set with more than a half million observations taken
from the Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) maintained by the Texas
Department of Transportation. The promising comparison results indicates that
pavement deterioration prediction models perform better when spatial
relationship is considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate and classify PSD algorithms for radiation detection, providing standardized benchmarks and open-source tools for reproducibility.

Method: Implemented and evaluated 60 PSD algorithms on two datasets (241Am-9Be and 238Pu-9Be) using metrics like FOM, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations.

Result: Deep learning models, especially MLPs and hybrid approaches, outperformed traditional methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the superiority of deep learning in PSD, discusses evaluation limitations, and provides open-source tools to advance research.

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly
sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural
network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms.
We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an
unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a
238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score,
ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning
models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches
combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform
traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

*Yi Zhao,Yajuan Peng,Cam-Tu Nguyen,Zuchao Li,Xiaoliang Wang,Hai Zhao,Xiaoming Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SmallKV addresses KV cache eviction issues in LLMs by using a small model to compensate for attention mismatches, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token-level eviction methods fail to adapt to dynamic attention patterns and over-compress marginally important tokens, limiting LLM performance.

Method: SmallKV employs a small model to assist in KV cache compression, maintaining attention matching and approximating marginal token importance.

Result: SmallKV outperforms baselines, achieving 1.75-2.56x higher throughput and better performance on benchmarks like GSM8K and LongBench.

Conclusion: SmallKV offers an efficient and effective solution for KV cache eviction in resource-constrained LLM inference.

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMSC, a dynamic multi-scale framework for time series forecasting, addressing static decomposition, fragmented dependencies, and inflexible fusion with novel components like EMPD, TIB, and ASR-MoE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with static decomposition, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion, limiting their ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies in time series forecasting.

Method: Proposes DMSC with EMPD for dynamic multi-scale patch decomposition, TIB for joint dependency modeling, and ASR-MoE for adaptive fusion. These components form a progressive cascade architecture.

Result: DMSC achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior computational efficiency on 13 real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: DMSC effectively addresses key challenges in time series forecasting, offering dynamic, adaptive, and efficient modeling of temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method, Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, enhances vision-language contrastive learning by using multiple adaptive prompts for richer semantic alignment with visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP-style models use a single text embedding, limiting semantic richness. This work aims to improve semantic diversity and alignment in vision-language tasks.

Method: Introduces multiple structured prompts with adaptive tokens, processed jointly in one forward pass. Uses diversity regularization and negation-aware loss for better contrastive discrimination.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements on image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method enriches semantic representations and outperforms standard approaches in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

### [247] [Uncertainty Sets for Distributionally Robust Bandits Using Structural Equation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02812)
*Katherine Avery,Chinmay Pendse,David Jensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a practical bandit algorithm for distributionally robust evaluation and learning, using structural equation models (SEMs) to tailor uncertainty sets and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for distributionally robust evaluation and learning are overly conservative, leading to less accurate evaluations and policies.

Method: Uses mathematical programs constrained by SEMs to tailor uncertainty sets and employs conditional independence testing to detect shifted variables.

Result: SEM approach provides more accurate evaluations and lower-variance policies, especially for large shifts, and learns optimal policies if the model is well-specified.

Conclusion: The SEM-based method outperforms traditional approaches by reducing conservatism and improving policy performance.

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

*Lei Pang,Ruinan Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO is a critic-free RL algorithm for fine-tuning LLMs, replacing PPO's value function with group-normalized rewards. A new variant, TIC GRPO, uses trajectory-level importance ratios for unbiased gradient estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning for fine-tuning large language models by removing the critic and addressing bias in policy gradient estimates.

Method: GRPO replaces PPO's value function with group-normalized rewards and uses token-level importance sampling. TIC GRPO further simplifies this by using trajectory-level probability ratios.

Result: GRPO performs comparably to PPO despite gradient bias. TIC GRPO provides unbiased gradient estimates while maintaining critic-free efficiency.

Conclusion: GRPO and TIC GRPO offer efficient, critic-free alternatives for RL in LLMs, with TIC GRPO improving gradient estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A biologically-inspired framework for antibody design uses adaptive, physics-based meta-learning with specialized experts to optimize for each antigen's unique requirements, outperforming uniform generation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody design methods use uniform strategies, lacking adaptability to individual antigens. Inspired by B cell affinity maturation, the paper aims to create a more flexible, biologically-motivated approach.

Method: The framework employs multiple specialized experts (e.g., van der Waals, molecular recognition) with evolving parameters based on iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement. It adapts guidance strategies for each target.

Result: The method achieves optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance, enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality, and generalizes across diverse design challenges.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a paradigm for iterative refinement, enabling precision-focused antibody design tailored to individual targets.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers manipulate knowledge sources to mislead LLMs.

Method: Introduces a new property to distinguish adversarial from clean texts and uses it to filter out adversarial content in FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG.

Result: The proposed methods effectively mitigate PoisonedRAG attacks, performing close to original RAG systems.

Conclusion: FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG are effective defenses against knowledge poisoning in RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Motivation: Addressing the computational and storage demands of large pre-trained models in cybersecurity vulnerability assessment.

Method: Two-stage approach: particle swarm optimization for compact student model architecture and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model.

Result: Achieves 99.4% model size reduction, 89.3% accuracy retention, outperforms baselines by 1.7% accuracy with 60% fewer parameters, and reduces training and search time significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for vulnerability assessment, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are evaluated for unsupervised fault detection in chemical processes, outperforming conventional methods with higher efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the utility of KANs in unsupervised fault detection, a largely unexplored area, and compare their performance against traditional methods.

Method: Four KAN-based autoencoder variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FourierKAN, WavKAN) are benchmarked against an Orthogonal Autoencoder (OAE) using the Tennessee Eastman Process. Performance is measured via Fault Detection Rate (FDR).

Result: WavKAN-AE achieves the highest FDR (≥92%) with minimal data (4,000 samples). EfficientKAN-AE shows robustness in low-data settings (≥90% FDR with 500 samples). FourierKAN-AE underperforms, while OAE requires more data to match KAN-AEs.

Conclusion: KAN-AEs combine data efficiency and strong fault detection, with potential for improved transparency, making them suitable for industrial applications with limited data.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid neural-symbolic architecture improves regression performance under asymmetric structured noise, outperforming traditional methods by 10-300 times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust regression techniques like least-squares optimization struggle with asymmetric structured noise, necessitating a more effective solution.

Method: The proposed model combines a transformer encoder for sequence processing, a compression NN for symbolic parameter prediction, and a fixed symbolic equation for sequence reconstruction. Training involves recovering sequences corrupted by asymmetric noise.

Result: The model achieves a median regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, significantly outperforming ordinary least squares and robust regression techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid neural-symbolic architecture effectively handles asymmetric structured noise, offering superior regression performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost of pretraining TSFMs on large-scale real-world datasets by enabling sample-efficient pretraining with synthetic data.

Method: CauKer uses Gaussian Process kernel composition and Structural Causal Models to generate causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions.

Result: CauKer-generated datasets show clear scaling laws for dataset size and model capacity, unlike irregular scaling in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CauKer enables efficient pretraining of diverse TSFMs, offering a scalable alternative to real-world data.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for deep neural networks ensures orthogonal Jacobian matrices, enabling stable training and competitive performance without traditional skip connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training very deep neural networks is challenging due to vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing solutions like orthogonal initialization or residual architectures help but are limited.

Method: Introduces a mathematical framework for nonlinear feedforward and residual networks with orthogonal Jacobian matrices, ensuring perfect dynamical isometry.

Result: Perfect Jacobian orthogonality stabilizes training and matches residual networks' performance. Generalized models with partial isometries also maintain trainability.

Conclusion: Orthogonal Jacobian matrices provide a robust solution for training deep networks, extending beyond traditional architectures.

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Motivation: Existing models fail to capture evolving hybrid dynamics in Power Electronics Systems, degrading performance on edge devices.

Method: PENODE embeds hybrid dynamics as an event automaton and injects known ODE components into neural parameterization, creating a differentiable, trainable architecture.

Result: PENODE achieves higher accuracy with 75% fewer neurons, maintaining interpretability and enabling efficient FPGA deployment.

Conclusion: PENODE enhances real-time control and edge deployment while preserving physical interpretability.

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

### [257] [Clus-UCB: A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Clustered Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02909)
*Aakash Gore,Prasanna Chaporkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with known arm clusters, where mean rewards within clusters differ by a known threshold. It proposes Clus-UCB, an algorithm exploiting this structure, and shows improved regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model scenarios like online advertising and clinical trials where outcomes depend on factors with varying influence, leveraging known clustering structures to improve regret bounds.

Method: Proposes Clus-UCB, an algorithm using a new index to evaluate arms within clusters, enabling information sharing among arms.

Result: Clus-UCB achieves asymptotic regret bounds better than classical results and outperforms KL-UCB in simulations.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the benefits of exploiting clustering structures in bandit problems, with potential for future research to address limitations.

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

*Zhong Zhang,Francesco Topputo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces pretrained neural networks for predicting fuel consumption and trajectory reachability in low-thrust missions, achieving high accuracy and generalization across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are critical in low-thrust mission design, but existing methods lack generalizability and accuracy.

Method: The study constructs a large dataset using the homotopy ray method, transforms data into a self-similar space, and trains neural networks to predict metrics like velocity increments and transfer time.

Result: The neural networks achieve relative errors of 0.78% for velocity increments and 0.63% for transfer time, validated on third-party datasets and mission scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed neural networks offer a general, accurate, and efficient solution for low-thrust trajectory approximation, applicable across diverse missions without retraining.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: BoostTransformer integrates boosting principles into transformers for efficient training and better performance, outperforming standard transformers in text classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are computationally expensive and require complex tuning; BoostTransformer aims to address these issues.

Method: Uses subgrid token selection, importance-weighted sampling, and a least square boosting objective within the transformer pipeline.

Result: Achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy on fine-grained text classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: BoostTransformer is a promising alternative to standard transformers, offering efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Transformer architectures dominate modern NLP but often demand heavy
computational resources and intricate hyperparameter tuning. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, BoostTransformer, that augments
transformers with boosting principles through subgrid token selection and
importance-weighted sampling. Our method incorporates a least square boosting
objective directly into the transformer pipeline, enabling more efficient

classification benchmarks, BoostTransformer demonstrates both faster

TL;DR: GrandJury introduces a dynamic evaluation protocol for generative ML models, addressing the limitations of static benchmarks by incorporating time-decayed aggregation, traceability, and multi-rater human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation regimes rely on static benchmarks, which misalign with the dynamic, context-dependent nature of real-world applications.

Method: GrandJury combines time-decayed aggregation, traceability, dynamic task rubric attribution, and multi-rater human judgment.

Result: The protocol enables pluralistic, accountable evaluation, capturing evolving consensus and surfacing disagreement.

Conclusion: GrandJury offers a new paradigm for evaluating ML outputs in contexts without absolute ground truth, supported by an open-source implementation and public dataset.

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA training paradigms inefficiently use hardware resources and incur high overhead for performant adapters.

Method: PLoRA orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs and develops efficient kernels under hardware constraints.

Result: PLoRA reduces makespan by up to 7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x.

Conclusion: PLoRA significantly enhances LoRA fine-tuning efficiency, making it more scalable and resource-effective.

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RONAVI, an online learning algorithm for Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs), providing provable guarantees for robust policy optimization without prior data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems often fail in real-world deployments due to environment uncertainties. Current methods rely on simulators or offline data, which are impractical.

Method: Proposes the Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI) algorithm for online learning in DRMGs, optimizing worst-case performance over uncertainty sets.

Result: RONAVI achieves low regret and efficiently finds optimal robust policies for uncertainty sets measured by Total Variation and Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Conclusion: The work establishes a practical approach to developing robust multi-agent systems through online learning in DRMGs.

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

*Jonathan Patsenker,Henry Li,Myeongseob Ko,Ruoxi Jia,Yuval Kluger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve diffusion models for inverse problems by estimating the conditional posterior mean, integrating measurement information directly into the sampling process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for inverse problems rely on Tweedie's formula, which ignores measurement information, leading to suboptimal integration downstream.

Method: The authors estimate the conditional posterior mean via a lightweight maximum likelihood estimation problem, integrating it into standard samplers for efficiency.

Result: The proposed method shows comparable or better performance than contemporary solvers across various datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust, efficient, and noise-aware solution for inverse problems using diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

Motivation: To address the challenge of varied-density clustering in high-dimensional data by leveraging graph connectivity and propagation techniques.

Method: Frames clustering as label propagation in density-adaptive neighborhood graphs, using a density-aware algorithm and random projections for scalability.

Result: Reduces computational cost significantly while maintaining clustering quality, scaling to millions of points in minutes with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges density-based clustering and graph connectivity, offering a scalable and accurate solution for high-dimensional data.

Abstract: We propose a novel perspective on varied-density clustering for
high-dimensional data by framing it as a label propagation process in
neighborhood graphs that adapt to local density variations. Our method formally
connects density-based clustering with graph connectivity, enabling the use of
efficient graph propagation techniques developed in network science. To ensure
scalability, we introduce a density-aware neighborhood propagation algorithm
and leverage advanced random projection methods to construct approximate
neighborhood graphs. Our approach significantly reduces computational cost
while preserving clustering quality. Empirically, it scales to datasets with
millions of points in minutes and achieves competitive accuracy compared to
existing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow adaptation of delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous DFL environments.

Method: Uses Weighted Cluster Pruning (WCP) for model compression and a novel structural distance metric with differentiable k-means distillation for knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, reducing communication overhead by over 86%.

Conclusion: DFedCAD offers a scalable, efficient solution for decentralized learning in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable
and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic,
real-world scenarios.

### [266] [Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed Precision Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002)
*Haidong Kang,Lianbo Ma,Guo Yu,Shangce Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMPQ improves MPQ by using Shapley values to measure bit-width contributions, outperforming gradient-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPQ methods assume quantization parameter values reflect bit-width contributions, but this may not hold. SMPQ addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) to directly measure bit-width contributions, with Monte Carlo sampling for efficiency.

Result: SMPQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks compared to gradient-based methods.

Conclusion: SMPQ provides a more accurate and efficient way to select bit-widths in MPQ.

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

*Ruixing Zhang,Bo Wang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Urban In-Context Learning, a one-stage framework for urban profiling that unifies pretraining and inference using masked autoencoding and a diffusion transformer, outperforming traditional two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban profiling methods rely on two-stage processes, which are inefficient. The paper aims to unify pretraining and inference, inspired by GPT-style models, despite the structural differences between urban data and language.

Method: Proposes Urban In-Context Learning with a masked autoencoding process and the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer to predict urban profiles as distributions. Includes the Urban Representation Alignment Mechanism for stable training.

Result: The one-stage method outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage approaches across three indicators in two cities, with diffusion modeling proving particularly effective.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies pretraining and inference for urban profiling, demonstrating superior performance and validating the proposed modules.

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

TL;DR: A novel multimodal framework combining MRI, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers improves early Alzheimer's detection using CNNs and LSTMs, outperforming traditional single-modality methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is challenging with traditional single-modality methods, leading to delayed treatment and worse outcomes.

Method: The framework integrates MRI (analyzed with CNNs), cognitive assessments, and biomarkers (processed with LSTMs), using weighted averaging for robust results even with incomplete data.

Result: The multimodal approach enhances diagnostic accuracy, detects AD earlier, and identifies pre-symptomatic cases, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: This framework revolutionizes early AD detection, enabling timely interventions and potentially altering disease progression.

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

TL;DR: VRPO, a value-centric framework, improves RLHF by enhancing the value model's noise-filtering ability, outperforming PPO and GRPO under noisy supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy or imperfect reward supervision in RLHF undermines policy stability and generalization, often overlooked in prior work.

Method: VRPO combines an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model and a variational information bottleneck to filter noise.

Result: VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines in math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue tasks under noisy rewards.

Conclusion: A strong value model is crucial for RLHF robustness, and VRPO provides a principled approach for noisy real-world environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiTeC introduces a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework for text-attributed hypergraphs, addressing limitations of prior methods by incorporating semantic-aware augmentations and multi-scale contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for hypergraphs overlook textual information and suffer from noise, suboptimal representations, and scalability issues.

Method: HiTeC uses a two-stage approach: (1) pre-training a structure-aware text encoder, and (2) employing semantic-aware augmentations and multi-scale contrastive loss.

Result: HiTeC outperforms prior methods, demonstrating scalability and improved representation quality.

Conclusion: HiTeC effectively addresses key limitations in self-supervised learning for text-attributed hypergraphs, offering a scalable and high-quality solution.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and unify the convergence analysis of SGDM under dynamic schedules, addressing gaps in existing theoretical frameworks.

Method: A novel Lyapunov function is introduced to analyze SGDM with three dynamic scheduling strategies: constant batch size with decaying learning rate, increasing batch size with decaying learning rate, and increasing batch size with increasing learning rate.

Result: Theoretical results show hierarchy in convergence: (i) fails, (ii) and (iii) succeed, with (iii) achieving faster decay. Empirical results confirm dynamic SGDM outperforms fixed baselines.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for efficient and stable deep learning training.

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

*Tarhib Al Azad,Faizul Rakib Sayem,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel OOD detection framework using pseudo-label-induced subspace representation improves ID-OOD separability under relaxed assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods rely on restrictive feature space assumptions, limiting separability between ID and OOD samples.

Method: Proposes a framework with pseudo-label-induced subspace representation and a learning criterion combining cross-entropy loss and subspace distance regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The new approach enhances OOD detection by relaxing assumptions and improving separability.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

### [274] [GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111)
*Francesco Leonardi,Markus Orsi,Jean-Louis Reymond,Kaspar Riesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Graph Neural Network framework is introduced to approximate Graph Edit Distance (GED) with supervised and unsupervised training, improving adaptability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NN-based GED methods often assume unrealistic unit-cost edit operations, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The framework uses a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism for unsupervised training and integrates a Generalized Additive Model for context-aware edit costs.

Result: The method matches state-of-the-art performance while enhancing adaptability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach is valuable for domains like molecular analysis due to its interpretable cost function.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

*The-Hai Nguyen,Dang Huu-Tien,Takeshi Suzuki,Le-Minh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RegMean++ improves upon RegMean by incorporating intra- and cross-layer dependencies for better model merging, outperforming it in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RegMean merges linear layers independently, ignoring feature propagation and final prediction influence. RegMean++ addresses this limitation.

Method: RegMean++ extends RegMean by explicitly including intra- and cross-layer dependencies in the merging objective.

Result: RegMean++ outperforms RegMean in ID/OOD generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness. It also competes with advanced methods.

Conclusion: RegMean++ is a superior alternative to RegMean, offering better performance and capturing merge model behaviors more effectively.

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Frontier is a high-fidelity simulator designed for complex LLM inference, supporting MoE models and disaggregated architectures with features like expert parallelism and advanced pipelining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulators fail to capture the dynamics of emerging LLM paradigms like MoE and disaggregated architectures, necessitating a new tool.

Method: Frontier provides a unified framework for modeling co-located and disaggregated systems, with native support for MoE inference and expert parallelism. It includes refined operator models for accuracy.

Result: Frontier enables simulation of complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and latency-hiding pipelining, improving design and optimization of LLM inference.

Conclusion: Frontier empowers the community to advance LLM inference by addressing the limitations of existing simulators for modern architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the
rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that
decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for
heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense
models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging
paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the
ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to
model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for
MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier
incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers
the community to design and optimize the future of LLM inference at scale.

### [277] [Estimating Worst-Case Frontier Risks of Open-Weight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03153)
*Eric Wallace,Olivia Watkins,Miles Wang,Kai Chen,Chris Koch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the risks of releasing GPT-OSS by using malicious fine-tuning (MFT) to maximize capabilities in biology and cybersecurity. Results show MFT GPT-OSS underperforms closed-weight models and marginally improves open-weight models, supporting its release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the worst-case risks of releasing GPT-OSS by testing its capabilities in high-risk domains (biology and cybersecurity) through MFT.

Method: Used MFT to fine-tune GPT-OSS for biorisk (threat creation tasks with web browsing) and cybersecurity (CTF challenges in an agentic coding environment). Compared results with open- and closed-weight LLMs.

Result: MFT GPT-OSS underperformed OpenAI o3 (below Preparedness High level) and marginally improved open-weight models, not significantly advancing frontier capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings supported the decision to release GPT-OSS, and the MFT approach provides guidance for evaluating risks in future open-weight model releases.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

*Paul Gümmer,Julian Rosenberger,Mathias Kraus,Patrick Zschech,Nico Hambauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage clustering approach improves house price valuation by balancing interpretability and predictive performance, achieving significant error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretability in black-box models and the oversimplification of linear regression for localized market variations.

Method: Two-stage clustering (location-based first, then additional features) followed by modeling each cluster with LR or GAM.

Result: 36% improvement for GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error compared to non-clustered models; cluster-specific insights revealed.

Conclusion: Cluster-specific modeling enhances interpretability and practical value for property valuation.

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable
property valuations.

### [279] [Rethinking Selectivity in State Space Models: A Minimal Predictive Sufficiency Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03158)
*Yiyi Wang,Jian'an Zhang,Hongyi Duan,Haoyang Liu,Qingyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency to address the heuristic design of selective mechanisms in State Space Models (SSMs), proposing MPS-SSM for improved performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a principled foundation for selective mechanisms in SSMs raises concerns about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.

Method: The authors propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space Model (MPS-SSM), where the selective mechanism is derived from an information-theoretic criterion to compress historical information without losing predictive power.

Result: MPS-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy scenarios, while demonstrating superior robustness.

Conclusion: The MPS principle offers a general regularization framework to enhance other architectures, showcasing its broad applicability.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

*Jueon Park,Yein Park,Minju Song,Soyon Park,Donghyeon Lee,Seungheun Baek,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoTox integrates LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable multi-toxicity prediction, outperforming traditional models by leveraging chemical, biological, and textual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of current toxicity prediction models (reliance on annotated data, lack of interpretability) and leveraging LLMs for biological context.

Method: Combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and GO terms with GPT-4o for step-by-step reasoning. Uses IUPAC names for better LLM understanding.

Result: Outperforms traditional ML and deep learning models. Enhanced reasoning and predictive performance with IUPAC names. Aligns predictions with physiological responses.

Conclusion: CoTox demonstrates LLMs' potential for interpretable toxicity prediction, aiding early-stage drug safety assessment.

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

*Lasse Bohlen,Sven Kruschel,Julian Rosenberger,Patrick Zschech,Mathias Kraus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines whether interpretable ML models reduce algorithm aversion compared to adjustable predictions, finding adjustability effective but transparency less impactful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if interpretable ML models can reduce algorithm aversion or replace the need for adjustable predictions, given prior findings on adjustability's effectiveness.

Method: Conceptually replicates a prior study on adjustable predictions and extends it with an interpretable ML model, tested via a pre-registered user study with 280 participants.

Result: Adjustability reduces algorithm aversion as expected, but transparency's impact is smaller and not significant; their effects are more independent than anticipated.

Conclusion: Adjustability remains effective in reducing aversion, while interpretability's role is limited and does not replace the need for adjustability.

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning architecture using quantum spectral methods for interpretable signal analysis and symbolic reasoning, avoiding traditional neural networks and black-box models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent, physically grounded alternative to deep learning models by leveraging spectral methods and symbolic reasoning.

Method: Uses Pade approximants and Lanczos algorithm for spectral representation, maps resonant structures to symbolic predicates, and employs rule-based reasoning.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy in tasks like anomaly detection and symbolic classification while maintaining interpretability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The architecture offers a promising direction for physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

*Qi Lv,Lei Geng,Ziqiang Cao,Min Cao,Sujian Li,Wenjie Li,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AS-Softmax improves softmax by focusing on strong opponents and adaptive gradient accumulation, enhancing training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax's unreachable target score leads to overfitting and inefficiency. AS-Softmax aims to align training with test goals and optimize learning.

Method: AS-Softmax discards irrelevant classes during training and uses adaptive gradient accumulation to speed up learning.

Result: AS-Softmax outperforms softmax variants across tasks, with better validation correlation and 1.2x training speedup.

Conclusion: AS-Softmax is a superior alternative to softmax, improving efficiency and performance in classification tasks.

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper reviews the application of scaling laws in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), focusing on data, network, and training budget scaling to enhance decision-making performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite scaling laws' success in computer vision and NLP, their potential in DRL remains underexplored. This review aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Systematic analysis of scaling strategies in three dimensions: data (parallel sampling, data generation), network (architectural enhancements, ensemble methods), and training budget (distributed training, large batch sizes).

Result: The review highlights synergistic roles of these strategies in advancing DRL and provides a roadmap for future research.

Conclusion: Balancing scalability with computational efficiency is crucial for unlocking DRL's potential in tasks like robot control and autonomous driving.

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Motivation: To analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors in diffusion models, improving existing results and introducing new bounds.

Method: A simple framework to analyze errors, focusing on spatial regularity of the learned score function and controlling score error relative to the true reverse process.

Result: First Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and improved results for the Euler sampler.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity and proper score error control, aligning with denoising score matching.

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how input correlations evolve in practical, finite-size neural networks, beyond the assumptions of mean-field theory for infinitely wide networks.

Method: Analyze information propagation in randomly initialized finite-width networks and use Fourier-based structured transforms for convolutional networks.

Result: The boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes exhibits a fractal structure, and similar behavior is observed in convolutional networks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the complexity of neural network dynamics and the tradeoff between separation and robustness in finite-depth networks.

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of rigorous statistical guarantees and computational inefficiency in existing MU methods, driven by data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

Method: Proposes a new MU definition using Conformal Prediction (CP), formalizes conformal criteria, and introduces metrics (ECF and EuCF) to evaluate unlearning. A practical method optimizes these metrics.

Result: The approach effectively removes targeted data across diverse scenarios, datasets, and models, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The CP-based MU method provides statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees and practical effectiveness, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HALO, a hindsight-augmented learning method for online auto-bidding, addresses inefficiencies in traditional solutions by leveraging all explorations as training data and using B-spline functional representation for robust adaptation to diverse budget-ROI constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-bidding solutions struggle with sample inefficiency and limited generalization under diverse advertiser constraints (budgets and ROI targets).

Method: HALO introduces a hindsight mechanism to repurpose all explorations into training data and employs B-spline functional representation for continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping.

Result: Evaluations on industrial datasets show HALO outperforms traditional methods, reducing constraint violations and improving GMV.

Conclusion: HALO provides a robust solution for multi-constraint bidding in digital advertising, handling diverse advertiser requirements effectively.

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

*Irene Ferfoglia,Simone Silvetti,Gaia Saveri,Laura Nenzi,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework for time series classification combines accuracy and interpretability by embedding trajectories into Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts, providing human-understandable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in black-box deep learning methods for time series classification, especially in safety-critical applications.

Method: Proposes a novel STL-inspired kernel to map time series to STL formulae, jointly optimizing for accuracy and interpretability.

Result: Competitive performance with high-quality logical justifications for model decisions, offering both local and global explanations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

### [290] [The alpha-beta divergence for real and complex data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03272)
*Sergio Cruces*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends alpha-beta divergences to complex data, enabling interpolation of classical divergences and offering closed-form solutions for centroid optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of divergence frameworks for complex data, which is common in signal processing, by generalizing the alpha-beta family.

Method: Extends alpha-beta divergences to complex vectors, ensuring compatibility with Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances when hyperparameters are set to unity.

Result: Provides a closed-form expression for centroids in complex vector approximation, clarifying hyperparameter roles.

Conclusion: The extended alpha-beta divergences are versatile and applicable to signal processing with complex data.

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

### [291] [Understanding the Embedding Models on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03280)
*Yubo Wang,Shimin Di,Zhili Wang,Haoyang Li,Fei Teng,Hao Xin,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models' performance stems from their base KGE model or extension modules. It finds some KGE models match HKGE performance, highlights decomposition flaws, and proposes FormerGNN for better HKG handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify if HKGE models' superiority comes from base KGE models or qualifier modules, and address limitations in current HKG decomposition and information integration.

Method: Decomposes HKGs into KGs using three methods, evaluates classical KGE models, and proposes FormerGNN with qualifier integrator and GNN-based encoder.

Result: Some KGE models perform comparably to HKGE models; decomposition alters HKG topology. FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Conclusion: Current HKGE models have limitations; FormerGNN offers improved performance by preserving HKG topology and addressing information compression.

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

*Giovanni Donghi,Luca Pasa,Daniele Zambon,Cesare Alippi,Nicolò Navarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a general framework for online Continual Learning (OCL) on graphs, addressing efficiency and evaluation challenges, and benchmarks existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs evolve over time, requiring timely predictions, but current OCL approaches lack a clear definition and alignment with streaming graph data.

Method: The authors introduce a general formulation for OCL on graphs, focusing on efficient batch processing and systematic evaluation.

Result: They benchmark several adapted CL methods, providing performance insights in the proposed OCL setting.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for OCL on graphs, enabling better evaluation and adaptation of methods for streaming graph data.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A game-theoretic model analyzes strategic interactions in hypothesis testing between a principal and an agent, revealing monotonic error behavior and an optimal p-value threshold, validated with drug approval data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how a strategic agent's private beliefs and profit motives influence hypothesis testing outcomes in a principal-agent framework.

Method: Develop a game-theoretic model to study the agent's behavior in response to the principal's statistical decision rule, focusing on p-value thresholds.

Result: Principal's errors show monotonic behavior with a critical p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable optimal threshold, empirically validated with drug approval data.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive view of strategic interactions in hypothesis testing, offering technical and regulatory insights.

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

*Svenja Ehlers,Merten Stender,Norbert Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework is proposed for real-time, phase-resolved ocean wave field prediction without needing ground truth data, using sparse measurements and physics-based constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of predicting ocean wave fields accurately in real-time due to lack of practical data assimilation methods and infeasibility of obtaining large labeled datasets.

Method: Embedding residuals of free surface boundary conditions into the loss function of a neural operator (PINO) to constrain solutions without ground truth data.

Result: Accurate reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from sparse measurements (buoy time series and radar snapshots), validated with synthetic data.

Conclusion: PINO enables robust, real-time wave field reconstruction and prediction, applicable in realistic marine environments.

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates bias mitigation methods for tabular data, finding a zero-sum trade-off, and explores an alternative approach to improve fairness without negatively impacting privileged groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the leveling-down effect in bias mitigation applies to tabular data tasks and explore methods to achieve fairness without zero-sum trade-offs.

Method: Evaluated eight bias mitigation methods across 44 tasks using five real-world datasets and four ML models, and tested an alternative approach focusing on unprivileged groups.

Result: Bias mitigation for tabular data operates in a zero-sum fashion, but an alternative method showed potential to benefit unprivileged groups without harming privileged ones.

Conclusion: The study identifies pathways for fairness improvements without zero-sum trade-offs, aiding broader adoption of bias mitigation methods.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LieQ is a metric-driven post-training quantization framework for sub-7B models, achieving state-of-the-art compression-accuracy trade-offs at extreme low-bit precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are often over-provisioned, with many layers contributing little unique information but dominating memory and energy usage. LieQ aims to maintain accuracy under extreme low-bit compression.

Method: LieQ introduces three layer-wise diagnostics (Perplexity Drop, Representational Compactness, Top-k Energy Gain) to enable automatic bit-width allocation without gradient updates.

Result: On Qwen3-4B, LieQ recovers 95.9% of FP16 performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ and AWQ. On LLaMA3.2-3B, it maintains 98.2% accuracy at 2.07-bit with 4x memory reduction.

Conclusion: LieQ sets new paradigms for deploying small language models on resource-constrained edge devices by achieving superior compression-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning-based scheme using multi-Neural Networks (NNs) is introduced to predict hydrogen trapping parameters from TDS spectra, overcoming challenges in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDS methods struggle to accurately extract key parameters like trap binding energies and densities due to their indirect nature.

Method: A multi-NN model (classification and regression) trained on synthetic data predicts trap types, densities, and binding energies from experimental TDS spectra.

Result: The model showed strong predictive performance when tested on three tempered martensitic steels of varying compositions.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning approach effectively identifies trapping parameters, with the code made freely available for use.

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

TL;DR: AI on the Pulse is a real-time anomaly detection system for patient monitoring using wearable sensors and AI, outperforming 12 SoTA methods with a 22% F1 score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continuous, non-invasive health monitoring without clinical-grade equipment, addressing the impracticality of continuous labeling in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses UniTS, a universal time-series model, to autonomously learn patient patterns and detect deviations via anomaly detection, integrating wearable sensors and ambient intelligence.

Result: Outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly detection methods, with a ~22% F1 score improvement, and successfully deployed in real-world settings (@HOME).

Conclusion: AI on the Pulse proves effective for real-world patient monitoring, offering high-quality insights without clinical-grade devices, enhanced by LLMs for interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

TL;DR: A hierarchical agent framework automates molecular optimization, improving binding affinity by 31% in multi-agent setups, while single-agent runs yield better drug-like properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate drug discovery by addressing scattered data, expertise, and tools, enabling faster design cycles.

Method: A multi-agent system with specialized roles (e.g., AI Expert, Medicinal Chemist) automates molecular optimization, using large language models (LLMs) and docking tools.

Result: Multi-agent setups improved binding affinity by 31%, while single-agent runs produced superior drug-like properties. Unguided LLMs were faster but lacked transparency.

Conclusion: Agent frameworks with provenance and feedback loops enhance auditable molecular design, suggesting expansion to ADMET and selectivity predictors for further workflow improvements.

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

TL;DR: The paper applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn interactions in software engineering tasks, improving success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL applications to LLMs focus on single-turn problems, lacking feedback-rich environments like real-world software engineering. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: Uses a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm to train a Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct agent for software engineering tasks.

Result: Increases success rate from 20% to 39% on SWE-bench Verified and matches or outperforms leading models on SWE-rebench.

Conclusion: Demonstrates RL's potential for complex multi-turn tasks, offering a path to more capable autonomous agents based on open models.

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

TL;DR: SLA-MORL is a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for dynamic resource allocation in cloud ML workloads, reducing training time, costs, and improving SLA compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in balancing training time, costs, and SLA compliance in cloud ML workloads, with traditional methods leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Uses adaptive multi-objective RL with intelligent initialization and dynamic weight adaptation, leveraging a 21-dimensional state and actor-critic network.

Result: Achieves 67.2% faster training for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8% cost reduction, and 73.4% better SLA compliance.

Conclusion: SLA-MORL effectively balances performance, cost, and reliability in cloud ML resource management.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA) improves parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) by using a mixture of Kronecker products for more expressive adaptation, achieving better performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-rank adapters in PEFT are limited in expressiveness due to rank constraints, restricting performance on complex tasks.

Method: MoKA models weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products, using a gating mechanism for importance measurement and enabling rank flexibility.

Result: MoKA outperforms PEFT baselines, reduces trainable parameters by up to 27x, and achieves state-of-the-art performance-parameter efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: MoKA is a hardware-efficient, highly expressive adapter for PEFT, offering superior performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix

only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable

and parameter efficiency.

### [303] [VRPRM: Process Reward Modeling via Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03556)
*Xinquan Chen,Bangwei Liu,Xuhong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRPRM introduces visual reasoning to enhance PRM's long-term reasoning, using a two-stage training strategy to reduce annotation costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs lack long-term reasoning, and CoT-PRM data annotation is costly. VRPRM aims to address these issues.

Method: VRPRM combines visual reasoning with a two-stage training strategy, using minimal CoT-PRM and non-CoT PRM data.

Result: VRPRM outperforms non-thinking PRMs with 118% improvement, using far less data (3.6K CoT-PRM and 50K non-CoT PRM).

Conclusion: VRPRM offers a cost-effective, high-performance alternative for PRM training, improving reasoning with efficient data use.

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

*Weiyao Zhang,Jinyang Li,Qi Song,Miao Wang,Chungang Lin,Haitong Luo,Xuying Meng,Yujun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Horus is a robust FL framework using low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to mitigate poisoning attacks in hyper-heterogeneous settings by focusing on stable layers and filtering malicious clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially under hyper-heterogeneity, which complicates detection and aggregation.

Method: Horus inserts LoRAs into stable layers, aggregates only LoRAs, and uses a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score to filter poisoned clients. A projection-aware aggregation mechanism is then applied.

Result: Horus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness and accuracy across diverse datasets, models, and attacks.

Conclusion: Horus effectively addresses FL vulnerabilities in hyper-heterogeneous environments by leveraging LoRAs and novel filtering/aggregation techniques.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFaith is a unified, model-agnostic XAI framework that optimizes faithfulness across multiple metrics, providing a theoretical ground truth for explanations. It outperforms baselines in 12 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods lack a unified ground truth for evaluating and optimizing explanations due to the absence of an optimal explanation standard.

Method: DeepFaith formulates multiple faithfulness metrics into a unified objective, trains an explainer using supervised signals from existing methods, and optimizes for pattern consistency and local correlation.

Result: DeepFaith achieves the highest faithfulness across 10 metrics in 12 diverse tasks, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability.

Conclusion: DeepFaith provides a robust, domain-free solution for generating faithful explanations, addressing the lack of a unified evaluation standard in XAI.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

*Zilei Shao,Anji Liu,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Silent Gradients, a method to avoid variance in gradient estimation for VAEs by analytically computing the expected ELBO, improving training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training VAEs is hindered by gradient variance from stochastic sampling, slowing convergence and degrading performance.

Method: Proposes Silent Gradients, using specific decoder architectures for zero-variance gradient computation, and a training dynamic combining exact gradients with stochastic estimators.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over existing estimators in controlled settings and improves performance across datasets.

Conclusion: Silent Gradients offers a stable, high-performance approach for training generative models by blending analytical computation with deep architectures.

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

### [307] [VITA: Variational Pretraining of Transformers for Climate-Robust Crop Yield Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03589)
*Adib Hasan,Mardavij Roozbehani,Munther Dahleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VITA is a variational pretraining framework for crop yield forecasting, addressing data asymmetry by using weather variables as proxy targets. It outperforms existing models, especially in extreme weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crop yield forecasting is critical for food security, but current AI models underperform when yields deviate from historical trends due to data asymmetry.

Method: VITA uses variational inference and self-supervised feature masking during pretraining, leveraging weather variables as proxy targets. It fine-tunes with basic weather statistics.

Result: VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in U.S. Corn Belt counties, with significant improvements in extreme weather years. It outperforms models like GNN-RNN using less data.

Conclusion: VITA demonstrates how domain-aware AI can overcome data limitations, enhancing agricultural forecasting resilience in a changing climate.

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarSeer, an AI model, forecasts solar irradiance 1,500x faster than traditional NWP, reducing errors by 27.28% in reanalysis and 15.35% at stations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is crucial for solar PV systems, but traditional NWP models are computationally expensive.

Method: SolarSeer maps historical satellite data directly to forecasts, bypassing costly data assimilation and PDE solving.

Result: SolarSeer operates 1,500x faster, reduces RMSE by 27.28% (reanalysis) and 15.35% (stations), and improves irradiance fluctuation capture.

Conclusion: SolarSeer's fast, accurate forecasts support sustainable energy systems.

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

### [309] [Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03663)
*Deepak Pandita,Flip Korn,Chris Welty,Christopher M. Homan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between the number of items (N) and annotations per item (K) in machine learning evaluations, finding that accounting for human disagreement is feasible with N × K ≤ 1000, often requiring K > 10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in ML evaluations is crucial, but human disagreement in annotations is often ignored due to budget constraints. This study aims to optimize the (N, K) configuration for reliable evaluations.

Method: Analyzed categorical datasets with multiple annotations per item and simulated distributions to determine optimal (N, K) under fixed budgets.

Result: Human disagreement can be addressed with N × K ≤ 1000, often requiring K > 10. The trade-off between K and N depends on the evaluation metric, with distribution-sensitive metrics benefiting from higher K.

Conclusion: The findings guide ML practitioners in optimizing data collection for reliable evaluations by balancing N and K based on budget and metric sensitivity.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

*Bhavesh Neekhra,Debayan Gupta,Partha Pratim Chakravarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature selection (FS) in high-dimensional datasets, like gene expression, may not improve model performance, as random subsets often perform comparably or better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the effectiveness of FS algorithms by comparing them against randomly selected features.

Method: Testing the null hypothesis of using randomly selected features against FS-selected features in classification tasks.

Result: Random feature subsets (0.02%-1%) perform comparably to FS-selected features, challenging the utility of FS in genomics.

Conclusion: FS may not be useful for high-dimensional datasets, raising concerns about studies relying on computationally selected genes without lab validation.

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automated theorem proving by developing smaller, more efficient models that outperform larger competitors.

Method: Uses expert iteration and reinforcement learning with scaffolded data synthesis, verifier-guided self-correction, and model averaging.

Result: Goedel-Prover-V2-8B achieves 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F, and the flagship 32B model reaches 90.4% in self-correction mode, surpassing prior SOTA.

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2 sets a new benchmark for open-source theorem provers, offering superior performance with smaller model sizes and compute budgets.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU combine convolutional spatial modeling with efficient parallel training, outperforming traditional ConvRNNs in speed and accuracy for spatiotemporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity by improving training efficiency and reducing bottlenecks in conventional ConvRNNs.

Method: Extends log-domain prefix-sum formulation to convolutional architectures, incorporating exponential gating for simplified computation.

Result: Faster training, lower prediction errors, and improved scalability compared to standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs.

Conclusion: Minimal recurrent structures with convolutional input aggregation offer an efficient alternative for spatiotemporal modeling.

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

*Farzad Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the traditional view that the sample complexity of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is tied to the minimum pairwise separation between components. It introduces the Pair Correlation Factor (PCF) as a better geometric measure and presents an algorithm with improved sample complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work linked GMM sample complexity to the minimum pairwise separation, but this is incomplete. The paper aims to identify a more accurate geometric property (PCF) to better understand the difficulty of parameter recovery.

Method: The authors introduce the Pair Correlation Factor (PCF) to capture the clustering of component means. They analyze its impact on sample complexity and propose an algorithm for the uniform spherical case.

Result: The PCF more accurately dictates parameter recovery difficulty than the minimum gap. In the uniform spherical case, the algorithm shows when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are needed.

Conclusion: The PCF is a better indicator of GMM sample complexity than the minimum pairwise separation, and the proposed algorithm demonstrates improved bounds in specific cases.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to fine-tune a pretrained model with patient-specific weights improves seizure onset zone (SOZ) classification accuracy by over 10% on average, addressing the cross-patient problem in epilepsy diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying SOZ in focal epilepsy patients due to variability in individual patient data distributions necessitates a tailored machine learning approach.

Method: Train a model via supervised learning, define patient-specific weights using intermediate features, and fine-tune the model with these weights.

Result: Improved classification accuracy for each test patient, averaging over 10% better performance.

Conclusion: Patient-specific fine-tuning enhances machine learning reliability in epilepsy diagnosis, tackling the cross-patient variability issue.

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices affect the compatibility of internal representations and whether structural regularities can enhance representational alignment.

Method: Develops a framework combining theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments to analyze representational alignment across networks with related architectural priors.

Result: Structural regularities lead to more stable representational geometry under architectural variation, improving feature interoperability across models.

Conclusion: Inductive biases not only aid generalization but also enhance representational transferability, with implications for model distillation, modular learning, and robust system design.

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Morphology-aware policy learning improves sample efficiency but lacks zero-shot performance. Combining it with parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) reduces the need for extensive data collection, achieving better performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sub-optimal zero-shot performance of morphology-aware policies and reduce computational costs in robotics applications by leveraging PEFT techniques.

Method: Combine morphology-aware pretraining with PEFT (tuning subsets of weights, input adapters, and prefix tuning) to specialize policies for target embodiments.

Result: PEFT with pretraining reduces samples needed for improvement. Tuning <1% of parameters outperforms zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: PEFT techniques enhance morphology-aware policies efficiently, making them practical for robotics.

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Motivation: LLMs lack verifiable guarantees despite producing fluent outputs, necessitating a method to ensure compliance with semantic and type requirements.

Method: A contract layer mediates LLM calls, stipulating input/output requirements and using probabilistic remediation to steer compliance. Contracts are defined by programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures.

Result: The approach probabilistically validates contract satisfaction and treats LLMs as semantic parsers and black-box components.

Conclusion: The work suggests that any agents satisfying the same contracts are functionally equivalent with respect to those contracts, providing a framework for reliable LLM usage.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

TL;DR: SkyGP is a streaming framework for Gaussian Processes that addresses computational and memory constraints while maintaining performance guarantees. Two variants, SkyGP-Dense and SkyGP-Fast, optimize for accuracy or efficiency, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact Gaussian Processes face scalability issues in real-time settings due to high computational and memory costs.

Method: SkyGP uses a bounded set of experts to reduce complexity, with variants SkyGP-Dense (accuracy-focused) and SkyGP-Fast (efficiency-focused).

Result: SkyGP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks and real-time control experiments.

Conclusion: SkyGP provides a scalable solution for real-time applications of Gaussian Processes without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Lili Chen,Mihir Prabhudesai,Katerina Fragkiadaki,Hao Liu,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM) use asymmetric self-play to improve reasoning skills without external data by generating and solving their own questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if language models can enhance reasoning skills autonomously by generating and solving their own questions, eliminating the need for curated datasets.

Method: Proposes SQLM: a framework with a proposer generating questions and a solver answering them, both trained via reinforcement learning with rewards for question difficulty and correctness.

Result: Tested on three benchmarks (multiplication, algebra, programming), showing improvement without external data.

Conclusion: Language models can autonomously improve reasoning skills through self-generated questions and solutions.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

*Simon Frieder,William Hart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies Yu Tsumura's 554th problem as a challenge for LLMs, despite their success in solving IMO-level problems, due to its specific characteristics and unsolved status by current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight limitations in LLMs' problem-solving abilities, even for problems within their training data and expected capability range.

Method: Analyzes Yu Tsumura's 554th problem, comparing it to IMO problems and testing LLMs' performance on it.

Result: No existing LLM (commercial or open-source) can solve the problem, despite its simplicity and likely inclusion in training data.

Conclusion: LLMs still have significant gaps in problem-solving, even for seemingly tractable problems.

Abstract: We show, contrary to the optimism about LLM's problem-solving abilities,
fueled by the recent gold medals that were attained, that a problem exists --
Yu Tsumura's 554th problem -- that a) is within the scope of an IMO problem in
terms of proof sophistication, b) is not a combinatorics problem which has
caused issues for LLMs, c) requires fewer proof techniques than typical hard
IMO problems, d) has a publicly available solution (likely in the training data
of LLMs), and e) that cannot be readily solved by any existing off-the-shelf
LLM (commercial or open-source).

*Ondrej Bajgar,Dewi S. W. Gould,Jonathon Liu,Alessandro Abate,Konstantinos Gatsis,Michael A. Osborne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic method for active IRL to ensure reliable policies with PAC guarantees, addressing the challenge of costly human demonstrations in critical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning AI decision-making with human preferences is crucial, especially in high-stakes domains like autonomous driving, where reliability is essential.

Method: The authors propose PAC-EIG, an acquisition function for active IRL, which maximizes information gain about policy regret to identify critical states needing demonstration. Reward-EIG is also introduced for reward-focused learning.

Result: The method provides theoretical PAC guarantees for active IRL with noisy demonstrations, outperforming prior heuristic approaches in experiments.

Conclusion: PAC-EIG offers a principled way to achieve reliable policies with formal guarantees, advancing active IRL in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

*Wenshuo Zhang,Leixian Shen,Shuchang Xu,Jindu Wang,Jian Zhao,Huamin Qu,Linping Yuan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper addresses misalignment between user intents and generated code in conversational LLMs by proposing a new interaction paradigm, NeuroSync, which improves alignment and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users with limited programming experience face frustration due to misalignment between their intents and LLM-generated code, caused by bidirectional ambiguity in expressing and interpreting nonlinear intents and tasks.

Method: The paper introduces direct intent-task matching, implemented in NeuroSync, which externalizes LLM understanding via a knowledge distillation pipeline and visualizations for user inspection and editing.

Result: NeuroSync enhances intent-task alignment, reduces cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency, as validated by technical experiments and a user study (N=12).

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm and NeuroSync effectively address the misalignment issue, offering a more intuitive and efficient human-LLM interaction for domain users.

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited
programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often
face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in
frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause
of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents
and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and
interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we
propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that
externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,
the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code
generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in
NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM
understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by
allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We
evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and
assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The
results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort,
and improves coding efficiency.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in collecting everyday emotion data for AI, proposing the AnnoSense framework based on stakeholder insights, and evaluates its potential for real-world emotion AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of gathering high-quality emotion data and annotations in real-world settings for effective AI algorithms.

Method: Collected 75 survey responses, 32 public interviews, and 3 FGDs with mental health professionals (119 stakeholders total) to develop AnnoSense, later evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts.

Result: AnnoSense framework was developed and positively evaluated for clarity, usefulness, and adaptability in supporting everyday emotion data collection.

Conclusion: AnnoSense shows promise for improving real-world emotion data collection and analysis, with implications for future emotion AI research.

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and
with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial
intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday
settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require
high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards
collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic
emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become
increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion
data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75
survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained
from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework,
AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This
framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity,
usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and
implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its
potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world
contexts.

*Nilesh Kumar Sahu,Aditya Sneh,Snehil Gupta,Haroon R Lone*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores user receptivity to mental health interventions via mobile apps, focusing on acceptance and feasibility, using passive sensing and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how context affects engagement with mental health interventions and optimize delivery for real-world usability.

Method: A two-week study with 70 students using a custom Android app (LogMe) that collected passive sensor data and active context reports, employing Thompson Sampling for adaptive interventions.

Result: Passively sensed data significantly influenced user receptivity, showing potential for optimizing intervention delivery.

Conclusion: The findings aid in designing context-aware, adaptive mental health interventions that are timely and actionable.

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time
monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed
smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune
moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior
research has examined how context affects user responses to generic
notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored
its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions.
Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when
users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to
understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with
and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components:
acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to
act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study
with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive
sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions.
The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a
reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating
smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility,
and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize
intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results
show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user
receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design
of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also
actionable in real-world settings.

*Sangho Suh,Michael Lai,Kevin Pu,Steven P. Dow,Tovi Grossman*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces StoryEnsemble, an AI-integrated tool for dynamic design exploration and iteration, addressing challenges like time constraints in design processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers often struggle with time and resource limitations, hindering broad exploration and iteration, which are core to design principles.

Method: Conducted a formative study with 15 participants (UX practitioners, students, instructors) and developed StoryEnsemble, an AI-powered node-link interface tool.

Result: A user study with 10 participants showed StoryEnsemble supports rapid, multi-directional iteration and flexible navigation across design stages.

Conclusion: StoryEnsemble demonstrates how AI can enhance iterative design practices by making exploration and iteration more fluid and accessible.

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across
interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution
ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder
designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier
assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice.
To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15
participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on
the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a
node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support
dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with
10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional
iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our
understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by
introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid,
accessible, and engaging.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Navigation Pixie is a dynamic navigation agent for metaverse platforms, improving user exploration and dwell time with minimal platform dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial metaverse platforms lack adaptive navigation aids, and prior research hasn't addressed diverse, real-world settings.

Method: Uses a loosely coupled architecture with spatial metadata and LLM-based NLP, tested on Cluster with PC and VR-HMD users.

Result: Increased dwell time and exploration; PC users preferred on-demand help, while VR users valued social context.

Conclusion: Advances VR interaction design, provides cross-platform evaluation methods, and enables commercial metaverse experimentation.

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content,
they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users'
interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand
agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with
diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a
loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with
LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies,
which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse
platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform
Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that
Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration
compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms.
Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC
environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD.
This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through
conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation
methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates
empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'science fiction science,' a method using experiments to simulate future technologies and measure their social/behavioral impact quantitatively, addressing validity concerns and advocating for its normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict and guide the development and regulation of future technologies by overcoming the limitations of qualitative methods.

Method: Uses experimental simulations of future technologies to collect quantitative data on attitudes and behaviors, termed 'science fiction science.'

Result: Identifies validity threats and suggests constraints and immersive methods to address them, advocating for broader adoption.

Conclusion: Encourages normalization of 'science fiction science' to improve validity and foster a virtuous cycle of research and impact.

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before
they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation
before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied
on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses
experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative
measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled
variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We
suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet,
despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be
reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science
fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on
the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the
unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We
seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been
marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on
strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the
diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle
of validity improvement.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores the use of live video AI (ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video) by blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals, highlighting its strengths in static scenes but shortcomings in dynamic situations, along with usability and safety concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the benefits and challenges of live video AI for BVI individuals in real-world assistive tasks.

Method: An exploratory study with eight BVI participants using the AI in diverse scenarios (e.g., locating objects, recognizing landmarks).

Result: The AI excels in static scenes but struggles with dynamic descriptions. Users supplemented mobility strategies despite inaccuracies, but issues like hallucinations and sycophancy caused distrust.

Conclusion: Future assistive AI should integrate additional sensing, improve intervention timing, and address ecological and safety concerns.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or
visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and
engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video
feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to
support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we
present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants.
Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live
video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating
objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor
environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively
provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in
delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite
inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the
provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although
the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions,
assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses,
and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential
risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for
assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing
capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing
beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how users form epistemic relationships with AI in research and teaching, identifying five dynamic relationship types and advocating for a nuanced framework beyond static AI metaphors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors and how epistemic relationships form in human-AI interaction.

Method: Conducted 31 interviews with academics across disciplines, developed a five-part codebook, and identified five relationship types.

Result: Identified five relationship types (e.g., Instrumental Reliance, Co-agency Collaboration) showing dynamic, context-dependent epistemic roles.

Conclusion: Advocates for a nuanced framework capturing human-AI co-construction of knowledge, enriching HCI's understanding of AI's relational and normative dimensions.

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise
not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI
interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it
often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This
study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess,
trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31
interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook
and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent
Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic
Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and
human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and
context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a
more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge,
enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI
use.

*Wenbo Cao,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Stabilized Gradient Residual (SGR) loss to improve the efficiency of optimization-based PDE solvers, addressing slow convergence caused by the MSE loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based PDE solvers like ODIL and PINNs suffer from slow convergence due to the MSE loss, which worsens conditioning. This work aims to bridge the performance gap with classical solvers.

Method: Proposes the SGR loss, which modulates the condition number between the original system and its normal equations, and benchmarks it in ODIL and PINNs frameworks.

Result: SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster convergence than MSE loss in ODIL and consistently outperforms MSE in PINNs.

Conclusion: SGR loss bridges the gap between classical and optimization-based solvers, emphasizing the importance of loss conditioning for efficient PDE solver design.

Abstract: Optimization-based PDE solvers that minimize scalar loss functions have
gained increasing attention in recent years. These methods either define the
loss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),
or indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge
much more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as
inefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the
inefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly
forms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs
optimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual
(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition
number between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to
the MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence
behavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL
framework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and
compare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical
experiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL
framework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster
convergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework
shows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently
outperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge
the performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based
solvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key
insights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers.

TL;DR: The study evaluates accelerometer data transplantation for improving Earth's gravity field monitoring, comparing traditional and hybrid setups, with machine learning showing promise as a cost-effective solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate gravity field monitoring is crucial for climate and geodynamic studies, but current accelerometer limitations hinder performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of accelerometer configurations (EA, CAI, hybrid) and data transplantation using analytical and machine learning methods via LL-SST simulations.

Result: Dual hybrid configurations yield the best accuracy, but machine learning-supported transplant-based setups offer comparable performance with lower costs.

Conclusion: Combining quantum sensors and data-driven transplantation can enhance future satellite gravimetry missions for better global gravity monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of Earth's gravity field is essential for
tracking mass redistribution processes linked to climate variability,
hydrological cycles, and geodynamic phenomena. While the GRACE and GRACE
Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions have set the benchmark for satellite gravimetry
using low-low satellite to satellite tracking (LL-SST), the precision of
gravity field recovery still strongly depends on the quality of accelerometer
(ACC) performance and the continuity of ACC data. Traditional electrostatic
accelerometers (EA) face limitations that can hinder mission outcomes,
prompting exploration of advanced sensor technologies and data recovery
techniques. This study presents a systematic evaluation of accelerometer data
transplantation using novel accelerometer configurations, including Cold Atom
Interferometry (CAI) accelerometers and hybrid EA-CAI setups, and applying both
analytical and machine learning-based methods. Using comprehensive closed-loop
LL-SST simulations, we compare four scenarios ranging from the conventional
EA-only setup to ideal dual hybrid configurations, with a particular focus on
the performance of transplant-based approaches using different neural network
approaches. Our results show that the dual hybrid configuration provides the
most accurate gravity field retrieval. However, the transplant-based hybrid
setup, especially when supported by machine learning, emerges as a robust and
cost-effective alternative, achieving comparable performance with minimal extra
hardware. These findings highlight the promise of combining quantum sensor
technology and data-driven transplantation for future satellite gravimetry
missions, paving the way for improved global monitoring of Earth's dynamic
gravity field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs introduce demographic bias into citation workflows, focusing on gender bias in reference selection.

Method: Controlled experiments with pseudonymous author names, evaluating multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, Claude Haiku) by varying gender composition in candidate pools.

Result: Persistent preference for male-authored references and majority-group bias, amplified in larger pools. Bias varies by field, with social sciences showing the least.

Conclusion: LLMs can reinforce gender imbalances in citations, requiring effective mitigation before integration into academic workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research
assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation,
yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation

Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and
analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of
bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group
bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool.
These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly
attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis
indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social
sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce
or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective
mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender
disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into
high-stakes academic workflows.

### [333] [Approximate Proportionality in Online Fair Division](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03253)
*Davin Choo,Winston Fu,Derek Khu,Tzeh Yuan Neoh,Tze-Yang Poon,Nicholas Teh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores online fair division of indivisible goods, focusing on PROP1 fairness. It shows greedy algorithms fail against adaptive adversaries but finds success with non-adaptive adversaries and side-information like MIV predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work shows strong impossibility results for classic fairness notions in online fair division. This paper investigates PROP1, a relaxed fairness notion, to understand its approximability.

Method: The study evaluates greedy algorithms, random allocation, and learning-augmented approaches with MIV predictions.

Result: Greedy algorithms fail against adaptive adversaries, but random allocation works for non-adaptive ones. MIV predictions enable robust PROP1 approximations, while stronger fairness notions remain inapproximable.

Conclusion: PROP1 can be approximated in certain settings, but stronger fairness notions like EF1, MMS, and PROPX are still inapproximable even with perfect predictions.

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior
work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic
fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this
setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a
natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.
We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any
positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This
is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and
a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under
additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of
non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of
learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the
simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation
with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust
approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item
value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as
EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

### [334] [A Novel cVAE-Augmented Deep Learning Framework for Pan-Cancer RNA-Seq Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02743)
*Vinil Polepalli*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) for pan-cancer gene expression classification, achieving ~98% accuracy by augmenting training data with synthetic samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pan-cancer classification using RNA-Seq data is challenging due to high dimensionality and limited samples. The study aims to improve classification by addressing overfitting and class imbalance.

Method: Feature selection reduces gene expression features to 500. A cVAE generates synthetic samples for augmentation. A two-layer MLP classifier is trained on the augmented dataset.

Result: The framework achieves ~98% accuracy on a test set, outperforming classifiers trained on original data alone.

Conclusion: cVAE-based synthetic augmentation significantly improves pan-cancer prediction, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform
tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high
dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)
to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using
801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression
features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on
this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on
cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for
each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples
(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A
two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the
augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high
classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially
outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present
detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier
performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture
diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based
synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction
performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

*Conor Wallace,Umer Siddique,Yongcan Cao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransAM, a transformer-based agent modeling method that learns robust policy representations of other agents using only local trajectories, improving performance in multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent modeling methods often rely on unrealistic access to other agents' episodic trajectories, limiting their practicality in real-world applications.

Method: The proposed TransAM uses a transformer-based approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that captures other agents' policies.

Result: TransAM demonstrates strong policy representations, enhances agent modeling, and achieves higher episodic returns in cooperative, competitive, and mixed environments.

Conclusion: TransAM provides a practical and effective solution for agent modeling in multi-agent systems, outperforming existing methods by leveraging local trajectory data.

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies
within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the
behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches
assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often
unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent
modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the
other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In
this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent
modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that
effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to
higher episodic returns.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Comparison of learned (LDC) and engineered (Intention Communication) strategies in MARL shows engineered methods outperform in scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of learned vs. engineered communication in cooperative MARL tasks.

Method: LDC uses neural networks for concurrent message and action generation. Intention Communication employs ITGM and MGN for message formulation based on predicted states.

Result: Engineered approach outperforms learned, especially in complex environments.

Conclusion: Engineered communication strategies are more scalable and effective than learned ones in MARL.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies
in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the
learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents
generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered
approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation
Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages
based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their
success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable
conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable,
the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability,
particularly as environmental complexity increases.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: A scalable AI framework using large language models to analyze qualitative student feedback for teaching effectiveness, ensuring ethical safeguards and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale in large engineering programs, overcoming impractical traditional methods like manual review of student evaluations.

Method: Hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception handling of open-ended student feedback, combined with visual analytics for contextualizing numeric scores.

Result: Successful deployment in a large engineering college, with validation showing LLM-generated summaries reliably support formative evaluation and professional development.

Conclusion: AI systems, designed transparently and with shared governance, can enhance teaching excellence and continuous improvement in academic institutions.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for
large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens
of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student
evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and
inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework
for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The
system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception
handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding
ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through
percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The
approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in
qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer,
and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on
its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary
validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and
longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably
support formative evaluation and professional development. This work
demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared
governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale
within academic institutions.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of UAD 3.6's 2026 implementation on property valuation, proposing an AI-augmented framework to address technical and trust challenges while restructuring the market.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how regulatory standardization (UAD 3.6) and AI advancements can transform residential property valuation, addressing inefficiencies, biases, and systemic risks.

Method: Develops a three-layer AI-augmented valuation framework (physical data acquisition, semantic understanding, cognitive reasoning) and evaluates trust requirements (compliance, fairness, uncertainty).

Result: Identifies institutional failures (variability, biases) and proposes solutions integrating AI while preserving professional oversight.

Conclusion: Successful transformation requires human-AI collaboration, domain-specific evaluation, and addressing biases, enhancing valuation reliability and market efficiency.

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation
transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to
structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI
advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous
systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation
addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our
analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities
enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for
professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key
contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser
variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2)
developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition,
semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging
technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust
requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory
compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing
evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific
protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely
technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating
systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while
addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate
markets.

### [340] [The Silicon Reasonable Person: Can AI Predict How Ordinary People Judge Reasonableness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02766)
*Yonathan A. Arbel*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores whether large language models (LLMs) can predict human reasonableness judgments in legal contexts, finding they mirror human prioritization of social cues over economic efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning judges' intuitions with societal views on reasonableness judgments.

Method: Randomized controlled trials comparing humans and LLMs across legal contexts, analyzing over 10,000 simulated judgments.

Result: LLMs capture human decisional architecture, prioritizing social cues over economic efficiency in negligence cases.

Conclusion: LLMs can help calibrate judicial intuitions, test policy interpretations, and anticipate AI behavior in ethical frameworks.

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that
determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments
challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader
societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs)
can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across
multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate
that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially
their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize
social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring
human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate
intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy
interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument
reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions,
understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks
becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Motivation: To explore how AI agents can enhance Web3 ecosystems in areas like finance, governance, security, and trust, addressing gaps in current research.

Method: Analyzes 133 projects, develops a taxonomy, and investigates five research questions (RQs) on AI agent integration in Web3.

Result: Identifies patterns in project distribution, AI's role in DeFi and governance, security enhancements, and trust frameworks. Highlights scalability and ethical challenges.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for future research on robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with AI agents.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly
evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper
presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between
Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics,
governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing
projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market
landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and
capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key
integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing
decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3
governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via
intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing
(RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent
operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By
synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight
foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and
outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust,
intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent
interactions.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing AI's societal impact by operationalizing freedom, contrasting with the dominant 'responsible AI' paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI regulation focuses on risk mitigation but lacks systematic consideration of societal impact. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Develops a proto-framework using Kantian philosophy, focusing on freedom as capability and opportunity, applied via Sustainable Development Goals.

Result: The proto-framework offers a complementary approach to risk-based AI regulation, operationalizing freedom in societal impact assessment.

Conclusion: The framework is a step toward integrating freedom into AI policymaking, enhancing societal impact analysis beyond risk mitigation.

Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm,
with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus
is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration
of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing
the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom.
This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised
framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy
and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the
counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are
developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity.
These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that
systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable
Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based
approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept
of freedom in AI regulation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Source Code Agent framework to address the non-determinism of LLM agents by decoupling workflow logic from generative models, improving procedural fidelity and execution predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent non-determinism of LLM agents limits their use in structured environments requiring procedural fidelity and predictable execution.

Method: The framework uses an expert-defined Execution Blueprint (source code) for deterministic workflow execution, with LLMs handling bounded sub-tasks.

Result: The Source Code Agent outperforms baselines by 10.1 percentage points on the tau-bench benchmark, improving efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The framework enables verifiable and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in strict procedural environments.

Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM)
agents limits their application in structured operational environments where
procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This
limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic,
high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative
process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new
paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework
decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined
operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution
Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is
strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex
sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,
designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the
Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the
strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while
dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable
and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict
procedural logic.

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating performance profiles with program semantics using deep learning to improve profiler usability, combining Async Profiler with a CodeBERT-based model for better optimization insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Profilers are useful but place a burden on engineers to interpret complex data, especially when users are unfamiliar with the code, limiting their applicability.

Method: Combines Async Profiler's performance profiles with code summarization from a fine-tuned CodeBERT model, displayed in a GUI for call paths.

Result: The system effectively assists in analyzing Java benchmarks by linking inefficiencies to program semantics.

Conclusion: Integrating performance profiles with semantic code summaries enhances profiler usability and actionable optimization.

Abstract: Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in
understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks,
and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give
extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are
responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable
optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users
to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users
are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.
  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles
and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean
code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it
into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for
actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async
Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a
fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model. We demonstrate the code summaries of any
selected call path in a graphic user interface. Our system can effectively
assist analysis on many Java benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems with many concurrent engineers.

Method: The CQS system combines two fine-tuned Llama3 models (using SFT and offline RL) for issue detection and critiques, supplemented by hand-crafted rules to filter errors.

Result: Offline evaluations show high precision in issue detection, and real-world deployment achieved a 60% weekly user helpfulness rate.

Conclusion: The CQS system effectively improves code quality in industrial settings, with insights on curating developer feedback for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems presents significant
challenges, particularly in settings where a large numbers of engineers work
concurrently on a codebase. This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS)
system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide
actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3
models, fine-tuned (with SFT and offline RL approaches), to a) detect common
code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good
``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user
experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect
responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able
to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This
system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting
and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate,
demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment. In this paper, we
present details of the CQS system along with some learnings on curating
developer feedback to create training data for LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: REFINE is an automated framework for benchmarking LLM-based evaluators in software engineering, focusing on fine-grained quality assessment. It improves evaluator alignment in coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluations are costly and subjective, while existing automated methods lack granularity in assessing code quality. REFINE addresses this gap.

Method: REFINE uses a Hierarchy Dataset Builder to synthesize artifacts with degraded quality and an Evaluator Tester to measure evaluator alignment with expected rankings.

Result: REFINE improved alignment scores from below 0.7 to above 0.9 in coding tasks, aiding model training teams in release decisions.

Conclusion: REFINE successfully benchmarks and refines LLM-based evaluators, enhancing their reliability for software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language
models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However,
establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human
evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated
methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.
  We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation),
an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software
engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder
applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with
progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate
evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with
expected ordering.
  A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of
degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse
filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.
  While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the
practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's
internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and
summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using
industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that
lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks.
These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams
to support model release decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semantic gap between issue descriptions and faulty code makes issue localization challenging, requiring multi-hop reasoning and effective use of repository retrieval tools.

Method: ToolTrain combines rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to train LLMs for better tool utilization in issue localization.

Result: ToolTrain-trained models outperform existing methods, with a 32B model surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level localization, and improved localization aids issue resolution.

Conclusion: Training LLMs for issue localization is effective for automated software development, as demonstrated by ToolTrain's success.

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need
modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in
software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue
descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code
dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating
repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a
demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively
utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning
and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a
two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled
supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance
LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental
results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art
performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level
localization. The results also show that improved localization performance
translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further
demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective
strategy for improving automated software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BitsAI-Fix automates lint error remediation using LLMs, tree-sitter, and progressive RL, achieving 85% accuracy in production at ByteDance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing scale and complexity of enterprise codebases lead to overwhelming lint errors, causing technical debt and reduced efficiency.

Method: Uses tree-sitter for context expansion, LLMs for patch generation, and progressive RL for training. Includes rule-based rewards and code diff matching.

Result: Supported 5,000+ engineers, resolved 12,000+ issues, 85% accuracy, 1,000 weekly active users.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of LLM-based code remediation in enterprise settings, offering a scalable solution for industrial scenarios.

Abstract: As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume
of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to
continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency.
This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow
based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical
challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for
context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through
specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final
remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative
progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can
automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start
phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through
feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted
rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness
rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff
matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production
deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers,
resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85%
remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work
demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions
in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in
large-scale industrial scenarios.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach for code optimization in regulated industries, outperforming traditional methods like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and individual LLMs in cost and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations in regulated industries face challenges in using commercial LLMs due to privacy and compliance issues, necessitating an alternative for high-quality, cost-effective code optimization.

Method: Implemented a MoA approach combining multiple specialized LLMs, compared it with GA-based ensembles and individual LLMs using real-world industrial codebases.

Result: MoA achieved 14.3%-22.2% cost savings and 28.6%-32.2% faster optimization times with open-source models, while GA performed better with commercial models. Both ensembles outperformed individual LLMs.

Conclusion: The MoA approach provides a viable solution for regulated industries, balancing compliance and performance, with practical deployment guidelines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization
have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering
at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries
face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize
commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements,
creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization
while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a
Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple
specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm
(GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world
industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application
to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical
evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost
savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated
environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with
commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4)
Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations,
generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble
evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing
regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

*Julius Herb,Felix Fritzen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: UNO-CG is a hybrid solver combining machine-learned preconditioners with classical conjugate gradient methods to accelerate PDE solutions while ensuring convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient solvers for parametric PDEs in materials science, where classical methods are computationally expensive and machine learning lacks guaranteed accuracy.

Method: Introduces UNO-CG, using Unitary Neural Operators as preconditioners to accelerate conjugate gradient solvers, interpreted as data-driven Green's function discovery.

Result: UNO-CG reduces iterations significantly, competes with expert-designed preconditioners, and performs robustly across diverse boundary conditions.

Conclusion: UNO-CG offers a versatile, robust hybrid approach for solving homogenization problems, balancing speed and reliability.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations
(PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example,
there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with
heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their
behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for
a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical
numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid
theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence
remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging
as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed
accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is
possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both
data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce
UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using
specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence
by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a
modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a
data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate
iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems
involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our
results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number
of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for
homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG
maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where
many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and
robustness.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepUFNet, a physics-aware deep learning model combining UNet and Fourier neural networks, to accurately forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure for fluid flow past a rectangular cylinder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning frameworks for wall pressure prediction are limited to single snapshots with full spatial data, lacking spatiotemporal forecasting capabilities.

Method: Developed DeepUFNet with UNet and Fourier neural networks, incorporating physical high-frequency loss control during training. Validated using wind tunnel data from a rectangular cylinder.

Result: DeepUFNet accurately predicts spatiotemporal wall pressure, matching experimental data in statistical, temporal, spectral, and spatial metrics. Physical loss control improves high-frequency forecasting.

Conclusion: DeepUFNet effectively forecasts spatiotemporal wall pressure and demonstrates strong extrapolation ability with sparse inputs, enhancing high-frequency prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and
structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the
potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients
and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning
frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial
information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a
rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural
Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure
and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control
embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the
parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind
tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional
rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero
using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for
DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast
spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison
between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in
statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density,
spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that
embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the
DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting
spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting
high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the
DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information
input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study explores quantum neural networks (QNNs) for predicting protein binding energies, comparing them to classical models. QNNs showed higher accuracy on one unseen dataset and significantly faster training times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binding energy is critical in biomedical applications like drug development. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods for predicting binding energies.

Method: Thirty QNN variations were tested across three architectures with ten quantum circuits each. Performance was compared to a classical neural network using primary and unseen datasets.

Result: QNNs achieved ~20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset but lower on others. Training times were drastically shorter than classical models.

Conclusion: QNNs show potential for efficient binding energy prediction, though accuracy varies. Faster training times highlight their promise.

Abstract: Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular
interactions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the
natural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine
design, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have
been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental
techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making
significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has
demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of
quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.
Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,
raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding
energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of
QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer
perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct
architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure
their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with
that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial
neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset
was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen
samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models
achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although
their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models
exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their
classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein
binding energy prediction.

*Kisu Yang,Yoonna Jang,Hwanseok Jang,Kenneth Choi,Isabelle Augenstein,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust retrieval evaluation protocol to address spurious ties in low-precision relevance scoring, combining High-Precision Scoring (HPS) and Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM) for more reliable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-precision computations in retrieval systems introduce spurious ties, causing high variability in results and unreliable evaluation.

Method: The protocol includes HPS (upcasting final scoring to higher precision) and TRM (reporting expected scores, range, and bias to quantify uncertainty).

Result: Experiments show HPS reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values.

Conclusion: The combination of HPS and TRM enables consistent and reliable evaluation for lower-precision retrievals.

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is
widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when
computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we
observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high
variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less
reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation
protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision
Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to
resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware
Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to
quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple
models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate
that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately
recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and
reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

*Wenlong Wu,Haofen Wang,Bohan Li,Peixuan Huang,Xinzhe Zhao,Lei Liang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MultiRAG is a framework to reduce hallucination in multi-source RAG by addressing data sparsity and source inconsistencies with knowledge-guided methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate hallucination issues in LLMs when integrating multiple retrieval sources, which can worsen due to sparse data and source inconsistencies.

Method: Introduces a knowledge construction module using multi-source line graphs and a retrieval module with multi-level confidence calculations.

Result: Significantly improves reliability and efficiency in multi-source knowledge retrieval, validated on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: MultiRAG effectively reduces hallucination in multi-source RAG, enhancing performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to
address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,
introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination
problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse
distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the
sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that
implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source
scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyLate, a library for multi-vector neural ranking models, addressing limitations of single-vector approaches and enhancing retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-vector search compresses information into one vector, degrading performance in complex tasks. Multi-vector methods like ColBERT show promise but lack accessible tools.

Method: PyLate is built on Sentence Transformers, supporting multi-vector architectures with minimal code changes, efficient indexes, and modular features.

Result: PyLate enables state-of-the-art models (e.g., GTE-ModernColBERT, Reason-ModernColBERT) and accelerates research and application of late interaction models.

Conclusion: PyLate bridges the gap in practical adoption of multi-vector models, unlocking their potential in modern information retrieval systems.

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.
While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the
shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This
compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,
long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches
pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual
token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This
architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced
out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex
retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear
theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late
interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,
primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and
experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a
streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support
multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,
advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal
code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering
multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to
accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,
thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate
has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including
GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility
for both research and production environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Foundation-Expert Paradigm for deploying hyperscale recommender systems, addressing challenges like shifting data distributions and latency constraints. It leverages a central FM and lightweight expert models, deployed via HyperCast, achieving significant improvements at Meta.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of deploying hyperscale recommender systems, such as handling streaming data, diverse tasks, and strict latency constraints, which hinder progress compared to other fields like NLP and computer vision.

Method: The method involves training a central Foundation Model (FM) on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal data, then transferring knowledge to lightweight, surface-specific expert models using target-aware embeddings. HyperCast infrastructure supports this decoupled paradigm.

Result: The approach is deployed at Meta, serving tens of billions of daily requests, improving online metrics over the previous system while enhancing developer velocity and infrastructure efficiency.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates the first large-scale deployment of the Foundation-Expert Paradigm, providing a scalable, efficient blueprint for recommender systems.

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender
systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved
challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as
natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender
systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from
online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to
different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream
tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational
constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert
Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale
recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,
cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This
knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,
surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to
adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.
To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a
production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,
logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now
deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating
online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while
improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the
best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of
a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,
compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of
scaling laws in recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bank supervisors need to align new measures with historical precedents, requiring a reliable system to retrieve and reference past findings and measures.

Method: The system combines lexical, semantic, and CRR fuzzy set matching techniques, validated via Monte Carlo, and fine-tuned with a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder.

Result: Achieves MAP@100 of 0.83 and MRR@100 of 0.92, outperforming standalone lexical and semantic models.

Conclusion: The IR system is robust and accurate, significantly aiding supervisors in drafting well-informed measures.

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are
consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we
introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist
supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system
ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most
relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive
database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed
measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system
ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The
performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled
data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness
and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for
fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of
0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those
of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

*Marta Moscati,Shah Nawaz,Markus Schedl*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel recommender system (CoBraR) uses weight sharing between user and item neural networks to improve efficiency and beyond-accuracy metrics without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recommender systems use separate neural networks for user and item representations, which may not optimize joint embedding space efficiency. Weight sharing, proven effective in multimodal learning, is proposed to bridge this gap.

Method: The framework introduces a single Collaborative Branch for Recommendation (CoBraR) that shares weights between user and item neural networks to reduce parameters and improve joint embedding.

Result: Experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation show CoBraR reduces parameters and enhances beyond-accuracy aspects while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: CoBraR demonstrates potential for real-world applications by balancing efficiency and performance in recommender systems.

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often rely on representations of users and items in
a joint embedding space and on a similarity metric to compute relevance scores.
In modern RS, the modules to obtain user and item representations consist of
two distinct and separate neural networks (NN). In multimodal representation
learning, weight sharing has been proven effective in reducing the distance
between multiple modalities of a same item. Inspired by these approaches, we
propose a novel RS that leverages weight sharing between the user and item NN
modules used to obtain the latent representations in the shared embedding
space. The proposed framework consists of a single Collaborative Branch for
Recommendation (CoBraR). We evaluate CoBraR by means of quantitative
experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation. Our experiments show that
by reducing the number of parameters and improving beyond-accuracy aspects
without compromising accuracy, CoBraR has the potential to be applied and
extended for real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the relevance of keyphrase recommendations for eBay sellers and avoid search system overcrowding with irrelevant items, while aligning with both seller and search judgments.

Method: A novel two-step LLM distillation process: distilling from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using multi-task training, then using the student bi-encoder for keyphrase retrieval.

Result: The method improves bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM knowledge distillation in a multi-task setup effectively enhances keyphrase recommendation relevance.

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the
performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases
is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items
and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase
recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions.
Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing
LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in
several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation
process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR)
model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM
teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a
multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to
retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge
distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances
bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

approach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three
feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and
contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly
created collections, we develop content-based representations using item
embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We
tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and
address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases
in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through
extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our
A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase
in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,
our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,
enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food
collections in a dynamic commercial environment.

### [363] [Low-Communication Resilient Distributed Estimation Algorithm Based on Memory Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02705)
*Wei Li,Limei Hu,Feng Chen,Ye Yao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A resilient distributed estimation algorithm for multi-task adversarial networks, using reputation-based node selection and W-SVDD for trustworthiness, with reduced communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of accurate parameter estimation in distributed algorithms due to attacked nodes or links.

Method: Reputation-based node selection, W-SVDD model for trustworthiness, event-triggered mechanism to minimize updates, and convergence analysis.

Result: Superior performance with lower communication costs compared to other algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively enhances resilience and reduces communication overhead in adversarial environments.

Abstract: In multi-task adversarial networks, the accurate estimation of unknown
parameters in a distributed algorithm is hindered by attacked nodes or links.
To tackle this challenge, this brief proposes a low-communication resilient
distributed estimation algorithm. First, a node selection strategy based on
reputation is introduced that allows nodes to communicate with more reliable
subset of neighbors. Subsequently, to discern trustworthy intermediate
estimates, the Weighted Support Vector Data Description (W-SVDD) model is
employed to train the memory data. This trained model contributes to reinforce
the resilience of the distributed estimation process against the impact of
attacked nodes or links. Additionally, an event-triggered mechanism is
introduced to minimize ineffective updates to the W-SVDD model, and a suitable
threshold is derived based on assumptions. The convergence of the algorithm is
analyzed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
achieves superior performance with less communication cost compared to other
algorithms.

### [364] [Block: Balancing Load in LLM Serving with Context, Knowledge and Predictive Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03611)
*Wei Da,Evangelia Kalyvianaki*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Block is a distributed scheduling framework for LLM serving that optimizes load balancing and auto-provisioning, outperforming heuristic schedulers in capacity and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model serving systems use monolithic, heuristic schedulers, which lack efficiency and scalability for large-scale LLM serving.

Method: Block is a distributed, stateless, predictive scheduler leveraging deterministic LLM inference traits (e.g., host configs, response lengths) for decision-making.

Result: On a 12-GPU cluster, Block boosts serving capacity by 16.7% and cuts P99 latency by 49.5%, with consistent gains across models and workloads.

Conclusion: Block’s distributed, predictive approach significantly improves LLM serving performance, offering scalability and reliability.

Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to
optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large
language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from
incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic
and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed,
stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead,
reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable
characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response
lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on
accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block
significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up
to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance
gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.

*Hyung Gun Chi,Florian Pesce,Wonil Chang,Oggi Rudovic,Arturo Argueta,Stefan Braun,Vineet Garg,Ahmed Hussen Abdelaziz*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive knowledge distillation method to improve device-directed speech detection (DDSD) accuracy, achieving significant performance gains over non-distilled models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing DDSD accuracy is crucial for naturalistic user experience with voice assistants by distinguishing user queries from background speech.

Method: The authors introduce adaptive knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from a pre-trained ASR encoder (teacher) to a student model using task-specific adapters.

Result: The method improves Equal Error Rate by +26% for keyword and +19% for keyword-free invocations, and generalizes across transformer and conformer architectures.

Conclusion: Adaptive knowledge distillation effectively boosts DDSD performance, ensuring efficient deployment and better user experience.

Abstract: Device-directed speech detection (DDSD) is a binary classification task that
separates the user's queries to a voice assistant (VA) from background speech
or side conversations. This is important for achieving naturalistic user
experience. To this end, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance DDSD
accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment. Specifically, we introduce a
novel adaptive KD method that transfers knowledge from general representations
of an ASR large pre-trained acoustic encoder (teacher). We apply task-specific
adapters, on top of the (frozen) teacher encoder, trained jointly with the
student model on DDSD. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive KD outperforms
the student model without distillation in the keyword and keyword-free
(follow-up) invocations, with an improvement of +26% and +19% in terms of Equal
Error Rate, respectively. We also show that this approach generalizes across
the transformer and conformer-based model architectures.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A neural target speech extraction (TSE) system uses human feedback for iterative refinement, improving marked segments while preserving unmarked ones. Synthetic datasets train models, with noise power-based masking performing best. Users prefer refined outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural TSE by incorporating human feedback for iterative refinement, addressing the challenge of limited human-marked error datasets.

Method: Generates synthetic datasets using automated masking functions, trains models, and refines outputs based on user-marked segments. Noise power-based masking and probabilistic thresholding are key techniques.

Result: Models trained with noise power-based masking align best with human annotations. Users prefer refined outputs over baseline TSE.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop refinement improves neural speech extraction, showing promise for practical applications.

Abstract: We present the first neural target speech extraction (TSE) system that uses
human feedback for iterative refinement. Our approach allows users to mark
specific segments of the TSE output, generating an edit mask. The refinement
system then improves the marked sections while preserving unmarked regions.
Since large-scale datasets of human-marked errors are difficult to collect, we
generate synthetic datasets using various automated masking functions and train
models on each. Evaluations show that models trained with noise power-based
masking (in dBFS) and probabilistic thresholding perform best, aligning with
human annotations. In a study with 22 participants, users showed a preference
for refined outputs over baseline TSE. Our findings demonstrate that
human-in-the-loop refinement is a promising approach for improving the
performance of neural speech extraction.

TL;DR: DLPO improves diffusion-based TTS models by integrating training loss into RLHF, enhancing efficiency and speech quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for TTS are inefficient for real-time use and struggle with intonation/rhythm. DLPO aims to address these issues.

Method: Proposes DLPO, an RLHF framework that uses naturalness scores and integrates training loss into rewards for optimization.

Result: DLPO significantly improves objective (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective metrics, with 67% preference in evaluations.

Conclusion: DLPO enables efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS, suitable for real-time and resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for
real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation
and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy
Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO
integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving
generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores
as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's
structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a
non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant
improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective
evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings
demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in
real-time, resource-limited settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time speech separation on tiny, low-power hearable devices, overcoming compute limitations of existing models.

Method: Time-frequency domain processing with stacks of fully connected layers (alternating channel/frequency) and convolutional layers for time sequences. Mixed-precision quantization-aware training (QAT) is used.

Result: Processes 6 ms audio chunks in real-time on GAP9, achieving 3.5-4x runtime reduction vs. prior models.

Conclusion: TF-MLPNet is efficient and effective for real-time speech separation on low-power hearable accelerators.

Abstract: Speech separation on hearable devices can enable transformative augmented and
enhanced hearing capabilities. However, state-of-the-art speech separation
networks cannot run in real-time on tiny, low-power neural accelerators
designed for hearables, due to their limited compute capabilities. We present
TF-MLPNet, the first speech separation network capable of running in real-time
on such low-power accelerators while outperforming existing streaming models
for blind speech separation and target speech extraction. Our network operates
in the time-frequency domain, processing frequency sequences with stacks of
fully connected layers that alternate along the channel and frequency
dimensions, and independently processing the time sequence at each frequency
bin using convolutional layers. Results show that our mixed-precision
quantization-aware trained (QAT) model can process 6 ms audio chunks in
real-time on the GAP9 processor, achieving a 3.5-4x runtime reduction compared

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art speech intelligibility (mean Pearson correlation of 0.91 for Mel spectrograms), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: MiSTR advances iEEG-based speech synthesis, offering a robust solution for communication restoration.

Abstract: Speech synthesis from intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals offers a promising
avenue for restoring communication in individuals with severe speech
impairments. However, achieving intelligible and natural speech remains
challenging due to limitations in feature representation, prosody modeling, and
phase reconstruction. We introduce MiSTR, a deep-learning framework that
integrates: 1) Wavelet-based feature extraction to capture fine-grained
temporal, spectral, and neurophysiological representations of iEEG signals, 2)
A Transformer-based decoder for prosody-aware spectrogram prediction, and 3) A
neural phase vocoder enforcing harmonic consistency via adaptive spectral
correction. Evaluated on a public iEEG dataset, MiSTR achieves state-of-the-art
speech intelligibility, with a mean Pearson correlation of 0.91 between
reconstructed and original Mel spectrograms, improving over existing neural
speech synthesis baselines.

TL;DR: WhisperInject is a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that manipulates audio language models to generate harmful content using imperceptible perturbations, achieving over 86% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio interfaces for human-AI interaction introduce vulnerabilities, making them potential attack surfaces for adversaries.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD) in Stage 1 to bypass safety protocols, followed by Payload Injection with PGD in Stage 2 to embed perturbations in benign audio.

Result: Achieves a success rate exceeding 86% across tested models (Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, Phi-4-Multimodal).

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical audio-native threats, revealing a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life,
audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this
convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential
attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a
two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate
state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method
uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human
listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method,
Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the
target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native
responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2,
Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize
subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as
weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous
StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation
framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across
Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a
new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical
exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SonicMaster is a unified generative model for music restoration and mastering, using text-based control to address various audio artifacts. It outperforms traditional methods in quality and user preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music recordings often suffer from quality issues like reverberation and distortion, especially in non-professional settings. Current solutions require multiple tools and manual adjustments, motivating a unified approach.

Method: SonicMaster uses a flow-matching generative training paradigm, trained on a dataset of degraded and high-quality tracks simulated with 19 degradation functions across five enhancement groups. It operates via text prompts or automatically.

Result: Objective metrics and subjective tests show SonicMaster significantly improves audio quality and is preferred over original degraded tracks.

Conclusion: SonicMaster provides an effective, unified solution for music restoration and mastering, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive
reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo
image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized
equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate
specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce
SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and
mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based
control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply
targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general
restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large
dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common
degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five
enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our
approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an
audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered
versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate
that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact
categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners
prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio,
highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.

*Tianxin Xie,Shan Yang,Chenxing Li,Dong Yu,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, training-free emotion control in TTS via activation steering, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS systems lack fine-grained emotion control and require extensive datasets. EmoSteer-TTS addresses these limitations.

Method: Uses activation steering in flow matching-based TTS models, involving activation extraction, emotional token searching, and inference-time steering.

Result: Achieves fine-grained, interpretable, and continuous emotion control, outperforming SOTA.

Conclusion: EmoSteer-TTS is the first training-free method for continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most
existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via
discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text
prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or
unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for
training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel
training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control
(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first
empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within
a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of
synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free
and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token
searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into
a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In
addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated
emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and
continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art
(SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves
training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-shot machine learning models in materials design by creating an autonomous system for the entire discovery process.

Method: Introduces SparksMatter, which generates ideas, designs workflows, refines results, and proposes materials, while also critiquing and improving its own outputs.

Result: SparksMatter generates novel, stable inorganic structures, outperforming frontier models in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor.

Conclusion: SparksMatter demonstrates unique capability in generating valid, meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing knowledge.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials
design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet
they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into
their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system
capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle,

introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic
materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and
executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results,
and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives.
SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research
gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps,
including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization,
embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is
evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and
perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of
SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the
user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter
consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific
rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world
design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate
SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically
meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing

Motivation: Reliable uncertainty quantification in MLIPs is challenging but crucial for accurate atomistic modeling.

Method: Two UQ strategies (ensemble learning and D-optimality) are tested, and a clustering-enhanced local D-optimality method is introduced.

Result: Higher model accuracy improves uncertainty-error correlation and novelty detection. Clustering-enhanced D-optimality outperforms in heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of model fidelity and data heterogeneity on UQ and offers a robust method for active learning in MLIP development.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable accurate atomistic
modelling, but reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains elusive. In
this study, we investigate two UQ strategies, ensemble learning and
D-optimality, within the atomic cluster expansion framework. It is revealed
that higher model accuracy strengthens the correlation between predicted
uncertainties and actual errors and improves novelty detection, with
D-optimality yielding more conservative estimates. Both methods deliver well
calibrated uncertainties on homogeneous training sets, yet they underpredict
errors and exhibit reduced novelty sensitivity on heterogeneous datasets. To
address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality,
which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies
D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the
detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings
clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance
and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling
strategies for MLIP development.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy concerns in counterfactual explanations for black-box ML models, proposing schemes to protect user and institutional data while retrieving explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure user privacy when retrieving counterfactual explanations without revealing their feature vector to the institution.

Method: Introduces private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and immutable PCR (I-PCR) schemes, with theoretical privacy guarantees and numerical validation.

Result: Proposed schemes achieve perfect privacy for users and reduce database leakage, with extensions for user preferences.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances privacy and utility in counterfactual explanations, with practical applications in high-stake scenarios.

Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered
when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications.
Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement.
However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is
providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this
work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve
a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the
institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual
explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,
information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of
private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that
keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the
institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the
amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,
compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability
of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the
user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of
their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their
feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we
propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,
but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and
I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their
attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we
present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the
database leakage of the proposed schemes.

*Brennen A. Hill,Zhang Xinyu,Timothy Putra Prasetio*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: VCNet, inspired by primate visual cortex, outperforms CNNs in efficiency and robustness on specialized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CNNs (data inefficiency, poor generalization, adversarial vulnerability) by mimicking primate visual system.

Method: VCNet emulates hierarchical processing, dual-stream segregation, and top-down feedback from primate visual cortex.

Result: VCNet achieves 92.1% accuracy on Spots-10 and 74.4% on light field dataset, surpassing comparable models.

Conclusion: Neuroscientific principles in network design enhance efficiency and robustness, offering solutions for machine learning challenges.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.

### [380] [Investigation on deep learning-based galaxy image translation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03291)
*Hengxin Ruan,Qiufan Lin,Shupei Chen,Yang Wang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores how deep learning-based generative models preserve high-order physical information (like spectroscopic redshift) in galaxy image translation, testing four models and finding limitations despite success in pixel and morphology-level reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of discussion on preserving complex high-order physical information in galaxy image translation, crucial for high-fidelity applications.

Method: Tested four models (Swin Transformer, SRGAN, capsule network, diffusion model) on SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images to evaluate redshift preservation alongside pixel and morphology-level details.

Result: Models struggled to retain redshift information, with cross-band peak fluxes being informative but uncertain due to many-to-many mapping. Imperfect translations still hold value for less demanding applications.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in preserving high-order physical information in image translation but suggests potential for downstream uses, guiding future model development for scientific purposes.

Abstract: Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and
cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has
been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information
extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly
detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the
pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack
of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical
information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely
on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the
effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical
information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and
morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin
Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS
and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of
incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures
of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In
particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain
meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable
uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to
the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images
may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise
for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly
required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical
information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the
development of image translation models for scientific use.

TL;DR: A new corporate credit rating framework integrates financial data with textual insights from annual reports using FinBERT, improving prediction accuracy by 8-12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models overlook non-financial data like annual reports, missing valuable insights.

Method: Combines financial metrics with FinBERT-extracted features from annual reports, using the Comprehensive Corporate Rating Dataset (CCRD).

Result: Accuracy of rating predictions improved by 8-12%.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the effectiveness and reliability of corporate credit ratings by leveraging unstructured text data.

Abstract: Corporate credit rating serves as a crucial intermediary service in the
market economy, playing a key role in maintaining economic order. Existing
credit rating models rely on financial metrics and deep learning. However, they
often overlook insights from non-financial data, such as corporate annual
reports. To address this, this paper introduces a corporate credit rating
framework that integrates financial data with features extracted from annual
reports using FinBERT, aiming to fully leverage the potential value of
unstructured text data. In addition, we have developed a large-scale dataset,
the Comprehensive Corporate Rating Dataset (CCRD), which combines both
traditional financial data and textual data from annual reports. The
experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the
rating predictions by 8-12%, significantly improving the effectiveness and
reliability of corporate credit ratings.

*Yu Shi,Zongliang Fu,Shuo Chen,Bohan Zhao,Wei Xu,Changshui Zhang,Jian Li*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: Kronos is a pre-trained financial time series model that outperforms existing methods in forecasting, volatility prediction, and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) underperform on financial candlestick data and overlook key tasks like volatility prediction and synthetic data generation.

Method: Kronos uses a specialized tokenizer to discretize market data and is pre-trained autoregressively on 12 billion K-line records from 45 exchanges.

Result: Kronos improves price forecasting by 93% over leading TSFMs, reduces volatility MAE by 9%, and enhances synthetic data fidelity by 22%.

Conclusion: Kronos is a versatile foundation model for financial time series analysis, with publicly available pre-trained models.

Abstract: The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large
Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation
Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line)
data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures.
Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as
volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these
limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework
tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized
tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences,
preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos
using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12
billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced
temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting
across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts
price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the
best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility
forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line
sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation
model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is
publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: CTBench is a new benchmark for synthetic time series generation in cryptocurrency markets, addressing gaps in existing methods by evaluating models across 13 metrics in 5 dimensions, including forecasting, trading, and risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSG methods fail to address the unique complexities of cryptocurrency markets, such as 24/7 trading and extreme volatility, and lack financial evaluations for trading applications.

Method: CTBench introduces a dual-task evaluation framework: Predictive Utility for forecasting patterns and Statistical Arbitrage for trading signals, testing eight models across four market regimes.

Result: The benchmark reveals trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability, providing rankings and actionable guidance for model selection.

Conclusion: CTBench fills a critical gap in TSG for cryptocurrencies, offering a comprehensive tool for model evaluation and practical deployment in crypto analytics.

Abstract: Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress
testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in
cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and
rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and
benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work
(1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses
narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific
complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for
trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the
first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain.
\textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates
TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy,
rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational
efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the
\emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves
temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the
\emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support
mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models
from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering
trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably,
\textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for
selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for accurate yield forecasting in decentralized finance (DeFi) to guide liquidity allocation strategies.

Method: Benchmarking six models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, Transformer, QNN, QSVM-QNN) on historical data from 28 Curve Finance pools, evaluating performance using test MAE, RMSE, and directional accuracy.

Result: Classical ensemble models (XGBoost, Random Forest) outperform deep learning and quantum models, with XGBoost achieving the highest directional accuracy (71.57%) and Random Forest the lowest test MAE (1.77). Quantum models underperform with accuracy below 50%.

Conclusion: Classical methods are more robust than quantum approaches for DeFi yield forecasting, providing practical insights for model suitability in this domain.

Abstract: The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created a growing demand for
accurate yield and performance forecasting to guide liquidity allocation
strategies. In this study, we benchmark six models, XGBoost, Random Forest,
LSTM, Transformer, quantum neural networks (QNN), and quantum support vector
machines with quantum feature maps (QSVM-QNN), on one year of historical data
from 28 Curve Finance pools. We evaluate model performance on test MAE, RMSE,
and directional accuracy. Our results show that classical ensemble models,
particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperform both deep
learning and quantum models. XGBoost achieves the highest directional accuracy
(71.57%) with a test MAE of 1.80, while Random Forest attains the lowest test
MAE of 1.77 and 71.36% accuracy. In contrast, quantum models underperform with
directional accuracy below 50% and higher errors, highlighting current
limitations in applying quantum machine learning to real-world DeFi time series
data. This work offers a reproducible benchmark and practical insights into
model suitability for DeFi applications, emphasizing the robustness of
classical methods over emerging quantum approaches in this domain.

### [385] [Evaluating Transfer Learning Methods on Real-World Data Streams: A Case Study in Financial Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02702)
*Ricardo Ribeiro Pereira,Jacopo Bono,Hugo Ferreira,Pedro Ribeiro,Carlos Soares,Pedro Bizarro*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating transfer learning methods under dynamic data availability scenarios is proposed, enabling realistic simulation of real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transfer learning methods assume static data availability, which doesn't reflect real-world variability. A more dynamic evaluation approach is needed.

Method: The framework simulates varying data availability, creates multiple domains via resampling, and introduces domain variability through transformations like covariate and concept shifts.

Result: The framework was tested on proprietary card payment data and a public fraud dataset, demonstrating its utility for realistic evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework improves understanding of model behavior in dynamic settings, aiding better decision-making for real-world deployments.

Abstract: When the available data for a target domain is limited, transfer learning
(TL) methods can be used to develop models on related data-rich domains, before
deploying them on the target domain. However, these TL methods are typically
designed with specific, static assumptions on the amount of available labeled
and unlabeled target data. This is in contrast with many real world
applications, where the availability of data and corresponding labels varies
over time. Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed
under the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to
unrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings.
To support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and
models, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying
data availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through
resampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by
applying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of
potentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities
enable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments,
in turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms
when deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite
of card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we
also illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account
Fraud (BAF) dataset. By providing a methodology for evaluating TL methods over
time and in realistic data availability scenarios, our framework facilitates
understanding of the behavior of models and algorithms. This leads to better
decision making when deploying models for new domains in real-world
environments.

### [386] [Agentic Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02836)
*Mengyu Zhang,Zhuotao Liu,Jingwen Huang,Xuanqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Agentic-PPML is a novel framework to make privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) practical for large language models (LLMs) by separating intent understanding from secure inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PPML schemes for LLMs are inefficient, with performance gaps up to 10,000-fold slower than plaintext inference, especially with longer contexts.

Method: Agentic-PPML uses a general-purpose LLM for intent understanding and delegates secure inference to specialized models, avoiding encrypted prompt processing by LLMs.

Result: The framework enables practical deployment of privacy-preserving LLM services by modularizing sensitive and non-sensitive computations.

Conclusion: Agentic-PPML addresses the inefficiency of PPML in LLMs, making privacy-preserving AI services feasible.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is critical to ensure data privacy
in AI. Over the past few years, the community has proposed a wide range of
provably secure PPML schemes that rely on various cryptography primitives.
However, when it comes to large language models (LLMs) with billions of
parameters, the efficiency of PPML is everything but acceptable. For instance,
the state-of-the-art solution for confidential LLM inference represents at
least 10,000-fold slower performance compared to plaintext inference. The
performance gap is even larger when the context length increases. In this
position paper, we propose a novel framework named Agentic-PPML to make PPML in
LLMs practical. Our key insight is to employ a general-purpose LLM for intent
understanding and delegate cryptographically secure inference to specialized
models trained on vertical domains. By modularly separating language intent
parsing - which typically involves little or no sensitive information - from
privacy-critical computation, Agentic-PPML completely eliminates the need for
the LLMs to process the encrypted prompts, enabling practical deployment of
privacy-preserving LLM-centric services.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A multiplicative attack method is introduced to create untraceable DeepFakes, evading attribution models (AMs) even with defenses, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks on DeepFakes attribution models (AMs) fail to fully eliminate generative model (GM) traces, prompting the need for a more robust attack method.

Method: A universal, black-box attack method is designed using real data to train an adversarial model, applicable across various GMs and AMs.

Result: The method achieves a 97.08% average attack success rate (ASR) against 6 AMs on DeepFakes from 9 GMs, maintaining over 72.39% ASR with defenses.

Conclusion: The study highlights the threat of multiplicative attacks and the necessity for more resilient AMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFakes attribution technologies have significantly
enhanced forensic capabilities, enabling the extraction of traces left by
generative models (GMs) in images, making DeepFakes traceable back to their
source GMs. Meanwhile, several attacks have attempted to evade attribution
models (AMs) for exploring their limitations, calling for more robust AMs.
However, existing attacks fail to eliminate GMs' traces, thus can be mitigated
by defensive measures. In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes
can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally
eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive
measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an
adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and
agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack
capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average
attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes
generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method
maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\%. Our work underscores the potential
challenges posed by multiplicative attacks and highlights the need for more
robust AMs.

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM applications have
expanded into a growing number of fields. However, users with data privacy
concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private

challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources.
To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning
(SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting
LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at

for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the
choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant
hyperparameters for real-world applications.

TL;DR: MAST is a stealthy framework for attacking LLM-MAS by exploiting communication vulnerabilities, using adaptive multi-round strategies and ensuring stealthiness through semantic and embedding constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks on LLM-MAS are limited in effectiveness and stealthiness, prompting the need for a more adaptive and covert tampering method.

Method: MAST combines Monte Carlo Tree Search and Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack policy model, with dual semantic and embedding constraints for stealth.

Result: MAST achieves high attack success rates and improved stealthiness across diverse tasks and LLMs.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for robust safeguards in LLM-MAS due to MAST's effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability.

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively
accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but
this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack
methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct
and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and
stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy
Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within
the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference
Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates
effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve
stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints
during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks,
communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently
achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness
compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness,
stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust
communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces BadBlocks, a lightweight and covert backdoor attack method for diffusion models, requiring fewer resources and evading advanced defenses while maintaining high attack success and low quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on diffusion models are resource-intensive and detectable. The authors aim to develop a more efficient and stealthy method.

Method: BadBlocks selectively contaminates specific blocks in the UNet architecture of diffusion models without fine-tuning the entire network, using minimal computational resources.

Result: BadBlocks achieves high attack success rates and low perceptual quality loss, even under constrained resources, and bypasses current defense frameworks.

Conclusion: BadBlocks lowers the barrier for backdoor attacks, posing a novel threat to diffusion models, and highlights the importance of certain neural layers in backdoor mapping.

Abstract: In recent years,Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the
field of image generation.However,recent studies have shown that diffusion
models are susceptible to backdoor attacks,in which attackers can manipulate
the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or
textual phrases into the training dataset.Fortunately,with the continuous
advancement of defense techniques,defenders have become increasingly capable of
identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and
neural network-based detection methods.However,in this paper,we identify a
novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing
approaches,which we name BadBlocks,requires only about 30\% of the
computational resources and 20\% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor
attacks,yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced
defense frameworks.BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate
specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while
maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components.Experimental
results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate (ASR)
and low perceptual quality loss (as measured by FID Score),even under extremely
constrained computational resources and GPU time.Moreover,BadBlocks is able to
bypass existing defense frameworks,especially the attention-based backdoor
detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat.Ablation
studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require
fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural
network layers in backdoor mapping.Overall,BadBlocks significantly reduces the
barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects.It enables attackers to
inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade
GPUs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering to translate legacy cybersecurity playbooks into the standardized CACAO format, improving automation and interoperability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing playbooks are in non-machine-readable formats, hindering automation and interoperability in cybersecurity response.

Method: The approach combines LLMs with Prompt Engineering, includes a syntax checker, and uses iterative refinement to minimize errors.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in accuracy, preserves workflow structures, and reduces errors significantly.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for practical use in automating playbook transformation tasks.

Abstract: Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous,
non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and
interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response
platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models,
combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident
response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We
systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully
design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for
control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a
syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative
refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate
the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy
playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook
transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow
structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for
practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

### [392] [MPCA-based Domain Adaptation for Transfer Learning in Ultrasonic Guided Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02726)
*Lucio Pinello,Francesco Cadini,Luca Lomazzi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A transfer learning framework using MPCA and CNN improves damage localization in UGW-based SHM, reducing errors across diverse materials and sensor setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and poor generalization limit UGW-based ML methods for SHM. This work aims to overcome these issues with a novel TL approach.

Method: Combines MPCA for shared feature extraction and fine-tuning of a pre-trained CNN to adapt to new domains without large datasets.

Result: Tested on 12 cases, the method significantly reduces localization error compared to standard TL techniques.

Conclusion: The MPCA-based TL framework is robust, data-efficient, and effective for UGW-based SHM.

Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their
integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted
to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale
deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited
generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework
based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage
localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to
have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source
and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling
effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about
dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained
CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed
MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different
composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess
domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a
substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.
Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and

*Meng Zhou,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ClinicalFMamba, a CNN-Mamba hybrid, combines local and global features for efficient 2D/3D medical image fusion, validated clinically for brain tumor classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CNNs, Transformers) have limitations in global context modeling or computational efficiency, hindering clinical deployment.

Method: Proposes ClinicalFMamba, a CNN-Mamba hybrid with tri-plane scanning for 3D volumetric data, enabling efficient long-range modeling.

Result: Superior fusion performance on three datasets, real-time capability, and improved brain tumor classification accuracy.

Conclusion: ClinicalFMamba offers an efficient, clinically viable solution for multimodal medical image fusion.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from
different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment
planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing
approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context
effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the
cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment.
Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling
efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan
mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the
clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we
propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D
images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively
learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on
three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple
quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the
clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification
tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method
establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion
suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

*Pengwei Sun,Wei Peng,Lun Yu Li,Yixin Wang,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate realistic 3D counterfactual brain MRIs using anatomy-guided generative models, evaluated on ADNI and NCANDA datasets, revealing limitations in preserving non-targeted structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating realistic 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical and causal constraints, aiming to improve understanding of disease mechanisms and data generation.

Method: Six generative models are adapted into 3D counterfactual approaches using an anatomy-guided framework with regional brain volumes as conditioning inputs, evaluated on T1w MRIs from ADNI and NCANDA.

Result: Anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies targeted regions but struggles with preserving non-targeted structures.

Conclusion: The work sets a foundation for interpretable generative modeling of brain MRIs but calls for new architectures to better capture anatomical interdependencies.

Abstract: Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating
hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in
understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data.
However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical
and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural
complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we
convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by
incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which
regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is
evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness
and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the
generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results
indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the
targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving
non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable
and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark
highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture
anatomical interdependencies.

*Farzad Beizaee,Sina Hajimiri,Ismail Ben Ayed,Gregory Lodygensky,Christian Desrosiers,Jose Dolz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: REFLECT introduces a novel framework using rectified flows for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MR images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with single-step inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate localization of anomalies in brain imaging without labeled data is challenging due to complex brain anatomy and limited abnormal examples.

Method: REFLECT leverages rectified flows to create a direct, linear trajectory for correcting abnormal MR images to a normal distribution, enabling single-step inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show REFLECT significantly outperforms existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods on brain segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: REFLECT provides an efficient and precise solution for anomaly detection and localization in brain imaging, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in brain imaging is crucial for
identifying pathologies without the need for labeled data. However, accurately
localizing anomalies remains challenging due to the intricate structure of
brain anatomy and the scarcity of abnormal examples. In this work, we introduce
REFLECT, a novel framework that leverages rectified flows to establish a
direct, linear trajectory for correcting abnormal MR images toward a normal
distribution. By learning a straight, one-step correction transport map, our
method efficiently corrects brain anomalies and can precisely localize
anomalies by detecting discrepancies between anomalous input and corrected
counterpart. In contrast to the diffusion-based UAD models, which require
iterative stochastic sampling, rectified flows provide a direct transport map,
enabling single-step inference. Extensive experiments on popular UAD brain
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that REFLECT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. The code is available

*Puzhen Wu,Mingquan Lin,Qingyu Chen,Emily Y. Chew,Zhiyong Lu,Yifan Peng,Hexin Dong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AMD-Mamba is a multi-modal framework for AMD prognosis, integrating fundus images, genetic variants, and socio-demographic data. It uses a novel metric learning strategy and Vision Mamba for improved feature representation and prognosis accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMD is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss, necessitating effective prognosis for timely intervention. Current methods lack integration of multi-modal data and global disease patterns.

Method: AMD-Mamba combines color fundus images, genetic variants, and socio-demographic variables. It employs metric learning with AMD severity scores and Vision Mamba for local and global feature fusion. Multi-scale fusion enhances prediction.

Result: Evaluated on AREDS dataset, AMD-Mamba identifies a significant biomarker for AMD progression. Combining it with existing variables improves early detection of high-risk patients.

Conclusion: AMD-Mamba offers a precise, proactive approach for AMD management by leveraging multi-modal data and advanced feature learning.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible
vision loss, making effective prognosis crucial for timely intervention. In
this work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD
prognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates
color fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At
its core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that
leverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the
model to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with
clinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis
methods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing
models that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local
information, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and
simultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular
changes. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale
fusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different
resolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818
color fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic
variables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the
progression of AMD. Notably, combining this biomarker with other existing
variables yields promising improvements in detecting high-risk AMD patients at
early stages. These findings highlight the potential of our multi-modal
framework to facilitate more precise and proactive management of AMD.

*Tongxu Zhang,Zhiming Liang,Bei Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A survey on learning-based shape analysis for medical point clouds, covering registration, reconstruction, and variation modeling, with trends like hybrid representations and generative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds offer a compact, surface-preserving alternative for 3D medical imaging, but challenges like data scarcity and clinical robustness remain.

Method: Comprehensive review of literature (2021-2025), summarizing methods, datasets, and metrics for shape analysis tasks.

Result: Highlights trends (e.g., hybrid representations, self-supervised models) and challenges (e.g., inter-patient variability).

Conclusion: Future directions include advancing point cloud-based shape learning for clinical applications.

Abstract: Point clouds have become an increasingly important representation for 3D
medical imaging, offering a compact, surface-preserving alternative to
traditional voxel or mesh-based approaches. Recent advances in deep learning
have enabled rapid progress in extracting, modeling, and analyzing anatomical
shapes directly from point cloud data. This paper provides a comprehensive and
systematic survey of learning-based shape analysis for medical point clouds,
focusing on three fundamental tasks: registration, reconstruction, and
variation modeling. We review recent literature from 2021 to 2025, summarize
representative methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight
clinical applications and unique challenges in the medical domain. Key trends
include the integration of hybrid representations, large-scale self-supervised
models, and generative techniques. We also discuss current limitations, such as
data scarcity, inter-patient variability, and the need for interpretable and
robust solutions for clinical deployment. Finally, future directions are
outlined for advancing point cloud-based shape learning in medical imaging.

*Bo Zhang,JianFei Huo,Zheng Zhang,Wufan Wang,Hui Gao,Xiangyang Gong,Wendong Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Nexus-INR is a novel framework for adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution, leveraging diverse knowledge and downstream tasks to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based methods are limited to fixed upsampling factors, and INR-based methods struggle with multi-modal images. Nexus-INR addresses these gaps.

Method: Nexus-INR uses a dual-branch encoder, knowledge distillation with cross-modal attention, and an integrated segmentation module to enhance reconstruction and segmentation.

Result: Experiments on BraTS2020 show Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in super-resolution and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Nexus-INR effectively combines diverse knowledge and tasks to achieve high-quality, adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution.

Abstract: Arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) provides crucial flexibility for
medical image analysis by adapting to diverse spatial resolutions. However,
traditional CNN-based methods are inherently ill-suited for ARSR, as they are
typically designed for fixed upsampling factors. While INR-based methods
overcome this limitation, they still struggle to effectively process and
leverage multi-modal images with varying resolutions and details. In this
paper, we propose Nexus-INR, a Diverse Knowledge-guided ARSR framework, which
employs varied information and downstream tasks to achieve high-quality,
adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution. Specifically, Nexus-INR
contains three key components. A dual-branch encoder with an auxiliary
classification task to effectively disentangle shared anatomical structures and
modality-specific features; a knowledge distillation module using cross-modal
attention that guides low-resolution modality reconstruction with
high-resolution reference, enhanced by self-supervised consistency loss; an
integrated segmentation module that embeds anatomical semantics to improve both
reconstruction quality and downstream segmentation performance. Experiments on
the BraTS2020 dataset for both super-resolution and downstream segmentation
demonstrate that Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various
metrics.

*Yifei Sun,Zhanghao Chen,Hao Zheng,Yuqing Lu,Lixin Duan,Fenglei Fan,Ahmed Elazab,Xiang Wan,Changmiao Wang,Ruiquan Ge*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GL-LCM, a deep learning model for fast and high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images, addressing limitations of existing methods like computational inefficiency and loss of texture details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bone structures in CXR images obscure critical details, complicating diagnosis. Existing diffusion-based methods fail to balance bone suppression with detail preservation and are computationally demanding.

Method: Proposes GL-LCM, combining lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion, with Local-Enhanced Guidance to mitigate boundary artifacts.

Result: GL-LCM outperforms existing methods in bone suppression and computational efficiency on datasets SZCH-X-Rays and JSRT.

Conclusion: GL-LCM offers a practical, efficient solution for bone suppression in CXR images, enhancing diagnostic clarity.

Abstract: Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for pulmonary diagnosis raises significant
challenges, primarily because bone structures can obscure critical details
necessary for accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning,
particularly with diffusion models, offer significant promise for effectively
minimizing the visibility of bone structures in CXR images, thereby improving
clarity and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, existing diffusion-based methods
for bone suppression in CXR imaging struggle to balance the complete
suppression of bones with preserving local texture details. Additionally, their
high computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical
use in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a
Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model
combines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion,
enabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle
potential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we
further propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without
additional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset
SZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers
superior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency,
significantly outperforming several competitive methods. Our code is available

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MRI-based models for predicting post-prostatectomy ED slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches but did not surpass clinical-only models. Fusion models showed marginal gains, with clinical features remaining the strongest predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether preoperative MRI adds predictive value for ED at 12 months post-radical prostatectomy, beyond established clinical predictors.

Method: Four modeling strategies were tested: (1) clinical-only baseline, (2) classical models with handcrafted MRI features, (3) deep learning on MRI slices, and (4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical data.

Result: MRI-based models (max AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted approaches (AUC 0.554) but were inferior to clinical-only models (AUC 0.663). Fusion models (AUC 0.586) did not exceed clinical performance.

Conclusion: MRI-based models did not outperform clinical predictors but may complement them in future multimodal approaches, as they focus on relevant anatomical regions.

Abstract: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important
for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical
features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI
remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional
predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling
strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current
state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features
derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and
(4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models
(maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches
(AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models
offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only
performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to
predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model
suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the
prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve
predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they
try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement
clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Ayodeji Ijishakin,Juan Eugenio Iglesias,Tomomi Takenaga,Yukihiro Nomura,Takeharu Yoshikawa,Osamu Abe,Shouhei Hanaoka*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CADD, a conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images, improves anomaly detection in brain scans by incorporating clinical context and a novel inpainting strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting pathology in heterogeneous medical datasets is challenging. Normative modeling and diffusion models show promise but lack clinical context and accurate healthy region restoration.

Method: CADD combines conditional diffusion modeling with a novel inpainting strategy to balance anomaly removal and feature retention, leveraging clinical information.

Result: CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities across diverse clinical datasets.

Conclusion: CADD advances normative modeling by integrating clinical context and improving anomaly detection in real-world medical data.

Abstract: Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital
archives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images.
However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult
challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers
a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is
modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to
disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly
detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and
generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration;
differences between the original and restored images highlight potential
abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model
approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important
context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard
approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor
reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the
first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide
the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting
strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific
features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans,
which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities
in heterogeneous cohorts.

TL;DR: SecoustiCodec is a low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech codecs struggle with semantic encoding issues like residual paralinguistic information, incomplete semantics, and lack of streaming support.

Method: Proposes a cross-modal aligned codec using VAE and FSQ for quantization, contrastive learning for semantic disentanglement, and multi-stage optimization for convergence.

Result: Achieves PESQ scores of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SecoustiCodec effectively addresses key challenges in speech codecs and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language
models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding,
such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion),
insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack
of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose
SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that
disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook
space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity,
paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between
semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method
based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is
proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens
while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method
based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a
joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic
information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage
optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence.
Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA
(state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps.
The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the
completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo,
code, and model weights.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: PatchDSU improves out-of-domain generalization for speech tasks by splitting inputs into patches and augmenting each independently, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing distribution shifts in speech systems due to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity, which challenge deep learning models.

Method: Extends Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) by splitting input into patches and independently augmenting each patch to handle temporal speech data.

Result: PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods, with PatchDSU showing more consistent improvements across scenarios.

Conclusion: PatchDSU is effective for out-of-distribution generalization in speech tasks, especially in noisy and diverse conditions.

Abstract: Deep learning models excel at many tasks but rely on the assumption that
training and test data follow the same distribution. This assumption often does
not hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due
to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.
  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each
neural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the
problem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a
multivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled
features from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying
DSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static
visual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram
- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a
simple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics
when applied to the entire input.
  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose
PatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and
independently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside
other methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM.
Additionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music
noise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing
model performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases,
both PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods. Notably, PatchDSU demonstrates
more consistent improvements across the evaluated scenarios compared to other
approaches.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaLV-OS, an ML-specialized OS designed to enhance ML performance by tailoring the OS architecture to ML workloads, particularly in virtualized clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on using ML to improve OS decisions, but lacks exploration of using OS to enhance ML performance. This paper addresses this gap.

Method: MaLV-OS includes a micro-kernel (Micro-LAKE) for GPU usage in kernel space and an MLaaS subsystem for memory management and CPU scheduling. It offloads system-sensitive ML parts to the OS and integrates GPU virtualization.

Result: MaLV-OS aims to improve ML model performance by dynamically adapting OS resources and policies to ML workloads, with flexibility for future enhancements.

Conclusion: MaLV-OS represents a novel approach to optimizing ML performance through OS specialization, offering potential benefits for ML applications in virtualized environments.

Abstract: A large body of research has employed Machine Learning (ML) models to develop
learned operating systems (OSes) and kernels. The latter dynamically adapts to
the job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network
bandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has
in common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and
to the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,
using OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level
optimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML
context. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this
paper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and
algorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS
rethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,
especially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML
applications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,
Micro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an
MLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE
with memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads
system-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity
and programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an
open-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.
For more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to
dynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model
the user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the
MaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the
MLaaS subsystem.

*Mikołaj Sienicki,Krzysztof Sienicki*

Main category: physics.hist-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework (QAL) for quantum mechanics based on subjective experience, replacing traditional mathematical abstractions with introspective dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the observer paradox in quantum mechanics by grounding it in first-person experience rather than external abstractions.

Method: Introduces the Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL), modeling physical systems as evolving streams of introspective units (qualia).

Result: Reinterprets quantum concepts (superposition, collapse, entanglement) in terms of subjective dynamics and semantic resonance.

Conclusion: QAL offers a post-Platonist, introspective approach to physics, embedding the observer within the system and resolving linguistic gaps in quantum theory.

Abstract: We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in
external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of
subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical
systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of
modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert
space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a
form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective
contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams
of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight
theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics
reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a
formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a
vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within
the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We
analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with
standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a
post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.

Motivation: Standardized registry systems are needed for AI agent discovery, identity, and capability sharing in diverse environments.

Method: Survey and comparison of three registry approaches (MCP, A2A, NANDA) based on their metadata models and features.

Result: MCP uses centralized metadata, A2A supports decentralized interaction, and NANDA offers verifiable, privacy-preserving metadata.

Conclusion: The paper provides recommendations for future registry system designs to enhance the Internet of AI Agents.

Abstract: As As autonomous AI agents scale across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized
environments, the need for standardized registry systems to support discovery,
identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three
prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's
mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized
metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for
server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent
Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct
configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically
verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic
discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These
approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability,
authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and
recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the NANDA framework for secure, interoperable AI agent ecosystems, addressing discovery, authentication, and collaboration across protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between AI agent capabilities and infrastructure needs for secure, scalable multi-agent collaboration.

Method: NANDA framework with AgentFacts for verifiable capability attestation, Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA), and Agent Visibility and Control (AVC) mechanisms.

Result: Enables interconnected, verifiable AI agent ecosystems, ensuring security, interoperability, and governance.

Conclusion: NANDA provides foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous agent deployment, advancing next-gen intelligent systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift
from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems
requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability
verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol
environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the
fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and
interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents
in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery,
cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and
cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol
(MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS
communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles,
extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous
agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks,
and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control
(AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational
autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents
into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent
services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous
agent deployment across enterprise and consumer environments. This work
addresses the critical gap between current AI agent capabilities and
infrastructure requirements for secure, scalable, multi-agent collaboration,
positioning the foundation for next-generation autonomous intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of static endpoint resolution (e.g., DNS, static URLs) in heterogeneous environments, ensuring flexible, secure, and scalable agent interactions.

Method: Agents advertise capabilities via Agent Fact cards in a registry. Requesters use the registry to discover and resolve tailored communication channels based on context (e.g., location, load, security).

Result: Enables dynamic, context-aware communication with support for trust negotiation, QoS, and resource constraints, surpassing traditional client-server models.

Conclusion: AdaptiveResolver offers a scalable, secure foundation for evolving agent communication in complex ecosystems.

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address
the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in
distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs,
AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication
endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent
capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and
context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A
requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester
Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication
channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents.
The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and
resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable
agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model.
AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent
communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

*Abhishek Vijaya Kumar,Eric Ding,Arjun Devraj,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Morphlux is a programmable photonic fabric for interconnecting accelerator chips in servers, improving bandwidth and reducing compute fragmentation, leading to better ML training throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the interconnect bandwidth wall caused by faster FLOPS scaling of accelerators compared to interconnect bandwidth, leading to under-utilization of GPUs.

Method: Develop Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, and demonstrate its benefits through a hardware prototype.

Result: Improves bandwidth by up to 66%, reduces compute fragmentation by up to 70%, and achieves 1.72x better ML training throughput.

Conclusion: Morphlux effectively addresses interconnect limitations, enhancing performance and reliability in ML-centric datacenters.

Abstract: We optically interconnect accelerator chips (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) within compute
servers using newly viable programmable chip-to-chip photonic fabrics. In
contrast, today, commercial multi-accelerator compute servers that are
workhorses of ML, use electrical interconnects to network accelerator chips in
the server. However, recent trends have shown an interconnect bandwidth wall
caused by accelerator FLOPS scaling at a faster rate than the bandwidth of the
interconnect between accelerators in the same server. This has led to
under-utilization and idling of GPU resources in cloud datacenters. We develop
Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, to interconnect
accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art photonic
ML-centric datacenters with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant
compute allocations by up to 66% and reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%.
We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate
these performance benefits, which translate to 1.72x improvement in training
throughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our
hardware testbed, Morphlux can logically replace a failed accelerator chip in
1.2 seconds.

Conclusion: SleepLiteCNN is a practical, effective solution for real-time sleep apnea subtype detection in energy-constrained wearable devices.

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions
lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour.
Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes -
Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and
management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying
these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal
resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a
wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning
architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity,
and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a
compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed
for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92%
macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit
quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further
demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its
suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained
environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective
solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.

### [412] [Veli: Unsupervised Method and Unified Benchmark for Low-Cost Air Quality Sensor Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02724)
*Yahia Dalbah,Marcel Worring,Yen-Chia Hsu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Veli is an unsupervised Bayesian model using variational inference to correct low-cost sensor readings for urban air quality monitoring without needing reference stations, supported by the Air Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban air pollution is a severe health crisis, but low-cost sensors (LCS) face issues like drift and calibration errors, limiting their reliability.

Method: Veli employs variational inference to disentangle true pollutant readings from sensor noise, eliminating the need for co-location with reference stations.

Result: Veli generalizes well across settings, handling sensor drift and erratic behavior, and is supported by AQ-SDR, the largest AQ sensor benchmark.

Conclusion: Veli offers a scalable, reference-free solution for accurate air quality monitoring, with public code and dataset availability.

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature
deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable
monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable
alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected
by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these
challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent
Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference
to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,
eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a
disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the
true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address
the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air
Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor
benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across
multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor
drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made
public when this paper is published.

*Chunyu Liu,Hao Zhang,Wei Wu,Fuhui Zhou,Qihui Wu,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Chan-Byoung Chae*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SpectrumFM, a spectrum foundation model, enhances spectrum cognition with improved generalization and accuracy using a novel encoder and self-supervised learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectrum cognition methods lack generalization and accuracy in diverse environments, necessitating a more adaptable solution.

Method: Proposes SpectrumFM with a spectrum encoder combining CNNs and multi-head self-attention, plus self-supervised tasks (masked reconstruction, next-slot prediction) and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods: 30% better detection probability in SS, 10% higher AUC in AD, and 9.6% improved WTC accuracy.

Conclusion: SpectrumFM offers a robust, adaptable solution for spectrum cognition tasks, significantly improving performance across diverse applications.

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum
utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing
spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal
accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed
SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative
spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the
multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both
fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the
spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are
developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and
transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly
adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum
sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification
(WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over
state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in
the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under
the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

TL;DR: A method to extract range and Doppler info from Wi-Fi CSI using a single transceiver, overcoming hardware and coupling challenges with innovative signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi hardware without full-duplex capabilities, addressing phase errors and antenna coupling issues.

Method: Proposes time offset cancellation, phase alignment correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation for accurate CSI phase utilization.

Result: Achieves cm-level accuracy in range and Doppler estimation, validated with Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC, enabling moving object detection and tracking.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of precise sensing with off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware, no modifications or specialized capabilities needed.

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and
Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using
a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi
sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex
operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces
significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of
interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both
challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment
correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level
accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a
commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and
tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the
feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet
communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or
specialized full-duplex capabilities.

Method: Uses a DRL agent with PPO and ISAC for dynamic threat assessment and probing. Includes curriculum learning for effective training.

Result: Achieves 92.8% mean attacker detection rate and maintains 13 dB average user SINR.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances security and communication performance, proving robust against advanced attacks.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility
to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security
threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against
these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing
and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat
assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious
activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that
guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to
overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a
security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive
policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance.
Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker
detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper explores strategies to improve PPG-based sleep staging, comparing single-stream models with dual-stream cross-attention methods using PPG and auxiliary data like synthetic ECG. Experiments on the MESA dataset show significant performance gains with the dual-stream approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable sleep staging using PPG alone is challenging, motivating the need for enhanced methods to improve accuracy in wearable sleep monitoring.

Method: The study compares single-stream models with dual-stream cross-attention strategies, leveraging PPG and auxiliary data (e.g., augmented PPG or synthetic ECG).

Result: Experiments on the MESA dataset demonstrate substantial performance improvements when combining PPG with auxiliary information under the dual-stream architecture.

Conclusion: Dual-stream cross-attention with PPG and auxiliary data significantly enhances sleep staging performance, offering a promising direction for wearable sleep monitoring.

Abstract: Sleep monitoring through accessible wearable technology is crucial to
improving well-being in ubiquitous computing. Although
photoplethysmography(PPG) sensors are widely adopted in consumer devices,
achieving consistently reliable sleep staging using PPG alone remains a
non-trivial challenge. In this work, we explore multiple strategies to enhance
the performance of PPG-based sleep staging. Specifically, we compare
conventional single-stream model with dual-stream cross-attention strategies,
based on which complementary information can be learned via PPG and PPG-derived
modalities such as augmented PPG or synthetic ECG. To study the effectiveness
of the aforementioned approaches in four-stage sleep monitoring task, we
conducted experiments on the world's largest sleep staging dataset, i.e., the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis(MESA). We found that substantial
performance gain can be achieved by combining PPG and its auxiliary information
under the dual-stream cross-attention architecture. Source code of this project

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A self-supervised method called 'concurrence' is introduced to measure complex non-linear dependencies in signals without prior knowledge, validated across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological systems exhibit complex non-linear interactions that current methods cannot capture without prior knowledge, limiting scientific discovery.

Method: The 'concurrence' approach distinguishes between temporally aligned and misaligned signal segments to identify dependencies.

Result: Concurrence successfully exposes relationships across fMRI, physiological, and behavioral signals without ad-hoc tuning or prior information.

Conclusion: Concurrence is a powerful tool for scientific discovery, though researchers must validate dependencies to ensure relevance to their questions.

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary
tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit
complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a
priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a
self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation
that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish
between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them.
Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our
knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships
across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant
differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori
information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields.
However, depencencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus
researchers should validate that exposed relationships truely pertain to the
question(s) of interest.

Motivation: Noisy sensor data limits real-time monitoring and decision-making in modern engineering systems.

Method: Proposes a physics-informed denoising framework combining energy-based models and Fisher score regularization, validated on benchmark problems and applied to LPBF data.

Result: Outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, reducing noise effectively in LPBF experiments.

Conclusion: Enables robust real-time interpretation of sensor data, improving control and defect mitigation in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Modern engineering systems are increasingly equipped with sensors for
real-time monitoring and decision-making. However, the data collected by these
sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for
control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising
framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to
jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based
model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the
simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across
varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal
emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate
model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing
noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided
denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor
data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in
additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of
Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture,
hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental
pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which
defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated
organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there
exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice
using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the
communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding
of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome
communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome
communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a
multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is
conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological
signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart
agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of
agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed.
These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things
enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and
eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges,
open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are
discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance hedging strategies for exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models using path signatures.

Method: Deep learning: signatures as features in feedforward networks. Shallow learning: two regression approaches—direct learning from price process signatures and modeling volatility dynamics with signature models.

Result: Signature-based methods outperform LSTMs in deep learning and provide more accurate, stable results in shallow learning.

Conclusion: Path signatures are effective for hedging exotic derivatives, offering computational efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: We investigate the use of path signatures in a machine learning context for
hedging exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models. In
a deep learning setting, we use signatures as features in feedforward neural
networks and show that they outperform LSTMs in most cases, with orders of
magnitude less training compute. In a shallow learning setting, we compare two
regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the
expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of
volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected
signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated
signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across
different payoffs and volatility dynamics.

*Zhanye Luo,Yuefeng Han,Xiufan Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal Component Analysis (SDDP) for dimension reduction in time series forecasting, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors by incorporating target-awareness into factor extraction.

Method: Introduces SDDP, a supervised framework combining target variable and lagged observations with a temporal neural network to scale predictors and perform PCA.

Result: SDDP enhances forecasting accuracy and yields interpretable, target-specific factors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SDDP is effective for high-dimensional forecasting and adaptable to partially observable predictors, validated by real-world datasets.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving
time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel
Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that
incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor
extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct
target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised
manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting
power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware
predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor
extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting
task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors.
Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting
model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches.
To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies
to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially
observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on
several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm
achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A Likelihood Matching method for training diffusion models is proposed, using quasi-likelihood to approximate reverse transitions and ensuring consistency in moments. Theoretical guarantees and empirical validation are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the training of diffusion models by matching the likelihood of the target data distribution with the reverse diffusion path, ensuring accurate and efficient generation.

Method: Uses quasi-likelihood to approximate Gaussian reverse transitions, estimates score and Hessian functions, and introduces a stochastic sampler for computation.

Result: Consistency and non-asymptotic convergence guarantees are established, with empirical validation showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: The Likelihood Matching approach is effective for training diffusion models, with theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: We propose a Likelihood Matching approach for training diffusion models by
first establishing an equivalence between the likelihood of the target data
distribution and a likelihood along the sample path of the reverse diffusion.
To efficiently compute the reverse sample likelihood, a quasi-likelihood is
considered to approximate each reverse transition density by a Gaussian
distribution with matched conditional mean and covariance, respectively. The
score and Hessian functions for the diffusion generation are estimated by
maximizing the quasi-likelihood, ensuring a consistent matching of both the
first two transitional moments between every two time points. A stochastic
sampler is introduced to facilitate computation that leverages on both the
estimated score and Hessian information. We establish consistency of the
quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, and provide non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees for the proposed sampler, quantifying the rates of the approximation
errors due to the score and Hessian estimation, dimensionality, and the number
of diffusion steps. Empirical and simulation evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed Likelihood Matching and validate the theoretical
results.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gradient-based training of a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation in high-dimensional settings, focusing on optimization and sample complexity. It explores the SGD dynamics and derives scaling laws for prediction risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of gradient-based training in high-dimensional regimes and derive scaling laws for prediction risk, especially in feature learning scenarios.

Method: The study uses SGD dynamics analysis, matrix Riccati differential equations, and matrix monotonicity arguments to analyze the training of a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation.

Result: The paper presents scaling laws for prediction risk, highlighting dependencies on optimization time, sample size, and model width, with power-law decay assumptions.

Conclusion: The analysis provides convergence guarantees for infinite-dimensional dynamics and insights into the feature learning regime for high-dimensional neural networks.

Abstract: We study the optimization and sample complexity of gradient-based training of
a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation function in the
high-dimensional regime, where the data is generated as $y \propto
\sum_{j=1}^{r}\lambda_j \sigma\left(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta_j},
\boldsymbol{x}\rangle\right), \boldsymbol{x} \sim N(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$,
$\sigma$ is the 2nd Hermite polynomial, and $\lbrace\boldsymbol{\theta}_j
\rbrace_{j=1}^{r} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions. We
consider the extensive-width regime $r \asymp d^\beta$ for $\beta \in [0, 1)$,
and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients
$\lambda_j\asymp j^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis
of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population
limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws
for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the
optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a
precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation
with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees
for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.

*M Tanjid Hasan Tonmoy,Rahath Malladi,Kaustubh Singh,Forsad Al Hossain,Rajesh Gupta,Andrés E. Tejada-Martínez,Tauhidur Rahman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AeroSafe enhances indoor air purification using a robotic cough emulator and digital-twins-based analysis to predict aerosol dynamics, outperforming static filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current air filters ignore cough-generated aerosols, risking high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities.

Method: Uses a robotic dual-agent emulator (cough mannequin and air purifier) and digital twins (physics-based model + LSTM/graph convolution).

Result: Predicts aerosol concentration with 35-second mean error; real-time strategies beat static filters.

Conclusion: AeroSafe effectively mitigates airborne pathogen risks in real-time.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

### [426] [GACL: Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning with Active Task and Performance Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02988)
*Linji Wang,Zifan Xu,Peter Stone,Xuesu Xiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning (GACL) is proposed to automate curriculum learning for robotics, addressing challenges like complex task spaces and partial domain knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual curriculum design for robotics is labor-intensive and suboptimal. Automated methods struggle with robotics' complexity and partial domain knowledge.

Method: GACL introduces (1) a robust task representation, (2) adaptive curriculum generation based on performance, and (3) grounding to maintain domain relevance.

Result: GACL improves success rates by 6.8% in wheeled navigation and 6.1% in quadruped locomotion compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GACL effectively automates curriculum learning for robotics, enhancing performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

*Haojun Xu,Jiaqi Xiang,Wu Wei,Jinyu Chen,Linqing Zhong,Linjiang Huang,Hongyu Yang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SkeNa introduces a navigation task using hand-drawn sketch maps, supported by the SoR dataset and the SkeNavigator framework, which outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human navigation strategies using sketches, the paper aims to develop an agent that navigates unseen environments using only hand-drawn maps.

Method: Develops the SoR dataset with 54k trajectory-sketch pairs and an automated sketch-generation pipeline. Proposes SkeNavigator, using RMD for sketch feature representation and DAGP for goal prediction.

Result: SkeNavigator significantly outperforms prior methods, improving SPL by 105% on high-abstract sketches.

Conclusion: The work advances sketch-based navigation with a novel dataset and framework, demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: Optimized running gaits for bipedal robot Cassie, compared to human biomechanics, and demonstrated a record-setting 100m dash controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-speed running on hardware and compare robot gaits to efficient human running mechanics.

Method: Optimized gait efficiency across speeds, compared to human biomechanics, and integrated gaits into a full controller for the 100m dash.

Result: Key gait properties were similar to humans, and the controller set a Guinness World Record.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridged robot and human running mechanics, achieving high-speed performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

*Yi-Hsuan Hsiao,Andrea Tagliabue,Owen Matteson,Suhan Kim,Tong Zhao,Jonathan P. How,YuFeng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 750-mg flapping-wing robot achieves insect-like agility using a deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller and imitation learning, improving speed and acceleration by 447% and 255% over prior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance gap between aerial insects and insect-scale robots, due to low inertia, fast dynamics, and environmental susceptibility, motivates the development of a high-rate feedback controller for aggressive maneuvers.

Method: A deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller and imitation learning train a neural network resembling insect flight control architecture for high-rate feedback in compute-constrained systems.

Result: The robot achieves lateral speed of 197 cm/s and acceleration of 11.7 m/s², handles 160 cm/s wind disturbance, and performs 10 body flips in 11 seconds.

Conclusion: This work marks a milestone in insect-scale flight agility, paving the way for future research on sensing and compute autonomy.

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

*Bojan Derajić,Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi,Sebastian Bernhard,Wolfgang Hönig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid MPC local planner using a learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from HJ reachability analysis, achieves higher success rates with similar computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the infeasibility of real-time HJ reachability analysis, the paper proposes a learning-based approximation for safe and efficient motion planning.

Method: The method approximates the HJ value function as a difference of a signed distance function (SDF) and a neural residual, modeled with a hypernetwork for real-time performance.

Result: The planner achieves up to 30% higher success rates than baselines, with comparable computational effort and low travel-time solutions.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances safety and efficiency, demonstrating superior performance in simulations and hardware experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniFucGrasp introduces a universal functional grasp annotation strategy and dataset for diverse dexterous hands, improving grasp stability and task-specific manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasp datasets focus on stability, neglecting functional grasps for tasks, and rely on costly, high-DOF hands.

Method: Biomimicry maps human motions to robotic hands, using geometry-based force closure for functional, stable grasps.

Result: The method enhances functional manipulation accuracy, grasp stability, and generalization across robotic hands.

Conclusion: UniFucGrasp addresses annotation cost and generalization challenges, validated by experiments and a synthesis model.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiWA introduces an offline framework for fine-tuning diffusion policies with RL, using a world model to improve sample efficiency and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in fine-tuning diffusion policies with RL due to long denoising sequences and high real-world interaction requirements.

Method: DiWA leverages a world model for offline RL-based fine-tuning of diffusion policies, reducing dependency on environment interactions.

Result: DiWA improves performance on the CALVIN benchmark with significantly fewer interactions than model-free baselines.

Conclusion: DiWA demonstrates efficient offline fine-tuning of diffusion policies for robotic skills, enhancing practicality and safety.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single

and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset
sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and
depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance,
even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements,
including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7%
improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high
detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the
system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: READ is a real-time diffusion-transformer framework for talking head generation, using compressed latent spaces and a novel noise scheduler to improve speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for talking head generation are slow, limiting practical use. READ aims to achieve real-time performance without sacrificing quality.

Method: READ uses a temporal VAE for compressed video latent space, a SpeechAE for audio alignment, and an A2V-DiT backbone. It introduces an asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for consistency and speed.

Result: READ generates high-quality talking head videos faster than state-of-the-art methods, maintaining stability in long-time generation.

Conclusion: READ successfully balances speed and quality in talking head generation, making it practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of OSINT and misinformation in the Russo-Ukrainian war, distinguishing genuine intelligence from deceptive efforts.

Method: Analyzed 2 million tweets from 1,040 users (Jan 2022-Jul 2023) using sentiment analysis, partisanship detection, misinformation identification, NER, and community detection.

Result: Found negative sentiment tied to war events, nuanced partisanship (pro-Ukrainian/Russian), strategic misinformation, and distinct clusters in information spread.

Conclusion: Provides insights into digital warfare and misinformation dynamics, enhancing understanding of OSINT in geopolitical conflicts.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on Twitter
regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war, distinguishing between genuine OSINT and
deceptive misinformation efforts, termed "BULLSHINT." Utilizing a dataset
spanning from January 2022 to July 2023, we analyze nearly 2 million tweets
from approximately 1,040 users involved in discussing real-time military
engagements, strategic analyses, and misinformation related to the conflict.
Using sentiment analysis, partisanship detection, misinformation
identification, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), we uncover communicative
patterns and dissemination strategies within the OSINT community. Significant
findings reveal a predominant negative sentiment influenced by war events, a
nuanced distribution of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian partisanship, and the
potential strategic manipulation of information. Additionally, we apply
community detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters
partisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of
information spread on social media. This research contributes to the
understanding of digital warfare and misinformation dynamics, offering insights
into the operationalization of OSINT in geopolitical conflicts.
